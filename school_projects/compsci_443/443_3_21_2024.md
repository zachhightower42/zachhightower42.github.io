# Confidence Intervals
The confidence interval specifies the range where the estimate for a property resides, in the specified amount of probability. 

One can think of it as having two parts.
*Confidence level* 
The level of confidence the statement is made
*Interval* 
The actual interval where we say the value resides within our full range 

# How do we compute a confidence interval?

When we have a lot of samples, it starts to approximate a Gaussian. When we reach a certain level of samples, we can use the Gaussian distribution. 

The amount of samples before this is appropriate is usually **30** 

# Critical z value

This is the z- value where 95% of the samples fall within the range covered by the value.
