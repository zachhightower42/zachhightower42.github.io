## Access Dbfs

- Data bricks is the way we access a VM (virtual machine) that lets us use more computing power (theoretically) than we can use on our local system. 
- Allows us to use separate cells in a nice format for working with data analysis and things of that nature.
## review
- There will be some Latex coding on the exam E.g Writing out stuff by hand `\frac{1}{2}` Section 1 of hw3
- Questions similar to section 2 on hw3, identifying error.
