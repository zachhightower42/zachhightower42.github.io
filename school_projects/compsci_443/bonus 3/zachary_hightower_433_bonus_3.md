Given a binary sparse square matrix with size nxn and the locations of non-zero elements specified in a 2-d array B of size 2xm (each column of B corresponds to a location of a 1 in the matrix, i.e, row index and column index), find the number of 2x2 submatrices that contains k 1's in it (k=0,1,2,3,4). 

Input: n (integer), B (2xm integer array)

Output: 1x5 array C where C[i] is the number of 2x2 submatrices that contains i 1's.

Your method should run in O(m). Please submit pseudo code.
