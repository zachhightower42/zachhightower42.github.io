Homework #6

Due: 9:30am Tuesday 3/5
Submission: Upload a text file (txt or pdf) to the blackboard. No late submission will be accepted.

Answer whether the following questions are true of false (1 point each)

1. T F  x86 is a RISC type ISA
	Ans-1. False, x86 is a Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC), type

2. T F  ASM programmers do not need to know ISA
	Ans-2. False, though it isn't strictly necessary for ASM programmers to know ISA, it is integral in order to build properly optimized programs. Which is why I think False is the most correct answer here. 

3. T F  ISA does not include machine instructions
	Ans-3. True, ISA does not, itself, include machine instructions. It translates more directly to machine instructions, but it does not actually have them. Like how languages derived from Latin translate more easily into Latin, but none of them actually include Latin directly.  

4. T F  There is only one fixed microarchitecture for each ISA
	Ans-4. False, there can be many microarchitectures for ISAs

5. T F  Moore's law implies that the computing power of a single chip doubles every 18~24 months'
	Ans-5. True

6. T F  %eax is a 32-bit x86 register that can hold a memory address
	Ans-6. True, it is a general purpose 32-bit x86 register that can be used to hold Integer numbers or memory addresses. 

Answer the following questions (2 points each)

7. List all 32-bit x86 integer registers
Ans-7.
- %eax
- %ecx
- %edc
- %ebx
- %esi
- %edi
- %esp
- %ebp

8. What is PC register for?
Ans-8. A PC register is a register that holds the memory address of the next instruction that is in line to be done by the processor.
