### Three types of instructions

Perform ALU operation on register or memory data
E.g., `addl (%edx),%eax`

Move (transfer) data between memory and register
Load data from memory into register
Store register data into memory 
e.g., `movl 8(%eds),%eax`

Control execution flow
Unconditional or conditional branches
e.g., `jmp .L1`
