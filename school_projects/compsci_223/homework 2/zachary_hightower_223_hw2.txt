Q: The marketing department at your company has promised customers that the next software release will show a 2x performance improvement. You have been assigned the task of delivering on that promise. You have determined that only 80% of the system can be improved. How much (in percentage) would you need to improve this part to meet the overall performance target? Hint: use Amdahl's law.

A: We need a performance input twice the original amount in the next software release. Only 80% of the system can be improved. In the equation for Amdahl's law, we can represent our problem as.

1 / (1-p) + p/s = 2

Where p is the original proportion of what we can improve as it existed in the system. We know this is 80 percent, or .80
s is the speedup of the part of the task that can benefit from improvement. 
We use 2, because the theoretical speed we want to achieve is twice as fast as it is now. 

Placing our values into the equation, we get.

1 / (1-.8) + .8/s = 2

If we perform the calculation, we arrive at the least amount we can increase the systems we can act on to achieve our desired output. 

8/3 or 2.7, roughly.

Represented as a percentage improvement, we need to improve the 80% of the system by 270% to meet the stated goal.
