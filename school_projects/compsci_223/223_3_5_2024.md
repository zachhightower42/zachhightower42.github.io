### HL vs LL vs Machine Code
Between different programming languages the output of the HL to the assembly language may be different, but there's likely not going to be much difference, and it will still be translated into the ISA of the machine.


| hl -> | compiler-> | ll  |
| ----- | ---------- | --- |
| c     | Front end  | x86 |
| java  | Middle End | ARM |
| Rust  | Back end   | PPC |
| c#    |            | ... |

> "Say we're building a processor together called 223. We can change the backend to generate the output we need, and we can develop, if we have our own programming language, the front end to generate what we need into any of the assembly languages necessary."


### First look at x86 Assembly program
- L or l in the case of machine code means 4 byte size

### Assembly Programmer's view

### 32 bit x86 integer registers
- The number of registers from 32 bit to 64 bits doubles

### Different types of Operand
1. Immediate: Constant integer data 
	- Example: `$0x400,$-533`
	- A dollar symbol should be in front of the two above
	- Encoded with 1,2, or 4 bytes
2. Register: One of the 16 Integer registers
	- Example: %rax, %r13
	- but %rsp is reserved for special use (pointing to stack memory)
3. Memory: 8 consecutive bytes of memory at address given by register or constant number
	- Examples: (%rax), 0x10001000 
	- Examples are indirect, then direct
	- Has various other *address modes*
