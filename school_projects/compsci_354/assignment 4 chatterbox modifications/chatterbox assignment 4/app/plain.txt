Let's go in the town square
You'll find something waiting
Right there where you left it lying upside down
When you finally find it, you'll see how it's faded
The underside is lighter when you turn it around
Everything stays right where you left it
Everything stays
But it still changes
Ever so slightly, daily and nightly
In little ways, when everything stays
Go down to the bookshop
The crystal chimes a-ringing
Dusty shelves crowded with leatherbound tales
Crack your favorite open, and live it again
But the story now has shifted, or maybe, it's you
Everything stays, right where you've left it
Everything stays, but it still changes
Ever so slightly, daily and nightly
In little ways
When everything stays
