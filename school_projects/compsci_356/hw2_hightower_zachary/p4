Question: Give the Big-O performance of the following code fragment:

for i in range(n):
   for j in range(n):
      for k in range(n):
         k = 2 + 2

Answer: Since we have three nested loops here that all operate with respect to the input
variable and they do not halve in size after the loop, we can safely say that this
time complexity of big O of O(n^3)
