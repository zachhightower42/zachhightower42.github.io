# Cross validation 
Null hypothesis testing on the final
Skew bias
Confidence intervals
etc. 

# Alpha values
Alpha value = the percentage of times that this event, or a more extreme event of the sort investigated will occur by luck 

# Boneferroni adjustment

# False discovery rate
Defining a false discovery rate (Benjamin and Hochberg, 1995)

1. Perform all the m hypothesis tests and rank the p-vlaues
2. Calculate individual $\alpha$ levels
$$\alpha_{i}= (\frac{i}{m})\times FDR$$
3. Compare P-vlaues to $\alpha_i$
- starting with the smallest, compare each p-value to its $\alpha_i$
- The largest p(i) such that p(i)<$\alpha_i$ and all smaller p-values are considered significant
- All larger p-values are rejected (deemed insignificant)

Often used in genomics or neuroscience where testing for many hypotheses at once 


# Cross validation examples
- step 0 divide the data into k folds
Typically the data is between five and 10, where each fold is of an equal size. Each one should be big enough to serve as an individual holdout, relatively even organization. 

- step 1, set aside one
- step 2, do training on all but the set aside one
- step 3, test on the one set aside
- step 4, repeat steps 1 to 3, setting aside a different one each time.
