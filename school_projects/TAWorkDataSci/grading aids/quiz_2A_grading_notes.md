**Q1:** The correct answer for this is **Selection bias** , because our results are going to be skewed by the fact that we are specifically selecting customers with a more positive opinion for the survey. 

**Q4:** The most desirable data here is low variance, low bias. Both of these are good for making determinations and coming to a solid conclusion. 

**Q5:** The most desirable data is that with high variance and low bias. The overall goal is to get useful data, and bias is a worse issue than high variability in, so the first option in this questions is correct.


**Q6:** The correct answer here is 77 rows, the data set does have 5 columns total, but the rows are 77.

**Q7:** The correct answer is given by **101256**, the 50%, or 50th percentile, which corresponds to the median, the value that is in the exact middle of all the points in the dataset. 

**Q9:** There are no missing values in the data set, if there were, one, or more, of the columns that should have a discrepancy between the total entries meant to be in it, and the amount of non-null values reported by info. **E.g** 77 total rows in a column, but only 75 of those rows have non-null values. So there would be two missing values in this example

**Q10:** The state with the best overall options, considering the best overall options for getting a job as the **state** with the most desirable **cities**, and the most **cities** that have good prospects for software developers, is Texas.

**Q11:** The worst **state** is the state with the worst overall options, considering the cost of living to salary ratio for software developers in the **cities** of that state, is California.

**Q12:** (Giving all examples and answers for ease of grading)
Year = discrete, usually reported as integers, not as fully continuous **Example:** 57.25 would be considered a continuous number, while the integer 2000, would not. 
Age = discrete
Race = nominal, **nominal** means not given to any natural order E.g. Ice cream flavors
Education = ordinal, **ordinal** means it **does** have a natural order E.g. first, second, or third place **OR** one, two, or three stars
Jobclass = nominal
Health Insurance = nominal
Wage = continuous 



**Q13:** The interquartile statistic values is given by the formula
51 - 33.76 = 17.25 <- Interquartile statistic number for age column

To put it another way
75% value - 25% value = 17.25 <- Interquartile statistic number for age column

**Q14:** The correct answer to this is **No,** it can appear at first that on average, salary and age increase together, but the plot of average wage vs. age shows a clear variability that means this statement is false.  For example, the a 70 year old and older is more likely to have a lower average wage than a 30 year old, according to the graph. 

**Q15:** The correct answer here is **Lower** because the **average wage** is 111.7036 (given by the table) and according to the average **age vs. wage plot**, this number should be less then 110

**Q16:** The range of ages that earn the highest wages is roughly **30 - 60**

**Q17:** The best answer is less than 25th percentile, however, the answer of between 25-50th percentile is acceptable, because there can be some vagueness in the plot. 

**Q18:** The full answer for this question is to look at the scatter plot and realize it is too crowded in some areas to make a good determination of its contents. Then, one must provide a reasonable solution to this, either by making the data easier to interpret by the use of darker color for more dense areas, or by decreasing the overall opacity of the dots, so that their outlines will be easier to see.
