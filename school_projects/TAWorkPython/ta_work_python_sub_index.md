# TA Work — Python Classes (Index)

This page links to the files and examples I worked on as a TA at the University of Mississippi. Click any item to view the file.

Rubrics were all provided by Dr. Christina Trotter and I had most of my discussions with her, since I was the lead TA for her and was only part of the TA team for Melody's class.

Lab 12 was only held by Melody's Python class, Dr. Trotter was focusing on the finals with her students at that time and didn't hold a lab.
