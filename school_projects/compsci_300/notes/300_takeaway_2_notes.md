. Roughly how long have smartphones existed?

. What types of data do smartphones (the phones, not the apps on the phones) collect.

. How do social media companies make revenue?

. What are data brokers?

Answering first the questions posed in the group task, then going on to my personal takeaway.

- Smartphones have been around since the early 1990s. (IBM Simon)
- Smartphones collect location data, text message data, call logs, and internet access data
- Social media companies make revenue selling ads and user data
- Data broker is someone who sells the data, usually collected in the previously talked about methods

Personal takeaway

It is surprising to think about how much the world changed for people right before the turn of the century. I was born in January at the start of 1998, so I grew up seeing a lot of things change really quickly. Smartphones ended up effectively eating a lot of other technologies. GPS, pagers, scanners all got slotted into one device. This seems to be something the smartphone industry wants to continue, as apple are now putting LIDAR scanners into new ipads as a new feature. It seems to be part of an overall goal to create one tool that can do everything.
