- Big 3 ethical frameworks
	- Deontological theory - Put forth by Immanuel Kant. Concerned about following the 'rules' 
		- If you follow the rules, even if there's a bad outcome, you're still a moral upstanding citizen
	- Utilitarianism - Promoted by John Mills (and I think Thomas Hobbes) This one is concerned with the outcomes. Usually written as maximizing the total happiness of people/ the total utility of the ethical or moral decision. 
	- Natural rights and negative/positive rights or liberties - biggest proponent would be John Locke, big proponent of natural rights.
		- Natural rights are things that you get just by virtue of being born
