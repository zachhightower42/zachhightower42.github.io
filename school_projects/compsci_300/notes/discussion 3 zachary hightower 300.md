Read section 3.5 and be able to discuss both the pros and cons of online anonymity.
- What are some legitimate reasons to be anonymous online?
	- Posting unpopular opinions
	- Posting about actual issues that a large company might want to seek legal reprecussions for (SLAPP suits are a very clear example of how this can happen)
- What are some legitimate reasons governments and law enforcement would trace anonymous accounts back to the real individual?
	- The users have done a crime/have been posting about doing crime
	- Like the fact that the low level cleaning and maintenance guy for the NSA started taking pictures of classified documents and uploading them to his shitty alt right Discord
- Search online for “North Carolina Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson scandal.” What are your views concerning his online account being traced back to him?
	- Politicians are people making the active choice to go into the public eye and should hold up under intense scrutiny. Having one's history examined in minute detail is a part of that.
