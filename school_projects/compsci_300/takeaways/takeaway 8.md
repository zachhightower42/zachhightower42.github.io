Chapter 6: Discussion Exercise 6.35 (p. 349)
Description

--Read the statement about percentages of women earning CS degrees.

--Discuss amongst your group why so few women major in CS (and other engineering fields).

--Is there consensus in your group as to why?

--Discuss the ethical implications of a male-dominated CS career field.

--What changes (academic, corporate, social) could improve the percentage?

1. I have 100 percent read the statement
2. it may stem from the image of a computer scientist as a man. Leading figures and those credited with development of new techniques, new software, new hardware, are usually men. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Linus Torvald are the ones that we can point to as being the biggest figures in computer science. All of them men. However, there have certainly been significant strides taken by women in the history of computer science. The first NASA mission owes most of its calculations to women. One of the most important member's of Alan Turing's code breaking group in WWII was a woman. This could be an issue with women getting pushed into roles where they are only given calculations to do. There is a history of women being given the labor intensive roles in scientific fields. In astronomy, this was usually viewing star charts or tracking constellations. In mathematics, intense calculations work was given to women rather than be done by the men. 
3. TBD
4. Having a male dominated field means there will be a distinct lack of female point of view in most projects. It also means that for any woman trying to enter the field, they'll be facing a very clear imbalance in gender dynamics. That can lead to the majority abusing their power over the minority.
5. Dynamic could be changed by better recognition of the contributions of women to the field. The advent of work from home could help to reduce possible issues stemming from toxic corporate culture. Academia could offer targeted aid packages for the intersection of groups that produce computer scientists that also contain majority women. 
# Actual takeaway
 After discussing in class about the lack of women in STEM and specifically the lack of female representation in computer science fields, we could not come to a particular conclusion. The clearest idea that came out was that it appears to be in a large way due to the weight of precedent. There are not very many females in compsci, which creates a less friendly environment, which leads less women to choose it. Meaning that the reason there are no women in computer science is that there are no women in computer science. We also explored the idea that there is an issue with women historically being given the less prestigious, more labor intensive tasks. Now that things are less labor intensive in computer science, women may have been pushed deliberately out. Solutions could be things like better networking, earlier introduction, and a more intense study of how systems can become slanted towards a particular gender.
