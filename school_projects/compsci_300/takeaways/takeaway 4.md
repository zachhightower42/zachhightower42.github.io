From the topics discussed today, I was most interested in the right to privacy and where each of us chooses to draw the line. While it's true that I wouldn't want an investigative journalist looking into all my dirty laundry, I don't feel wrong wanting all of a political hopeful or incumbent's skeletons unearthed from their closet. I realize it's somewhat of a double standard. There's not much I can think of to do about it, though. Those things need to be known about someone who is going to be put in charge of money and state systems. To not do one's homework in that regard seems an invitation for catastrophe. It's something that I think needs more testing and more study. How much surveillance is good?
