Groups 1 - 2 and 5 - 7 have case scenarios from the chapter to discuss. Each group should be able to describe the scenario to the class and answer the following:

--Who are the stakeholders and their rights?

--Who is the decision maker and their responsibilities?

--What are the risks, problems, consequences?

--What are the benefits?

--What are the potential actions? Do you recommend one action over another and why?

# Answers
## Overview
--Who are the stakeholders and their rights?
	Stakeholders are the people and organizations affected by the given scenario/product. Each of them holds a 'stake' in things, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Voluntary stakeholding would be signing on to a business proposition. Involuntary stakeholding would be something like being born in a given country. You then hold a certain stake in that country.  
	The rights of stakeholders are the things that they are able to do with their stake, or things that their stake does to them. A person who is a citizen in a country, for example, is usually given the right to vote by their stake. They are also given the right of being under the country's laws and regulations, which is something that they *must* (must meaning they are obligated to do so and will face consequences if they do not) do. 
--Who is the decision maker and their responsibilities?
	The decision maker is the person who is capable of making an active decision in any given scenario. They are the ones imbued with agency. 
--What are the risks, problems, consequences?
	Risks are issues that are inherent to the scenario, usually
	Problems are issues that result from the current scenario, which may be acted upon by those with agency
	Consequences are the ripples spreading out from the decisions made which change the situation. These can generally be termed negatively or positively. 
--What are the benefits?
	Benefits are the positive consequences. However, benefits for some could mean a balancing negative consequence for other parties. That is why it's important to identify who actually receives the benefit.
--What are the potential actions? Do you recommend one action over another and why?
	Potential actions are any actions that one may take in a given scenario. The various options that are presented to those that have agency. 

## Specifics
--Who are the stakeholders and their rights?
- The team
- Patients
- Investors/supplier of cash and resources, will refer to this as the government from here on as that appears to be the one funding the project
--Who is the decision maker and their responsibilities?
**Decison maker:** Project Manager
**Responsibilities**
 - Consider Senior Management's preference to release on time
 - Release a quality product 
 - Respect the needs of my development team and their input
 - Ensure the safety of the patients/end-users
--What are the risks, problems, consequences?
**Risks**
- Kill or maim patients with radiation
- Cause business kerfuffle
- Cause legal fuckery
- Get fired
- Get my team fired
- Potentially forever mar the name of the business associated with patient deaths
- Show up in a documentary about unethical science/capitalsim
**Problems**
- Senior management prefers to have this done on time
- Patients should not be put in danger of being killed if at all possible to avoid
- Development team may be severely overworked/stressed due to project delays
- May cause treatment issues by not releasing on time
	This one is mostly due to hospitals making time to install things as soon as they are ready. Any delays here could be bad for those that would have been treated if the hospital was operating at full capacity and didn't have a wing closed to install new radiation machines. 
	Could also consider how many will be able to be treated now that would otherwise not receive treatment, versus those who may be injured by the device. 
**Consequences**
- Mostly covered by risks, however there are positive consequences, will go over these in benefits
--What are the benefits?
**Benefits**
- Senior management is happy due to an on time release
	- Benefits mostly me and development team
- Bugs are squashed and product is sent out later than expected
	- Benefits everyone in the long term
	- High short term benefit to the patients
--What are the potential actions? Do you recommend one action over another and why?
**Potential actions**
- Release early 
	- without doing full bug testing
	- without doing full bug testing, but continue testing and roll out patches as they are found
- Release late while doing full bug testing


Personally I think that this is one with an easy solution. You might be able to optimize it in some ways. Such as rolling it out partially so that the release isn't delayed. However this may require more work overall than simply saying that the release needs to be postponed. It really just depends on the specifics of the situation. How much of the problems are hardware versus software. How much of it is something we could send out versus needing to ship it as a complete package. How difficult would it be to compile a list of possible cases we have not tested the equipment for and know that it is sufficiently comprehensive to allow hospitals to get on with their work and us to roll out the product early without doing the full bug testing to ensure that it is as safe as we can possibly make it. I suppose this serves as a show of how even clear ethical scenarios may have a lot of good options. There is not necessarily one fully correct answer.
