Description

--After reading section 5.5.2, who in your opinion has the most responsibility for security? Is it better to say the responsibility is shared? Why/why not?

--What are the textbooks recommendations for passwords?

--What is “penetration testing?” How does this differ from unethical hacking?

--What is “responsible disclosure?”

# Reading
- After 5.5.2, in my opinion the person who has the most responsibility for security are the distributors of software.  I'd say it's better to say that the responsibility is shared. Because there are a lot of things that a user can do to compromise a secure system. Users can't be prevented from doing a lot of these things because they're important for the actual function of a system. E.g clicking on a link in an email. 
- Wouldn't be comfortable flying a new Boeing airplane even if they told me that they caught Osama Bin Laden's ghost and won a nobel peace prize. 
- Penetration testing differs from unethical hacking because there is an informed party within the organization that has signed off on the testing of the systems. This helps to actually test systems and how they would respond to a genuine threat, without suffering the potential losses associated with an actual hack or interference in the system being pen tested. 
- Choose strong passwords. Change passwords periodically. Do not use the same password for multiple purposes.
	- However, changing passwords as often as has been recently recommended leads to weaker passwords and often leads to people re-using the same password as before with slight changes.

- Responsible disclosure is disclosing things in a set period of time after finding out about it. Say someone found out about a bug causing a site to offer access to vulnerable data while it's processing on a server. It is irresponsible disclosure to immediately make it public when there is no fix available. Responsible disclosure is making it public to ensure that people will know that there is an issue and that companies will be pressured to actually implement the fixes. 
- The implications for the trial if Apple had lost are myriad. This is always the case with the establishment of a legal precedent in a case. The case itself could have been used in the future to prove that there is a right for law enforcement to have access to any data once probable cause for search is established or a warrant has been issued. The immediate fallout would be the creation of an OS version that renders Iphone security heavily compromised. There could be additional vulnerabilities introduced to the overall ecosystem of Apple devices and things running or connected to that OS. Since there would now be a weaker link in any Iphone with that OS installed, hackers would have a clearer target to strike at. 

# Actual takeaway
 Security needs constant updates to close loopholes in order to protect systems that we all depend on. Even having lots of support does not prevent issues from happening. Though it does mean that we will know about them a lot sooner, in most instances. We've yet to have another issue on the same level as Heartbleed. We learned that infrastructure, especially widely used infrastructure, needs plenty of support. We have not yet moved towards a more diverse environment that would reduce the threat created by using common platforms though. Making it more difficult to get returns on investment would be a good way to reduce incentives for malicious hacking. The difficulty in that would be making it easier for less computer savvy persons to actually install a different OS or use a different platform. There doesn't seem to be a simple solution available there.
