--Be able to describe what happened and the result. How did Sam Altman make the situation worse?

--What is the right to publicity? Is this a federal protection, or state-by-state?

--In your opinion, is it ethical for a company or individual to impersonate another individual? Why/why not?

1. From reading
   - Similar instances of this have happened in the past, with people who were trained specifically on the celebrity voice failing to present as different. 
   - Not protected by parody since there is no technical parody involved, the material is being used completely in earnest. 
   - Will an argument that the developers may not know entirely how the AI compiles and creates the voice model hold up in court? Precedent is against this.
2. How did Altman make it worse?
   - Issues with using the word 'her' in an official company post which was seen as referencing the movie Her that Scarlett starred in as a fictional AI voice
3. What is right to publicity? Federal or state by state?
   - Right to the publicity arising from the unique characteristics or identifying portions of one's persona. 
   - It is state by state, no federal law for this. 
4. Is it ethical for a company or individual to impersonate another individual? Why, why not?
   - I think it should be legal for impersonations to be done if they are specifically advertised as impersonations. E.g. How Elvis impersonators operate. When it's being used as a cheaper version of the persona that detracts from the value of the original, that should be illegal/ is unethical. However, parody interpretations of a person's persona should be protected.

# Actual takeaway

The overall thrust appears to be that artificial intelligence can be used at a tool effectively to make tasks easier for its users. However, it is seeing too much use. It appears that a lot of individuals with the ability to use AI don't fully appreciate its limitations and want to use it in a way that it is not in any way ready for. Instead of use as a tool, it is being used as a full replacement for human work. In my opinion it can be used to analyze things better, in cases like cancer diagnosis or genome mapping. However it cannot be used to make determinations based on the data it has analyzed. As in making a treatment plan now that the diagnosis has been made. Even reaching the point where we can say that we trust it for diagnoses and genome mapping requires us to test the model and the analyses provided extensively, and there is always the issue of a model reaching a breaking point where it encounters unfamiliar territory. So, artificial intelligence and machine learning are interesting tools with the ability to make lives significantly easier and better, but it is not a cure all.
