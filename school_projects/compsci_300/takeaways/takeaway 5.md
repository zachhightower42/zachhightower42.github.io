The discussion today about copyright and what might be an ethical reason for privacy is what stuck in my mind. My opinion is that piracy is something that should happen to a certain extent. The reason I have that opinion is that I've read of several times in history that huge amounts of media would have been entirely lost, if someone hadn't been pirating it. The incident that I can distinctly recall is when a teacher recorded every broadcast of the news for decades, and kept it on VHS. That collection of VHS tapes, found after her death, ended up being the only repository for that news station's broadcasts. The weather reports alone are cited in several breakthroughs in tracking the changing climate. Without her pirating those broadcasts, there would have been no record for researchers to work from.
