I was interested most by the topic on the use of location tracking. Though what I was thinking about did pop up in the other discussion as well. Laws always seem to react to technological developments and new uses for tech. It seems to me that it would make more sense to have a few defensive laws or require approval by a government board. It could help to tamp down some of the more invasive uses of new technology. Though how this could be implemented is difficult to say. It would also have the effect of freezing out development in certain sectors, especially AI, if they were required to use only datasets that were legally acquired. Whether this would be good or bad long term is difficult to say.
