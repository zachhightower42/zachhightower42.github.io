# Zach's Art Corner 

This is for all my personal projects. Most of my writing is in roleplaying groups these days, but I still do some of my own writing. The voice work is mostly just me reading stories I like, I may upload some silly videos or things to the youtube channel that hosts them later. The artwork is my attempt to get better at sketching and painting, I think I've gotten much better than I used to be, and I look forward to seeing how it helps me visualize things and think about the world. Thanks for taking a look!
