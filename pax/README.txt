Todo
- [ x] Unfuck the issue with trait points not updating properly
- [ x] Allow user to select as many trait radio buttons as they have trait points
- [ x] Add in a hidden trait that is selected only when the user has Avian as a race
to represent their ability to fly
- [] fix display for proficiency points not updating properly. Bug: proficiency display is not
tied correctly to the formula (skill points + trait modifider) + (invested proficiency points * 2)
- [ ] Consider adding shopping functionality, maybe in a seperate page
