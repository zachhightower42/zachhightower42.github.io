Miscellaneous Melee
Gun-Butts
Long Weapons
Two-Handed | Long | Heavy | RNG 1 | DAM 10 | Destruction 2 | +1 to Hit Rolls

Short Weapons
One-Handed | Short | Light | RNG 1 | DAM 6 | +2 to Hit Rolls

Bayonets
If a melee weapon has the Affixable trait, you may pay ฿1 to have a mount placed on a firearm of your choice.  The affixed weapon can be used without needing to spend an action to swap weapons.  Putting on or taking off the affixed weapon takes an action.  While a weapon is affixed to your firearm, you suffer a -1 to Hit Rolls using both weapons.

Throwables
If a weapon is Light, it is considered Throwable.  This will cost 2 Stamina.  Thrown range is your Combat score.  If you are Adept in throwables, you gain +4 range.  A successful hit will be treated as a successful melee strike.  Throwables are Silent.
You can throw Heavy weapons if you are Proficient in Throwables.  You’ll suffer a -4 penalty and lose 4 Stamina.
You can throw Unwieldly weapons if you are Adept in Throwables.  You’ll suffer a -6 penalty and lose 6 Stamina.

Improvised and Exotic Melee
On occasion, players may find exotic weapons, or have need of a melee weapon when they have none equipped – it is natural to resort to your environment.  Improvised weapons will be given stats, penalties, and the like on the go.  Defer to the GM.
