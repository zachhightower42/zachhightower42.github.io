dimVitrarius: Now you only have to import everything from Poage's game.
Doc (GM): Yep.
Cassie May: I really hope you can just copy the entire sheet from Poage's game when you get rights there
Scott P.: I can do that~!
Doc (GM): IT DONE.
Oh hi Yuppie.
Yuppie b.: hello doc
Doc (GM): What are you doing, you saucy minx you?
Yuppie b.: I am coming to check out the stage
and take a gander at the characters again
>One is actually taller than Whitney
Yay!
Now she can pretend to be of normal height
Doc (GM): THIS HEIGHT WAS PASSED DOWN THE ARMSTRONG FAMILY LINE FOR GENERATIONS.
Reginald Percival Grenfell FLEXES.
Whitney G. Elieen: lol good healthy living is what has made me tall
Whitney G. Elieen PRAYS
Reginald Percival Grenfell: "Incredible valor."
"RESPECTABLE MUSCLES."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Unshakeable faith"
"GOD IS MY ROCK"
Reginald Percival Grenfell extends a hand to Whitney and bends down to one knee in one motion.
Reginald Percival Grenfell: "Miss Whitney."
"Would you make me the most happy man that has ever walked these dust covered lands?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "Oh Sir Reginald..." She says with a smile as she pulls him up to his feet. Perhaps one of few
who can actually do such a thing.
"Walk with me and become the happiest man to have lived. Both on the dusty roads of earth and the golden
streets of the city eternal."
Reginald Percival Grenfell swoons with a whole lot of ham. He manages to take out two ceiling lights and
leave a good dent in a side of the train.
Reginald Percival Grenfell: "Oh this is wonderful."
"Splendid."
"Our children will have faith and joy passed down their line FOR GENERATIONS!"

Whitney G. Elieen: "I HAVE PRAYED TO THE HEAVENS TO DELIVER UNTO ME A MAN NOT AFRAID OF MY
HEIGHT AND GOD GIVEN STRENGTH AND THE LORD HAS HEARD MY PRAYERS"
"REJOICE FOR GOD IS GOOD"
Reginald Percival Grenfell grabs Whitney and lifts her up as tears of joy run down his chiseled jawline.
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: "...Ah really need ta quit drinkin'."
Whitney G. Elieen swoons like a southern girl in the spiritual heat of an awakening. Taking out the entire
side of the train in the process of doing so.
Scott P.: "..."

Crystal Saint Claire runs away crying.
Crystal Saint Claire runs into a door.

Doc (GM): I derailed my own canon with memes.
Whitney G. Elieen: >in a jealous rage Crystal designs the first ever shrink ray

Crystal Saint Claire: (That could happen but it would take years to create properly.)
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: (Welp, RIP campaign)
Crystal Saint Claire: Why

Nevermore is also going to update my sheet.
Cassie-May O'Brien: even more ammo, a saber, speedloaders, more knives, loads of spare clothes, (assless)
chaps, duster, boots, actually paid for my Stetson, minor things
Yuppie b.: That's a good idea actually
I need to buy some spare clothing
Yuppie b. almost forgot her Saturday dress
Nevermore: We'll be in town for a little bit.
It'll be the perfect time
Right.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano: Well, in a second, I think the train's gonna be making a stop and we'll gain our next

Nephi "Longiron" Delano: Alrighty.

Alexander Hauswald: There's two of me.
Poage: I ma have been a tad overzealous.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: We'll delete whichever one is less complete.
Alexander Hauswald: Aaaalright.
Then yes. I'm done.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: Now we're going to introduce you!

Nephi "Longiron" Delano: He's probably reading the 2000 page reading assignment he just got.
Poage: Somethinglike that, yes.

Yuppie b.: It is in fact school related. He will get to us when he has time. There are other things he also has to do
ontop of that.
Cassie-May O'Brien: I'm starting to think that
Cassie is some sort of a bootleg Kiddo
crazy prepared
Yuppie b.: Likewise I feel Whitney is a sort of bastardize cross between Frozen and Karabou and Pill.
Large and hardy, Faithful and gentle, and maybe a little unsettled.
Alexander Hauswald: I have no idea who Alexander is supposed to be
I already HAVE a gun-wizard OC and they're nothing alike
Poage: Crystal is literally Crystal.
Brb
Yuppie b.: Frozen and Pill are actually other people's characters. Frozen in particular is Varmus's who is currently
in a relationship with my tortured war criminal deer. Pill is a "Stock priest character" and you of course know who
Kara is.
Cassie-May O'Brien: Frozen is a nearly unkillable, masculine lumberjack.
Nearly unkillable as in really clings to life absurdly hard.
Not invincible, despite my best efforts.
Alexander Hauswald: I remember
Most people don't fucking survive something called "shotgun abortion"
Cassie-May O'Brien: Pfft
old news
she forgave the mare that shot her
hug and all
Yuppie b.: She has grown quite a bit from that time.
Cassie-May O'Brien: she also has been shot through with a literal cannon like three times so far
damaged so badly that she's literally on Dark Magic life support now
Yuppie b.: It certainly was a process from killing our baby to forgiveness.
Alexander Hauswald: Will putting her in a 40k-style dreadnaught be a downgrade?
Yuppie b.: To top it off she is in love with a sometimes promiscuous deer who at times keeps secrets and is
almost as tortured as her. Mentally at least.
She is also one hundred times more masculine than said deer.
Cassie-May O'Brien: Actually
she already was in something like that
literal power armor.
Alexander Hauswald: No, specifically a dreadnaught

Cassie-May O'Brien: then those disappeared after they timetravelled because an ancient time golem told them to
do so or he deletes reality.
Alexander Hauswald: An armored coffin powered solely by her rage
Cassie-May O'Brien: There is no rage left in Frozen Horizon
just exhaustion, disappointment, confusion and feeling of utter powerlessness.
Poage: I am back
Whitney G. Elieen: Welcome back!
Poage: So what do you think the odds are we meet Bani Karl, Fastest Knife in the West during a one-off?
And he's still a penguin
he jsut wears a cowboy hat, and nobody questions it.
Except for the Ranger.
Crystal just assumes he's from Pittsburgh
Crystal Saint Claire: "The all have that accent!"
Also, Nev, you here?
I need some help wit a number or two, and some gear..
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: Eh?

But I need gear help

Nephi "Longiron" Delano: Why do you have all this money
Crystal Saint Claire: 500 dollars starting equipment

Crystal Saint Claire: Did you ask Doc if he had anything planned for your introduction?
If he doesn't then we could probably write you in on the spot, no?
But if he does then I don't wanna step on that.
So we are probably not the ones to talk to about whether you're gonna be needed or not.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is leaning against the door of the train, canteen in hand, looking out over the
miles of countryside rolling by.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks out into the distance, almost like he can see something out there. His gaze

strange runes stamped shallowly into the surface.

"Lightning repeater. It's a hand me down, but it's the same one my big brothers used. If it was good enough for

Crystal Saint Claire pulls the pistol slightly further from the carpetbag, revealing the shotgun attachment.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Niiice."
"Think you could fit one on my rifle?"
"That'd be a way better surprise than some bayonet."
Crystal Saint Claire: "...I am currently attempting to prototype something to that effect."
"It would be odd, and similar to tying a shotgun to your rifle."
"The reason it works with the pistol is that a shotgun and a pisto, are about the same size, mechanism-wise."
"Perhaps the way to do it would be to use the same hammer mechanism... And simply place a full shotgun barrel
beneath the rifle's barrel?"
"It would likely need to be made of ghost steel."
"Otherwise it would become prohibitively heavy."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Unless a sawed-off length barrel was used."
"But then one would have to use a separate trigger mechanism for the shotgun, adding more maintainence and
potential for error."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Attach it to the side of the body"
"Then you pull it when somethin uppity gets too close."
"Maybe like"
"Twist it first?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "If there is not a safety, shifting one's grip on the firearm might cause premature gunfire..."

Crystal Saint Claire: "You would have to push forward, twist counter-clockwise, and then pull back, firing the
shotgun.
"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Maybe it'll make sense when I'm lookin at it."
Crystal Saint Claire: "I am unsure how to create a foolproof safety..."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "You'll figure it out. Ah got faith."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Okay. So..."
"If you were pointing the gun forward
There would be a grip of some sort."
"Which hand do you not pull the trigger with?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "And we still got a ways to travel, so you figure it...."
"I'm a lefty. So my right."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Your right hand would be supporting the gun."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Yep."
Crystal Saint Claire: "And where it usually lies, there could be some sort of grip.
"
"You push the grip forward until you hear a click, then turn left until you hear another click, then push forward to
fire."
"No wait you pull back to fire."

Hello!
Varulv: wavewave
Poage: I'm gonna be level with you
Due to an unfortunate coincidence
Crystal is going to be terrified of Reginald for a not-insignificant time.
Varulv: Silly Irish superstition, I'm sure!
Poage: Nah. Sheer trauma.
Varulv: Irish. Superstition.
Poage: Remind me to link you her backstory later~!
Varulv: Why not just put it in the public section of the sheet? =P
Like how Reginald's is.
Poage: Well, how much of his backstory would Reginald bring up? OR talk about if asked?
Varulv: All of it.
At least as far as he's aware himself.
Poage: There are pieces of Crystal's backstory she doesn't remember, and pieces she will not talk about.
Because I drew BOTH DAMN JOKERS
Varulv: =D
Grab the VotWW, for a triple vammy.
Poage: Nah
Wouldn't make sense on the character
Varulv: I'm honestly a little sad I didn't get a joker. More 12's!
But I did get a pretty good hand.
Poage: Yep

S'just so much harder to keep track of who I've told wht to.
Anywho
Take a read!
Crystal Saint Claire has a backstory
Crystal Saint Claire: Anywho
Varulv: Ooohboy.
Someone getting a punchin' if they ever come around.
Crystal Saint Claire: Train is chugga chugga chugging along
...pls no punch me
Reginald Percival Grenfell: Of course not! A gentleman would never pay a finger on a lady.
lay*
Crystal Saint Claire: To my knowledge, he never hit her.
Reginald Percival Grenfell: There are other things covered by 'laying a finger on' than punching.
Anyhow....
Crystal Saint Claire: We could do a late-night stop.
All the others are asleep, or something.
Reginald Percival Grenfell: That also works.
Crystal Saint Claire promised to stop staying up late for Whitney but sometimes she gets ideas in the
middle of the night
Crystal Saint Claire is currently in the dining car, the only place with big enough tables to contain her
work.
Reginald Percival Grenfell was one of the newest arrivals on the train, having gotten on-board at its latest
stop. In fact, he had only just gotten on to the train and found his own compartment, before deciding that
a little night time-drink was the perfect way to round off the day. As he stepped into the dining car, three
things made him stand out from likely anyone else on board: his clothing was near sparkling clean, hardly
a fold to be seen. Not in the coat - that was clearly of military origin, but did not belong to any American
army - or the perfectly tailored suit he wore underneath. Then was his hat, a bowler that one would be
hard pressed to find anyone else in the States wearing. A walking cane despite not seeming like he
needed such aid. And finally: he was huge. In both good senses of the word. So tall he had to lean
forward slightly to get through the doorway, and enough muscles to likely put even a horse to shame.
Reginald Percival Grenfell pauses for a moment after entering and looks around, a light, non-bothered,
smile on his face. Only noticing Crystal, he removes his hat and casually approaches.
Crystal Saint Claire is tinkering with something on a table, currently rummaging in her carpet bag. She
waves back over her shoulder.
Crystal Saint Claire: "I know I said I would sleep Whitney but I had a breakthrough"
"I promise, just one more hour"
Reginald Percival Grenfell: "Forgive my intrusion, madam, but would you happen to know if this establishment
offers nighttime services?" His voice did not at all match the body, seeming more at home with an actor, or singer.

Crystal Saint Claire: "..."
Reginald Percival Grenfell removes his hat, revealing a mostly bald head.
Crystal Saint Claire freezes the moment she hears the unfamiliar voice.
Crystal Saint Claire: The sound of a revolver cocking is distinctive, and carries at least across a silent dining hall.
Reginald Percival Grenfell raises an eyebrow at the sound, but does not seem bothered by it otherwise.
Crystal Saint Claire turns very slowly, one hand in the carpet bag, the other holding onto the table
Crystal Saint Claire: The moment she actually sees Reginald, she's off and running.
Reginald Percival Grenfell: "Apologies if I frightened you, madam." He offers a light bow, hat head against his
chest.
Crystal Saint Claire: Her work is left on the table.
Reginald Percival Grenfell: "Oh bother."
"Madam, please, there is no need to fear," he calls after her.
Crystal Saint Claire: You can hear footsteps going down the train.
Well, away from the dining car.
Reginald Percival Grenfell moves to the table, looking over the assorted items strewn about with mild
curiosity and interest. After studying it for a moment while rubbing his chin thoughtfully, he grabs at bag
and stoves everything down into it, then heads off after the running girl in an attempt to catch up with her.
Varulv: Actually, how old is crystal? In a girl vs woman sense.
Crystal Saint Claire: 15.
Varulv: So girl.
Crystal Saint Claire: She is 15 years of age.
Yeah.
How careful are you with that? It looks like delicate machinery; clockwork.
Reginald Percival Grenfell: Rrrrelatively. Everything goes in the bag, but it's not 'arm on table, brush it all in in
one motion'.
Crystal Saint Claire: Got it.
Crystal Saint Claire has locked herself in a sleeping car.
Reginald Percival Grenfell: How certain would it be that any one of them was hers?
Crystal Saint Claire: She didn't lock herself in her room. Just the first one she could find.
Reginald Percival Grenfell: Would he have seen her enter?
Crystal Saint Claire: The train is pretty unoccupied.
He would have seen her take a hard left into a room, likely.

Reginald Percival Grenfell carefully knocks on the door. "Apologies for scaring you, miss, and for still
bothering, but you left your belongings on the table, I would like to return them to you."
Crystal Saint Claire: "If yer don't step back oi'm gonna shoot."
Reginald Percival Grenfell: "Now, now, I assure there is no need for that. Just let me return your belongings and
I shall be on my way."
Crystal Saint Claire: "..."
"Jist put de bag down an' walk away."
The sounds of furniture moving are evident from the other side of the door.
Reginald Percival Grenfell: "If you are certain, miss, but this is not like back home. The gents of these lands do
not have the tact to simply leave unattended belongings be."
The sound of a bag with... what ever all she has in it can be heard
"I wish you a pleasant evening." And with that, heavy footsteps leaving - back towards the dining cart - can be
heard, before fading.
Crystal Saint Claire: (Thanks for the time! I gotta go..)

Wonderful Cowboy Land: It's a late night when the stop comes up. The train's engine stops chuffing out smoke
and the huge metal beast grinds to a halt. There are two men on the platform. One of them looks fine. The other
looks like death warmed over. The man that looks fine has a suitcase and a dog. The man that looks like he
belongs six feet under has a suitcase tucked under both arms. There is a cobalt six gun on his hip.

Crystal Saint Claire is still holes up in second-guess, having barricaded a sleeper car.
Crystal Saint Claire: Well, a compartment.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is nearby where Crystal is staying.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Hey, Missy Crystal? We've stopped."
"You wanna see who's gonna get on?"
"...Y'been in there an awful long while."
Crystal Saint Claire: "..."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Ishmael would get like that sometimes. She'd always come out for ma's cookin
though."
"...Who's still on the train?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks out the window.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Oh hey, this guy's got a dog."
Crystal Saint Claire: "...the monster"
Alexander Hauswald waits for the train to come to a full stop, his face neutral. He checks- one last timethat his suitcase and the gun on his hip are still there, and that Sacks is held on the leash.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Dunno what you're talking about, but I don't think there's any monsters about. I'm
going to go greet the new fellas, eh?"
Cassie-May O'Brien came over with another mug of tea. Come to think of it, you don't think she slept

Alexander Hauswald doesn't seem to be disturbed- or, rather, if he is, he does a fantastic job hiding it.
"Fair enough."
Crystal Saint Claire: "I have the Opus."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Fair."
Alexander Hauswald snaps his finger at the mongrel by his feet. "Come on, Sacks. We're going."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Whatcha need me for, Miss Crystal?"
Wily Galen steps up onto the train with a little jig and heads towards the sleeper compartments. He walks
past most of the others on the way there. He leaves behind a peculiar smell of light rot.
Crystal Saint Claire: "To explain to Whitney if I must abscond."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano coughs at the stench that passes by.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Yeah, sure, miss Crystal. I ken do that."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks back, anticipating the other entrant.
Crystal Saint Claire: "..."
Alexander Hauswald: "...I don't trust him either, Sacks. Still. We go where we called."
Crystal Saint Claire walks after the slightly rotted man
Alexander Hauswald follows, tugging gently on the leash.
Cassie-May O'Brien wiggled her nose.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Excuse me, sir? Why do you smell of Death? Are you one of the mortially challenged?"
Cassie-May O'Brien tensed up.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is standing near the door of the first train compartment.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks out as Alexander approaches.
Wily Galen opens a sleeper compartment with his foot and pokes his head in to look around. After
ascertaining that no one is occupying it, he trots in and tosses both suitcases down.
(From Cassie-May O'Brien): Does Cassie-May recognize this person from her earlier misadventures or
something?
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers sniffs, getting a good whiff of the smell. "Well shoot, looks like we might jus'
have some... 'musical accompaniment' durin' our travels."
(To Cassie-May O'Brien): This one is new.
(From Cassie-May O'Brien): he is a walking dead like the others, though? Can Cassie recognize that?
Alexander Hauswald looks at Nephi, the stoic emotion on his face softening ever so slightly, before he
nods. "Hello."

Alexander Hauswald looks at Nephi, lifting a brow.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano says, more as if to reassure himself than anyone else.
Alexander Hauswald: "Sure there are."
Wily Galen throws one arm back and braces himself on the bed of the sleeper compartment as he adopts
a relaxed lean.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Not around the Ranger..." He mumbles under his breath.
Cassie-May O'Brien stared flatly at Nephi while taking a sip of coffee.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Sure them are. Dead but nawt done, them are. Met 'em before. Bad news, the lot."
Wily Galen: "What happens up at oven MIT?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "I got a letter recently giving me an excuse to leave Colorado, so I did."
Alexander Hauswald: "...Ranger?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "Mostly education."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks over towards Callie.
Wily Galen: "Never got much of that."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Why nawt?"
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers chuckles. "Ya really think Ah didn't guess y'azll knew there were?"
Alexander Hauswald: "..."
Alexander Hauswald rubs the back of his neck.
Crystal Saint Claire: "I remember a few odd classes in demonology they required we take. Something about
being able to rebut arguments that Ghost Rock was the soul of the innocents and such."
Alexander Hauswald: "...No, Sacks. I'm not telling anyone. Stay silent."
dimVitrarius: hi Yuppie
Alexander Hauswald looks at the dog, seemingly conversing with him.
Wily Galen: "So, you're telling me it's not congealed soul juice?"
Alexander Hauswald: ((Also hi, Yupster))
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Miss Callie's the only law dog here."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Welp, guess we're all on th' same page, 'side from mistah sharpshootah there."
Cassie-May O'Brien motioned at Nephi.
Yuppie b.: Hello hello!
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: "An' long as none of y'all take a shot at me, we're gonna get along jus' fine."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Not even t'keep a secret?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "No sir. Ghost Rock is a silly name. It is simply a porous form of coal containing densities
sulphur, creating the screaming noise and brimstone odor."
Alexander Hauswald: "That works for me."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano frowns.
Wily Galen: "Well, could have fooled me."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers smirks. "Now if ya sing 'Dixie' fer me, Ah might jus' deputize ya too."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano hmmphs!
Crystal Saint Claire: "..."
Alexander Hauswald: "Don't need to. Thank you."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "So, Ah'm gunna take first watch on tha' walkin' dead friend of yers, Alex. Who's gunne
change meh in two hours?"
"...An'. fer the record, where's he?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "We're taking watches now?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "Are you tired? I can go back to my fort..."
Alexander Hauswald: "He's not dangerous."
Whitney G. Elieen: There was a knock upon the door Alexander
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...An' Crystal? An' our amazon nun?"
Wily Galen: "I could use a nap, but it's not essential anymore."
Alexander Hauswald: "Annoying, yes. Not Dangerous."
"....Amazon nun?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Sounds like her now."
Wily Galen: "I like to close my eyes and not think about things for a while."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Eeeeyup. C'mere in, Whitney!"
Wily Galen: "Can't quite sleep right anymore."
"That's as close as I can get."
Whitney G. Elieen: The door opens...
Crystal Saint Claire: "I have been trying to eat better about sleeping. Whitney lets me sleep with her."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: (giggity)
Crystal Saint Claire: "It saves a bed, and I get cold easily. "
Whitney G. Elieen: And in steps an incredibly large woman. Her body hunched over ever so slightly so as not to
hit the celling. A thick set of blond hair atop sparkling blue eyes and an almost impossibly beautiful smile.

Wily Galen: "Makes sense."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Good evening all of you...I have returned from my evening exercises."
Wily Galen: "Might do that if anyone ever wanted to bunk up with me these days."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Hey miss Eileen." He's still getting it wrong.
Wily Galen: "Only one I know of that might do it is Billy."
Whitney G. Elieen: "And I see the lord has graced us with even more company!"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Sure did."
Wily Galen: "He's been off for..."
"Couple weeks now?"
Wily Galen strokes an imaginary length of beard with his free hand.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Have you considered warm, slightly damp blankets? The feel is similar to human
companionship..."
Alexander Hauswald just stares a the massive nun, confused. One hand slowly reached to hold an
absolutely terrified Sacks.
Alexander Hauswald: "...Hello."
Wily Galen: "Warm and damp don't go together too well when you're trying not to rot."
"I prefer not to make whatever's keeping me like this too hard."
Cassie-May O'Brien sipped her coffee, grinning and watching the scene so far.
Whitney G. Elieen: "Do not be frightened...no good soul should ever live in fear of a servant of the lord."
"Whitney Gould Elieen. I am blessed to meet you two."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers chuckles as she leans back and lights a cigar
Crystal Saint Claire: "Than perhaps a heated stone?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "She's a good one, Mister Alexander. No need to stand on a-flutter!"
Alexander Hauswald: "...Alexander Hauswald." He says eventually, offering his hand to Whitney, pointing at the
mongrel in the other hand. "This is Sacks."
Crystal Saint Claire: A pot full of rocks, boiled and dried, would likely be free of microbial life."
Wily Galen: "That's better."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Nephi, Callie, y'all saw Crystal anywhere?"
Whitney G. Elieen reaches forward and grips it with a smile. Her grip is firm. There was a great deal of
strength there...
Whitney G. Elieen: "Alexander and Sacks. I shall say a prayer for the both of you."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "She ran off somewhere."

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: "Uhh... think she followed the corpse."
Alexander Hauswald just shakes it, his face betraying a hint of uneasiness.
Alexander Hauswald: "...Thank you."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...He ain't a corpse."
Whitney G. Elieen: "To thank the lord that he brought you with us...I assume you as well are answering the call of
the Marshall?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano grumbles.
Whitney G. Elieen: "A corpse you say...?"
Alexander Hauswald nods. "Everyone here got the letter?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Yup."
Alexander Hauswald seems to connect the dots.
Alexander Hauswald: "He's a leper."
"Not a corpse."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...See, now that's something that's not crazy talk."
Cassie-May O'Brien tensed up. She moved the coffee mug to the left hand and rested her right on her
revolver, then powerwalked out of the wagon in search of Crystal.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Crystal? Y'all okay there?"
Crystal Saint Claire leans out a door.
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers goes out the door, watching Cassie, her own hand on the handle of her revolver
Wily Galen pokes his head out of the door above the shorter Crystal.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Yes, though I think I may be bothering my new mortially challenged friend."
Whitney G. Elieen: "A leper...an ancient and most wretched disease."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Jesus healed the lepers, didn't he, miss Eileen?"
Wily Galen: "Shit, is there a leper on the train?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "Cruel as sin to the afflicted. Whomever your friend is I shall say a prayer for him."
Alexander Hauswald: "Not a friend."
Alexander Hauswald shrugs.
Whitney G. Elieen: "Through the power of God Nephi nothing is impossible."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Y'all don't look like no leper to me, sugercube."
Cassie-May O'Brien stared intensely at Wily.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Undead, though, eeyup."

Crystal Saint Claire: "Mortially challenged."
Wily Galen: "I prefer dead."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Potayto, potahto."
Wily Galen: "Five dollar words were never my strong suit."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Hands where Ah can see 'em."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "..."
"Let them deal with it."
Crystal Saint Claire: "It means you were bad at dying sir."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Whatever it is. Leper or no."
Wily Galen: "Or you'll fill me full of lead?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano pulls his hat down over his eyes.
Alexander Hauswald just sighs, facepalming.
Wily Galen: "On a train."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Please do not shoot him."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "What're you good at, mister Alexander?"
Wily Galen: "Right after I've had a pleasant conversation with Miss Crystal?"
Alexander Hauswald: "No, Sacks. Not until they do something dumb."
Crystal Saint Claire: "I would rather not bury anyone tonight."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Ain' one to make the first shot, stranger, but Ah know yer kind. Don'cha cause no trouble

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers steps forward and flashes her badge. "Teas Ranger. Ya got a good hold on that
manitou in yer head?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "And digging two holes is difficult at my size."
Wily Galen: "Wasn't planning on it."
"I was just catching a ride back to Kansas city."
Alexander Hauswald looks up at Nephi. "Shooting. Tracking. Treating animals. Know a thing or two about
occult things."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Ye better."
Cassie-May O'Brien nodded and sipped her coffee.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Oh! We're headed to Kansas City!"

"He has delivered unto us the gift of company."
Alexander Hauswald: "God's got better things to do."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Please stop launching about with threats. Be clear. Be concise."
Wily Galen: "Well, nice to meet you too Miss itchy trigger finger."
Crystal Saint Claire: Pauncing*
Whitney G. Elieen: "God always has time for his children." She says with a smile.
Wily Galen: "I'm gonna go take a nap, unless you want to have a jaw?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "Something like 'You will be shot if you become an issue's would suffice here."
Cassie-May O'Brien spat on the ground and moved her hand off her revolver.
Crystal Saint Claire: Issue's *
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers nods to the Harrowed. "Jus' know that if any trouble starts brewin' Ah'll be on

Cassie-May O'Brien: "Tha's whut Ah said."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Well, we three seem to be the only sane ones on the train right now."
Alexander Hauswald: "...Benefit of doubt, people."
"He didn't do nothing."
Crystal Saint Claire: "That is what you implied. Implications are for those unwilling to face the consequences of
following through on a proper threat, ma'am."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Jumpin at... First guy comes on smelling of cabbages and they all jump up and start

Alexander Hauswald shoots a dirty glare at Sacks."
Crystal Saint Claire: "That is what I was taught in Psychology, anyway."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Buncha wackos."
Cassie-May O'Brien sipped at her coffee.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Fahne, missus blabber. Ah don't trust ye, dead and walkin' stranger, so if y'all go 'round

Wily Galen draws his head back into the sleeper compartment nice and slow. He takes quiet steps over to
the bed and curls up on the edge of it. The two suitcases afford him little room, but he doesn't seem to
mind.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Wacko adventurer, a reb, and a scientist."
Crystal Saint Claire scribbles something in her small, leather bound journal.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano grumbles.

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: "Yeah, she's back with us."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Back wit' th' others."
Cassie-May O'Brien thumbed over her shoulder.
Alexander Hauswald: "...We're gonna get along fine.
Sacks likes most of you."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Well that's great to hear!"
"He's a good dog. Love dogs."
"Had a golden retriever back home."
"...What kinda breed is he? Sacks, I mean."
Crystal Saint Claire runs off to find Whitney for bedtime!
Crystal Saint Claire knocks on the for to the compartment.
Whitney G. Elieen goes to open the door
Whitney G. Elieen: "Crystal...welcome sister!"
Alexander Hauswald shrugs. "No idea. Probably a mongrel."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Tell me do you know the hour?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "Whitney!"
Alexander Hauswald: "...No, Sacks. Your word isn't good enough."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Well, Mongrel dogs are the really smart ones, y'know."
Crystal Saint Claire hugs Whitney. She reaches MAYBE the larger woman's hip.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Nick your wallet while you're sleeping, they will."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Is it bedtime yet?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Go on a vacation to Miami."
Alexander Hauswald: "Not this one. Used to be dumber than a sack of hammers."
Whitney G. Elieen returns the hug with as much strength as she could without crushing the poor young
girl.
Whitney G. Elieen: "Right you are! Tomorrow we shall arise bright and early."
"I enjoy my mornings with you very much after all."
Crystal Saint Claire nods.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "We gotta be in Kansas by now anyways."
Alexander Hauswald: "We got a day or two."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Tell me then. Are you ready to go to bed now? And have you had a chance to say hello to
our new friend?"
Cassie-May O'Brien peeked her head into the compartment where the undead went to sleep in.
Alexander Hauswald: "I'll go sleep. Let's go, Sacks."
Wily Galen one arm is hanging off the bed. His bowler hat fell off during the transition from floor to bed.
Galen looks like a disheveled corpse. He is a disheveled corpse in most anyone's eyes.
Cassie-May O'Brien furrowed her brow and pulled back, leaning on the wall in the corridor, observing the
partially-opened door and sipping coffee from her mug in left hand, right hand resting on the grip of her
revolver.
Alexander Hauswald passes by Cassie, stopping briefly to look at the scene.
Wily Galen reaches one hand behind himself and scratches at the seat of his pants.
Alexander Hauswald: "If he wanted, he'd do something."
"No use eyeballing him."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers puts a hand on Cassie's shoulder. "Ah'll take second watch."
Wily Galen: "...You do know I can hear you assholes standing at my door, right?"
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: "Jus' doin' my job."
Wily Galen: "Can you close the door so it's harder to hear you badmouthing me?"
Cassie-May O'Brien nodded at Callie.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Ain' takin' no chances."
Alexander Hauswald: "...You sure, Sacks? Well, no use changing your mind."
the dog sits down next to this commotion, ever vigilant.
"Sacks said he'll take watch."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: "Look, Ah'm not biased against th' Harrowed. Ah've known a few who're great
Rangers. Jus'... the things in yer heads can be... unpredicatable... is all."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Yeah, yeah, ain' no use keepin' on runnin' yer mouths, y'all. Go change meh in two hours,

Alexander Hauswald just shrugs, going to find his own place to sleep in.
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers nods and goes to catch some sleep before her shift
Wily Galen turns over and rearranges himself on top of his bed.
Alexander Hauswald: (Also the dog is still sitting there. MENACINGLY)
Cassie-May O'Brien just stays there with her gun and coffee.

Wonderful Cowboy Land: The train to Kansas is rolling along smooth as silk across a long stretch of desert land.
Most everyone is in the seated portion of the train. Reginald is in his cabin snoozing still. The vitally challenged
fella, Galen, is still sleeping like the dead in his cabin.
(I shall be off for a bit. Feel free to do things in the mean time.)
Whitney G. Elieen has her head bowed low. Perhaps in prayer. Perhaps in rest. Try as she might poor
Crystal was squeezed in a little tight.
Poage seemed satisfied, asleep in Whitney's bed. She slept the kind of sleep one experiences after a long

Alexander Hauswald is tending to Sacks, his face filled with gruffness as he tries to readjust the canine's
collar.

But y'all don't care about that flummery. S'just sleeptalkin'!
Alexander Hauswald: (Oh my gosh you gave Sacks his own icon)
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The train goes over a fair to middling size bump in the tracks. It disturbs stomachs and
some small mugs of coffee. Sacks crawls out from under the table where he was resting and begins to stretch.
Alexander Hauswald absentmindedly pets him, lost in thought.
Sacks does a big doggie yawn that ends with him smacking his lips.
Sacks: [Traps are gay]
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Sacks barks something that Alexander can't quite interpret. Doggo probably wants

Alexander Hauswald: "No money to burn. Still need to buy Sacks his lunch."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "I got..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano reaches into a belt pouch right in front of another kind of package and pulls out
a thick wad of cash and some coins.
Sacks looks at Alexander with his best puppy dog eyes at the mention of lunch.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...About... $80 union, and..."
"Some Reb odds and ends."
Alexander Hauswald: "Think they'll take union cash here."
Alexander Hauswald turns to Sacks.
Alexander Hauswald: "You just had breakfast."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Probably not."
(From dimVitrarius): , is it next day?
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "But there'll probably be a bank that'll do exchanges."
(From dimVitrarius): It means that Cassie had to sleep, yes?
(To dimVitrarius): After you picked up Alexander and the walking stiff? Yes.
(To dimVitrarius): Also yes.
(From dimVitrarius): I think we should make the nightmares roll, then! ..and sort out the Fate Chips.
Alexander Hauswald: "Probably. Heard from someone gold's worth the same everywhere."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Why I keep most of the rest in coins."
"Gold's gold."
"Course, Ghost Rock's worth more these days. Way more."
Alexander Hauswald: "Ghost Rock's bad."
"Sacks doesn't like it."
(To dimVitrarius): Alrighty roo. Make the nightmare roll and we'll sort out fate chips after we resolve that.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "What's the problem with Ghost Rock? It's just really good coal."
Alexander Hauswald: "Not according to Sacks."
Alexander Hauswald idly pets the dog.
Alexander Hauswald: "No idea what it is, but it's bad."
(To dimVitrarius): You can roll it in the main chat or gmroll it. Your pick.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "He's just a silly ol'dog, that's what he is."
Sacks doesn't even bother growling. He just gives Nephi a long, disapproving look.

Wonderful Cowboy Land: The back door of the train shudders open and a familiar face appears. The Conductor
shoves a rattling metal trolley through the door. It jounces a little on the door jamb, but the covered plate and the
large pitcher of coffee stay relatively still.

Cassie-May O'Brien: "Coffee!"
Alexander Hauswald: "...Guess it's coming to us."
Cassie-May O'Brien quickly downed remaining half of her mug and extended the empty container to the
Conductor.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Fill meh up, sugercube."
Conductor: "Look, I don't have anything else to do but make you guys as comfortable as possible."
Alexander Hauswald: "
"...Drive the train?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "The train goes back, and forth, and sometimes it changes tracks."
Conductor squeezes around the trolley, grabbing the coffee pitcher as he does. He obliges Cassie and
fills her mug back up full of steamy black goodness.
Whitney G. Elieen: " The lord has delivered unto us a bounty it seems."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Really, if it needs to stop suddenly, that is what the conductor is for, no?"
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Ohh, yer a godsend. If y'all say yer got some breakfast on this trolley here..."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Is there anything sweet?"
Conductor: "Eggs, bacon, toast, beans, ketchup, and salt."
"Think there might be a few toasted apples in there."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Gimme."
Alexander Hauswald: "How much is there?"
Cassie-May O'Brien took a seat with a grin.
Whitney G. Elieen: "Beans and water will do just fine for me."
Conductor: "I hope it's enough for all of you."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Ah'm takin' full course. Girl's gotta eat!"
Conductor takes a few plates out from under the cart and begins distributing the food accordingly.
Alexander Hauswald: "Toast and eggs. Sacks'll have beans and bacon."
Alexander Hauswald glares at the dog.
Conductor: "One of these days I'm going to get some help."
Alexander Hauswald: "No, I'm not going to ask if the beans are organic."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Yer whut."

Alexander Hauswald: "I don't know."
"But Sacks wants it."
Conductor: "That's the dog right?"
Alexander Hauswald nods.
Alexander Hauswald: "He's a picky eater."
Conductor grabs the plates and walks up the length of the train car, doling out the ordered food and drink.
Cassie-May O'Brien rolled her eyes with mouth full of beans and bacon and eggs.
Crystal Saint Claire takes toast and beans and ketchup and a toasted apple!
Alexander Hauswald sets Sacks' plate next to him, and starts eating his own.
Sacks sniffs curiously at his plate. Before starting to nibble at the bacon.
Conductor walks up to Crystal and gives her a plate. Then he hands Whitney a plate full of beans
accompanied by a cool, clear glass of water.
Whitney G. Elieen takes a simple bowl of beans and water herself
Conductor: "Mind if I squeeze past you two?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano also got breakfast and is having plenty of munch along the way

Cassie-May O'Brien: "Nephi, y'all fergive meh or nawt?"
Crystal Saint Claire wriggles back past Whitney with her food
Conductor: "Thanks, there might be a rough patch coming up soon."
Crystal Saint Claire eats methodically, a small spoonful of beans being placed on a small bite of toast.
Crystal Saint Claire: The apple is being saved for last.
Whitney G. Elieen eats her simple meal as slowly as she could. A few bites of beans followed by a sip of
water.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Yeah, yeah. I fergive ya."
Conductor: "Don't know if they cleared out the riff raff that was hanging around here last time I came through."
Crystal Saint Claire also tries to drink as much water as she can! Hydration is important!

coffee, and stood up to retrieve her stuff.

Moondew claims the GM spot because Doc is gone
Wonderful Cowboy Land slaps Moon's shit.
Moondew dies
Nevermore: Alright fellas
Crystal Saint Claire: ?
Nevermore: I'm working with Doc on a new initiative system since the one the game comes with is slow as
molasses.
Crystal Saint Claire: ok
Nevermore: This is mostly for Varmus' benefit, really, as he's the only one who knows how slow it can be.
So, currently, we've worked out that when rolling for initiative you roll your Quickness stat normally. This
determines when you can take your first action. You get a number of actions equivalent to your Quickness dice or
5, whichever is lower.
You can take your actions whenever after your initiative order has come up. They're marked with dots on your
token.
Crystal Saint Claire: ok
Nevermore: If you don't use em you lose em. If you get max on all your dice, you get to draw a fate chip.
Initiative is rerolled every round.
Crystal Saint Claire: ok
Cassie-May O'Brien: We need to get a call who is going.
Or it's gonna be chaos.
Crystal Saint Claire: ?
oh, an initiative tracker?
Nevermore: You gotta call out when you're going to take an action.
Cassie-May O'Brien: But yes, initiative tracker for the Quickness rolls.

Moondew: >inb4 everyone calls an action at once
Nevermore: And if you roll all 1's on your initiative, you lose two actions and Doc gets to draw a fate chip.
Alexander Hauswald: ((Wouldn't it be easier to just roll Quickness?))
Cassie-May O'Brien: It would be.
But having multiple actions is kinda a big thing in Deadlands.
Nevermore: You can get way more or less than two actions.
Cassie-May O'Brien: If two or more want to act at once, the one with higher Quickness roll this round acts first.
Fair?
Nevermore: Fair.
Alexander Hauswald: Aye aye.
Nevermore: Having multiple actions is also important for movement.
You can move and shoot in the same action.
It gets very complicated.
Cassie-May O'Brien: Let's have this explain itself in the game.
For now... let's draw fate chips?
Wonderful Cowboy Land: As soon as I get through putting all of them in a deck.
Cassie-May O'Brien: ah.
Crystal Saint Claire: oh dear.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: It will take me a bit.
Crystal Saint Claire: Can we help?

Crystal Saint Claire is busy loading bullets into her gun one at a time, very carefully.
Crystal Saint Claire has CLEARLY never been in an actualy gunfight before.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Ey, Crystal?"
"Remember to take cover."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: "Make sure yer not loadin' those bullets in backwards."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Lookie-look, sunshine's awake!"
Crystal Saint Claire: "The flat end goes towards me, right?"
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Eeeyup."
Whitney G. Elieen: "The Lord is with you Crystal...and so am I."
Crystal Saint Claire: "If the Lord gives us cover we should hide in it."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Good thinkin'."
Alexander Hauswald: "Lord could give us more than cover."
Crystal Saint Claire: "The main issue here is that we do not know where these train robbers will approach from,
and therefore cannot set up our defense appropriately."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Almost done.
Crystal Saint Claire: Yay!
"Oh!"
Crystal Saint Claire remembers something!
Whitney G. Elieen: "Hmmmm?"
"What is it?"
dimVitrarius: Moondew, we can expect robbers and rabble-rousers and other riveting rapscallions to try to ravage
our ride.
Crystal Saint Claire: "We need to warn Mr. Garen about the oncoming hostilities!"
Alexander Hauswald: "I doubt he cares."
dimVitrarius: You wanna make sure Callie is in position to defend it instead of sitting around and sniffing her ass.
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: Roger
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers positions herself to be able to look out the window for approaching hostiles
Crystal Saint Claire hides under a table
Crystal Saint Claire then decides to just move over and sit against the wall.
Whitney G. Elieen stands tall in front of Crystal. Clutching her hands as she does so.
Crystal Saint Claire takes a deep breath in, then lets it out slowly.

Wonderful Cowboy Land: You tap the massive bandit on the head with the metal rod. It would be nothing coming
from someone smaller and less coated down with muscle, but from Whitney... It knocks him out and stops just shy
of caving his skull in.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Nice work!"
Conductor pokes his head out. He has a scrap of his shirt pressed to his hear. The scrap is soaked
through with blood.
Whitney G. Elieen: "It was not my work that felled him..."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano: That's a pass.

Crystal Saint Claire holds out her pistol.
Alexander Hauswald: "...Whitney, was it?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "Yes...yes Whitney."
"Whitney Gould Elieen"
Alexander Hauswald: "Good job."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Here. If he gets out of the cuffs just shoot him. It's set to shotgun right now, at this range
the armor will be insufficient."
Alexander Hauswald: "Might want to stop his bleeding."
Cassie-May O'Brien holsters her rifle and begins to remove whatever armor Big Bawws is wearing.
Crystal Saint Claire starts dragging the pieces of armor up the train, towards the engine room.
Cassie-May O'Brien also removes his weapons.

Whitney G. Elieen leans down and inspects the wounds
Whitney G. Elieen: "The Lord works in mysterious ways...perhaps he may have use of him in his plan."
"Either way it is not up to me to decide"
Alexander Hauswald leans against the window, groaning loudly. "Let's try this again."
Alexander Hauswald: (Can I try and hex?)
Whitney G. Elieen: *Whatever those wounds may be she would reach her hand forward

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers moves to a seat and strikes a match to light a cigar. "All in a day's work."
Cassie-May O'Brien: regular shells yes? Not brennekas?
Alexander Hauswald: (Can I draw my cards or did I immediately get my magic boolits?)

Regular shells.
Gimmie a tick.
Crystal Saint Claire: Anything personalized about it?
A name, or an insigina, or a rubber duck
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Not the body armor.
Crystal Saint Claire: I took the helmet, if possible, as well.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: I think it's grafted onto his face.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The face plate might have had something on it, but that's a pile of scrap that's
distributed all over his head.
Crystal Saint Claire: I'm an engineer, I can fix this.
Granted, we'll need a doctor to separate it from his face
Cassie-May O'Brien straightens up, pocketing the shells and bullets, stuffing the Colt Navy in her belt
behind her back, and slinging the single-shot over her arm.

Doc (GM): Right.
NEV
Are you also here?
Wonderful Cowboy Land: I don't think he here right now.
Let's see...
Alexander is up. Something feels off. There is no light coming in through the window shutters in his room above
the saloon proper. More than one someone is downstairs making noise. Perhaps, it would be a good idea to
investigate.
Alexander Hauswald: "..."
"Sacks. Wake up."
Sacks: "Rrrruff?"
Alexander Hauswald: "Yes, I'm playing hero again. Let's go.
Alexander Hauswald slides into his boots- thankfully, he only has one sets- and grabs his gun, walking
down with the sixshooter ready.\
Sacks follows after him.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Alexander squeaks down the stairs and comes upon a mostly dark bar. There is one
lighted table. Three figures are clustered around it. The Bartender from last night is one of them. The other two are
harder to recognize. There is an open seat.
Alexander Hauswald: "..."
Alexander Hauswald slowly holsters his gun, squinting.
Alexander Hauswald: "...I don't trust this either, Sacks."
Alexander Hauswald walks closer, sighing before he sits down at the open spot.
Alexander Hauswald: "What's going on?"
Bartender perks up from where he is hunched over a pair of cards.
Bartender: "Ah, one of the new fellas."
Alexander Hauswald: "That I am. Can't seem to sleep."
Alexander Hauswald idly pets Sacks.
Bartender: "Take a seat and play a while."
Alexander Hauswald: "What're we playing?"
Gun Runner: "Hold 'Em ese."
"The mustachioed bastard keeps clearing me out."
Alexander Hauswald: "Well."
General Store Owner: "You know how to play?"
Alexander Hauswald adjusts in his seat.

Alexander Hauswald: "I know the basics."
Bartender: "Alright then, I'll deal you in."
Alexander Hauswald: "Go ahead."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: (Be back inna tick)
(Alroight)
Bartender slides a twenty five cent coin across the table.
General Store Owner: "Call."
General Store Owner slides his own coin to the center of the table.
Gun Runner: "Aye aye, call."
Gun Runner flicks a quarter into the pot.
Alexander Hauswald slides his own coin.
Alexander Hauswald: "Call."
Bartender: Make a faith check for me.
Alexander Hauswald: ((I got no faith.))
Bartender slides out three cards from the deck and places them face up near the pot.
Bartender: (Spirit check)

Gun Runner face seems to flicker for a moment, becoming less distinct. The effect lasts only an instant
though, and you can't be sure it was any more than your eyes going of of focus.
Nevermore: I'm here now, there was some shenanigans going on.
Alexander Hauswald remains silent, his free hand resting on his lap.
Bartender: "Next round of bets."
Bartender puts a quarter into the pot.
General Store Owner: "Think I'll up the ante a lil."
General Store Owner slides a big, shiny half dollar across the table and into the pile of coins.
Gun Runner: "Son of a bitch, you're going to bleed me dry."
Gun Runner slides a half dollar into the pot.
Bartender: "He can do it if he's got the cards to back it up."
Bartender puts another quarter in the growing mass of coinage.
Alexander Hauswald slides his own fifty cents in, his face sealed.
Bartender: Same check.

Gun Runner hat seems to change shape for a second. It becomes smaller and more weathered. Then he
reaches up and adjusts it. Still a sombrero.
Alexander Hauswald: "...Nice hat."
General Store Owner face becomes a little more lined and aquiline. He reaches up and smooths it out in a
moment.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano eventually comes down the stairs to the main floor, looking groggy as anything.
Gun Runner: "Thanks ese, is that one of your friends?"
"One that looks like chewed shit?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Mmmister Alex?"
Alexander Hauswald: "Yes."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks around the room.
Alexander Hauswald turns towards Nephi.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "You folks playin cards?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano rubs his eyes.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "I just came down to see if I couldn't find a nice tall glass o'water."
General Store Owner: "We are boy, care to join us?"
Alexander Hauswald: ((Here I expected a "Why are you sitting alone"))
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Well, why not. I'm mighty tired, though."
"Might be..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is interrupted by a yawn.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Crawlin back into bed after a few hands."
Bartender: "I'll get you a nice cool soda if you steal the pot from me next hand."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Oh yer on."
Bartender: "We'll finish this one up, then deal you in."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano pops a seat next to Alex.
Bartender: "Next to last round."
"Thrown down your money."

Bartender puts a twenty five cent piece in the pot.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano reaches into a belt pouch in front of his other package and pulls out a sack filled
with coins.
General Store Owner scratches his cheek for a couple of seconds before doing the same.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Usually don't like playin for cash. God says it's a sin, but everybody's gotta do
somethin to pass the time."
Gun Runner: "I don't think you two gringos have any damn tells."
Gun Runner tosses a quarter into the pile of coins.
Alexander Hauswald: "Call and raise."
Alexander Hauswald throws fifty cents in.
Bartender: "Brave fella."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The other players slide in another quarter to match.
Bartender: "Last round."
"Make your plays."

Bartender has something stretching out behind his head, like tree branches, but after a blink the figment
of Nephi's imagination is gone.
General Store Owner: "So, Mister Alex, you got any family?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "..."
"I uh... I'll be back soon."
(Time for me to go arrived sooner than I expected. Going to see Kingsman, probably.)
Bartender: "See you later cowpoke."
Alexander Hauswald: ((Am I seeing the same?))
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks to Alex warily, unsettled a little bit.
Alexander Hauswald: "...Big brother. Nobody else."
Bartender: (A little bit, but less than Nephi.)
(More like dots swimming through Alex's vision.)
Bartender knocks on the table.
Bartender: "Check."
General Store Owner: "Check..."
Gun Runner: "I don't trust you."
"Check."
Alexander Hauswald closes his eyes.
General Store Owner: "Interesting, your big brother doing alright then?"
Alexander Hauswald: "Not really. Gone missing."
"Check."

(From left to right: Bartender, General Store Manager, and Gun Runner.)
Bartender: "Looks like you're splitting the pot with me."
Alexander Hauswald: "Works fine for me."
Gun Runner: (He's actually splitting it with the Gun Runner, who can replicate his hand, since he has the Joker.)
Alexander Hauswald: (Hum.)
(That's... a dollar lost?)
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The bald man with the mustache and the Gun Runner halve the pot and take their cut.
Go with that for now.
Alexander Hauswald: "Thank you for the game."
Alexander Hauswald eyes them suspiciously.
Bartender: "You staying for another hand?"
Alexander Hauswald: "...One more hand."

H in the middle of it.

Doc (GM): Accidentally backed out of the game, gimmie a tick.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Alexander, these fellas are not what they seem.
You blink, and then you see them.
One man in a red suit with a cow's skull for a mask. The antlers stretching up into the blackness surrounding the
table. You think the bartender was sitting there. Where the General Store Manager was, there is now a white
boned skeleton wearing a red jacket. The bones gives a happy little wave. The Gun Runner has been replaced by
something...wrong. You can't see its face. When your eyes try to tell your brain what they see, the signal gets
garbled and broken. All you can tell is that he is wearing a battered Stetson and red stained riding duds.
???: "My my..."
Alexander Hauswald: "...Game's up, folks."

There is, however, a sizable pile of money, and that odd card.
Alexander Hauswald: "..."
Alexander Hauswald checks the card, first. It seemed valuable enough for the players to be surprised by.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Holy shit.
That's one of Hoyle's cards.
Alexander Hauswald: "...Well now."
Alexander Hauswald quickly stashes in in his pocket, before looking at the money.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The money looks, a bit different in this light.
The coins are all from various ages, some look older, some look newer. Some gleam with a hint of gold in them.
Some are made from some metal that you don't know of.
All of them are, assumedly, valuable.
Best to take them all and sort through them at a later date.
Alexander Hauswald: "..."
Alexander Hauswald sweeps them all into his pocket. Better do this after he slept.
Alexander Hauswald: "..Wouldn't believe it either, Sacks. Wouldn't believe it either."

Cassie-May O'Brien was sitting at one of the tables, a mug of steaming coffee and a glass of whiskey that
might have had ice inside once sitting beside her heavy riding boots, perched on the wooden surface.
Alexander Hauswald climbs down, groggy, followed by that damn mutt of his. He looks around, yawning,
before taking something out- you can't make it from here- out of his shirt pocket, examine it intently,
before walking down.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Howdy, pardnah! Slept well?"

Alexander Hauswald: "And hexslinging has to be taught by a person, not a book."
"When you hex, you let a manitou in your body."
"And then you do a little fight with it in your head. It can be anything. My teacher used chess, I use poker."
"And if you win, it has to do what you tell it to and scram."
"Sometimes it wins. Sometimes it has room to punch you on the way out."
Alexander Hauswald points at Sacks.
Alexander Hauswald: "My familiar. Longer than just a hex, but he's as smart as us now."
Alexander Hauswald moves his eyes to Sacks, sighing.
Alexander Hauswald: "Yes, Sacks, that includes Nephi."
Crystal Saint Claire: "...So"
"What if one is not Hexing"
"Do manitous often communicate with the living?"
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Woulda explain mah dreams."
Alexander Hauswald: "I think they can."
Alexander Hauswald looks around and pulls out a playing card.
Alexander Hauswald: "Got this last night from playing against them."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Interesting!"
"...so are they evil?"
Alexander Hauswald: "..."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Eeeeeyup."
Alexander Hauswald shrugs.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Them's evil."
Alexander Hauswald: "No more than humans."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "More than humans.'
Alexander Hauswald: "You'll be surprised."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Nah Ah wouldn'."
Alexander Hauswald sips his """Coffee"""" calmly.
Alexander Hauswald: "I cheat them for magic. I'd know."

Crystal Saint Claire: "I would imagine there are outliers on either side."
Alexander Hauswald: "Bah. I met nice ones. I met rude ones. They're all the same."
Cassie-May O'Brien switched to whiskey.
Crystal Saint Claire: "So... there are some people who claim the ideas of... inventors, such as myself, are often
influenced by such beings. So I was considering an experiment."
"But for it to work, I'd need to speak to at least one Manitou, in person or through a go-between somehow."
Alexander Hauswald: "...Bad idea."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Real bad idea."
Alexander Hauswald: "....Sacks says it's a bad idea too."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Why?"
"According to mythos, manitous can be cheated. That means they follow rules, for the most part, no?"
Alexander Hauswald: "It's risky. You could die
. Or worse."
Crystal Saint Claire: "If I die, I will be consigned to oblivion. Whitney told me so."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "If yew die, yer soul gonne be captured by them an' tortured fer eternity in their home."
"Believe meh, Ah know sumthin' 'bout it."
Cassie-May O'Brien shuddered, downed her whiskey in one shot, and chased with a huge gulp of coffe.
Crystal Saint Claire: "...Hauswald, you've spoken with a manitou, have you not?"
"Perhaps you could help me!"
Alexander Hauswald: "I'd rather not, kid."
"I accepted these risks. You haven't."
Crystal Saint Claire: "I will accept any risk necessary to further humanity's progress."
Alexander Hauswald: "...You sure? Your life's ahead of you."
((Hang on, going mobile))
Crystal Saint Claire: "...I..."
Crystal Saint Claire looks down again.
Crystal Saint Claire: "I can do it. I know I can."
"All I need is an idea, just to prove that they can make them."
UrbanCritter: "... lright. I'll think about it. Tell me about this experiment of yours."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Well, sometimes inventors have odd ideas. Ideas that do not fall in line with their "usual"
vein of creations. For example, my Opus Magnum. I am, for the most part, an engineer. I focused mostly on
engines, and mechanical things."
"But one day the idea came to me almost out of nowhere. I was concerned for my safety, and about my skill
protecting myself"

UrbanCritter: "And you think the ghost shotgun is manitou work."
Crystal Saint Claire: "And the idea came to me to make a pistol from Ghost Iron. Easier for someone of my
stature and strength to use."
"I think that, if manitous are capable of such things, the Opus Magnum was their work."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...hum."
Cassie-May O'Brien crossed her arms.
Crystal Saint Claire: "My hands, their ideas. The blueprints were my own, the conceptualization, the craft..."
"But the spark, the idea... it was like lightning from a blue summer sky."
UrbanCritter: "... Interesting thought.
Crystal Saint Claire: "So... to test this..."
UrbanCritter: I'll have to find a Huckster, first."
Crystal Saint Claire: "I would make a list. Of ideas, as they came to me. And each one, regardless of content,
regardless of morality, would at least be written down."
UrbanCritter: "I can only call them to me for hexes. Can't just drop one to talk to you."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Pare out the most dangerous, and the blatantly unethical..."
"And then attempt to bring the rest to fruition."
"The key would be letting... someone... know I would be a blank slate for that period of time."
"That no idea would be shelved without inspection."
"An invitation, so to speak, to see what they could sneak into the world of the living."
UrbanCritter: "... If you think that'll work. But I don't think manitous do that."
"They come on their own terms. Or when challenged."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Then I will have disproved a theory, which is just as useful."
"Well, perhaps it could be worded as a challenge?"
"Perhaps not against me, I am... informidable."
"But could one, in theory, inspire competition?"
UrbanCritter: "... We'll have to find a huckster. Or a shaman. Or something."
Crystal Saint Claire: "They would know more, then?"
"I will ask about."
UrbanCritter: "I challenge manitous for a game to hex."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "You don't want a bloody shaman."
UrbanCritter looks at Cassie.
Crystal Saint Claire: "I do not believe we would find one this far from the Native lands."
Alexander Hauswald: "... We'll need a huckster, then. They're rare-ish."

Cassie-May O'Brien: (With Alex, Sacks and Crystal, at the hotel they stayed in, after morning coffee and in

(But with UrbanCritter gone, we might skip forward a bit and do something else.)
Crystal Saint Claire: (I am here)

Doc (GM): (Breakfast or a trip to the General store for supplies and other accouterments?)
Cassie-May O'Brien: (A trip would work better I think, since Alex would be present for the breakfast and it's sucky

Doc (GM): (Right.)
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The bell above the door makes a cling clang as Cassie and Crystal enter the general
store. The owner scrapes himself back to wakefulness in a few seconds. He glances to the two coming in the
entryway, then to the clock on the wall. He cracks his neck and smacks his lips before tipping his chair back to a
more comfy position. The store is filled with all manner of useful items, provisions, cheap guns, cheap bullets,
rope, shovels, axes, pickaxes, work clothes, slightly fancier work clothes, horse blankets, saddles, feed, and a
hundred other things.
Cassie-May O'Brien: (It is however half past midnight. So if we're doing something it's gonna happen now- oh

"Howdy, pardnah."
General Store Owner: "Howdy miss, if you're looking for anything specific, I can help. If you're browsing, then I
see no reason for me to interfere."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Whut wuz it y'all wanted ta check out, Crystal?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "...something resistant. Cloth of some sort."
"Something that would function well in a n armored vest..."
Cassie-May O'Brien just browses around for anything unusual and interesting, out of curiosity more than
need. Maybe a coffee maker she could use in the field comfortably? She was somewhat in a problem with

General Store Owner fishes a tin of indeterminate origin from a vest pocket. It is long and metal and the

General Store Owner: Crystal, there is a deck of cards tucked into the pocket of a plaid work shirt. It looks a little
bruised, but the seal is still intact.
Cassie, you locate a mesh strainer. The spacing on the mesh is perfect for coffee grounds. The only problem is,
the mesh looks to be about two foot but four foot. Unless you've got a big ass coffee cup this is going to be
useless. Might be able to modify it though...
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Hmm. Eeeyup."
Cassie-May O'Brien grabbed the strainer.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "How much fer tha'?"
General Store Owner is lighting up his fresh rolled cigarillo as Cassie asks him the question. He takes two
puffs and blows a ring of smoke before replying.
General Store Owner: "Half dollar for the gold sifter."

Crystal Saint Claire: *How big is the shirt? Could it be modified to fit Whitney?
"May I buy these?"
General Store Owner: Whitney is huge. The only thing you can make out of this shirt is something that will cover
her chest and most of the body above that. Significant, skillful alteration will be needed for even that.
"Sure kid. Twenty five for the deck and..."
General Store Owner examines the plaid on the shirt with obvious distaste.

General Store Owner: "Alright, thirty cent."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Fahne."
Cassie-May O'Brien paid up.
General Store Owner: "Should have some tents..."
General Store Owner takes the coinage from Cassie and stuffs it into the wooden drawer that serves as
the register.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Now, how ta make it inta proper coffee strainer..."
General Store Owner: "With the lanterns and lantern oil and spikes and rock salt bucks."
"Standard camping supplies."

Crystal Saint Claire: And a journal!
General Store Owner: The promised lanterns are there, as is all manner of oil. The spikes are in a bucket next to
a bunch of rubber mallets. Canvas tents are stacked against the wall. There's a couple boxes of what looks to be
specialty shotgun shells next to the tents.
Crystal Saint Claire takes a look!
Cassie-May O'Brien: )brb)
Crystal Saint Claire: "Sir, what are these?"
General Store Owner: "Wuss what?"
Crystal Saint Claire tries to bring him one of the boxes
General Store Owner: "Oh, them's rock salt shells."
"For scaring off prairie ticks and other nonsense you find out in th' wild."
Crystal Saint Claire: "..."
Crystal Saint Claire plunks two boxes on the counter
Crystal Saint Claire also gets a tent
General Store Owner looks over the boxes of shells and the tent for a few moments. His finger taps the
counter top with a rhythm that seems familiar, probably a song.
General Store Owner: "Howsabout, two dollars for the lot?"
(Note, you guys should be keeping track of your inventory and money exchanged.)
Crystal Saint Claire: (How many vests could I make from this tent?)
General Store Owner: (Depends on who you're making it for.)
(Might be able to get four for a regular sized fella.)
(Two, and maybe a third of a vest for someone of Whitney's size.)
Crystal Saint Claire: Hmm
So one for whitney

Crystal Saint Claire: plunk
Crystal Saint Claire plunks the tent on the counter.
Crystal Saint Claire: "And this..."
"Do you know where I could find someone skilled with gunsmithing?"

the man at the counter looks like Pancho Villa. What is not certain from the outside is the overpowering odor of
gunpowder, gun oil, and gun metal. It's like a goddam WALL when you open the door.

Gun Runner: "Keeps long time."
Crystal Saint Claire is, for a reminder, 15.
Cassie-May O'Brien decides to check if there's brennekas aka slugs for shotgun.
Gun Runner peers down at Crystal from his counter. It has several tiny Mexican flags sticking out of it.
The flagpoles are bullets.
Gun Runner: "As long as it is invisible."
"Or..."
"Not invisible."
"Si."
Crystal Saint Claire: "It is my bag."
Gun Runner: "Your bag is a gun?"
Crystal Saint Claire reaches into the bag really slowly.
Crystal Saint Claire: "No, the gun is..."
Gun Runner: Cassie.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Oh, here it is!"
Gun Runner: There are piles and piles of shells.
Some are in boxes of twenty.
Some are in a glass case with nameplates underneath them.
Cassie-May O'Brien checks if all of those are shot, or any slugs.
Gun Runner: There are a good many slugs amongst them.
Crystal Saint Claire slowly pulls out the gun.
Gun Runner: If you want to look for something specific, make a smarts roll.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Please be careful. It is not loaded, but one should treat guns like they're loaded unless
you're in a gunfight. Then you treat an empty gun like an empty gun."
Crystal Saint Claire looks at the bullets with nameplates!
Cassie-May O'Brien: Nah, just regular shotgun slugs instead of buckshot.
Cassie gathers up...

Cassie-May O'Brien: ...20 slugs.
Crystal Saint Claire: "I made it myself, and was wondering if a professional like you could give me any advice."
Cassie-May O'Brien: That should be $2, same as 20 shotshells, yes?
Gun Runner: Slugs are a little more specialty than regular shot, but here, two dollars should cover it.
"I will see what I can see."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Would Ah git a discount if Ah traded yew sum' of mah buckshot shells fer those?"

Gun Runner: "Forty shells of what gauge?"
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Twelvers."
Cassie-May O'Brien pat-patted her double-barrel.
Gun Runner takes the gun from Crystal as he talks to Cassie. He gives it the hairy eyeball from every
angle, pops the cylinder out, touches the metal to his tongue, and hefts it in his palm.
Gun Runner: "Can give you two dollar fifty cent in credit."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "How 'bout we jus' trade forty shotshells fer twenny slugs? Think yer makin' a profit there
anyway."
Crystal Saint Claire: "You should not lick that, sir"
Gun Runner shuffles around behind the counter for a minute before emerging with a box of bullets. He
loads up the cylinder of Crystal's revolver in about ten seconds.
Gun Runner: "Fine with me compadre."
"Keep head away from target for couple of seconds."
Cassie-May O'Brien nods.
Cassie-May O'Brien:

Cassie-May O'Brien removes 40 shotshells and adds 20 slug shells
Gun Runner holds the pistol up and fires it across the room at a set of metal targets. Behind the targets
are sandbags. Behind the sandbags is a thick oak wall.

Gun Runner: There's a few named after peppers. Jalepeno, Habenro, and Ghost. A couple for really huge guns.
There is also one called, "Tequila Special."

light shining through the windows, but not much. Walking through the door sets off a jingling bell mounted above it.
The tall, lanky store owner turns from where he is examining his stock to face the newcomers. He holds a lit
lantern in one hand and a pad of paper in the other. The pad is covered with neat handwriting. He holds the
lantern up and squints for a second before recognition dawns.
General Store Owner: "What are you doing back so late kid?"
"And with, new friends."

Crystal Saint Claire: "That sounds silly."
Whitney G. Elieen: "The great controversy...the battle between good and evil."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Oh."
"That sounds ominous."
Whitney G. Elieen: "The seemingly endless struggle between the Lord and the deceiver."
??: "It does sound silly, but it is an explanation of something."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Yes."
"It is not provable, but it is an attempt."
Whitney G. Elieen: "This is a sign. A sign of the end."
Whitney G. Elieen clutches her chest
Crystal Saint Claire: "Whitney? Are you okay?"
Crystal Saint Claire clings to Whitney
??: "It might be, but the end is never the end is never the end."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Wait, that is oddly worded..."

Whitney G. Elieen: "Lord...lord above I am sorry to have ever doubted you...the end times are coming."
Crystal Saint Claire: "...will it be us?"
"I hope it is us, if evil is winning right now."

Whitney G. Elieen: "Your arrival is soon...but what comes before...God protect us."

Whitney G. Elieen takes a deep breath
??: "It could be you this time."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Whitney, we can help people!"
??: "Or it could be a cosmic rule that stops it."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Cosmic... rule?"
??: "There's rules that God abides by."
"He has his own set of commandments to follow, like the rest of us."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Who would enforce them?"

Crystal Saint Claire: "Against... himself?"
??: "Because if he didn't do as the definition of himself does, he would no longer be himself, now would he?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "...that is a good point."
Whitney G. Elieen: "He did once before...when he sent his son to die on our behalf."
"The ultimate enforcement of the rules he set."
Crystal Saint Claire: "A door that does not open is a wall."
??: "Or it could lack a doorknob."
"Or be locked."
Whitney G. Elieen: "For he is a just God but also a god of mercy."
??: "Or any number of other things."
"It's never just one thing."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Right. But a door that does not open, functionally speaking, is just a worse version of a
wall."
??: "Maybe, or it could be better version. Since it's easier to get through."
"It all depends on perspective."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Correct"
??: "It is getting a bit late."
"Do either of you have any other questions right now?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "How can I find Manitou?"
??: "Ask your friend Alexander."
"He knows how to call one up safely."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Will we still be allowed to buy things from you?"
??: "Well, that's a relative term when you're dealing with angry spirits."
"Of course, I'm here to ease pain as best I can."
Crystal Saint Claire: "And..."
??: "To help the weary and the burdened."
Crystal Saint Claire: "This will be my last question, I promise..."
"Is there any way to communicate with manitou without angering them? Simple conversation, rather than
competition or bargaining?"
(I gtg soon too.)
??: "I'm afraid not. You've always got to offer some sort of challenge to them. Though it can be presented in lots
and lots of different ways."
Whitney G. Elieen: "...I have no questions. For if this is a sign from God than it is already the answer to the
question I never thought to ask till now."

And I have arranged for several surprises.
Kansas city is pretty nice, all things considered. There's good drink, good food, and good company, if you take my
meaning. There is business to attend to though, and after a day to rest from travels, everyone bands together to
head to the main Marshalry Offices.
Alexander Hauswald is waiting, a stoic expression on his face. Sacks is by his side.
Sacks idly scratches his ear.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks terribly excited
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "All that travelin' and we're finally here."

"Brown rain."
"Think it mighta had something to do with some old beans."
Alexander Hauswald: "...Went too well."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...What's that supposed to mean?"
Cassie-May O'Brien looked somewhat grouchy. Perhaps the reason was her not drinking coffee at the

Alexander Hauswald: "...Very long story."
Alexander Hauswald looks around, and examines something in his pocket.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Maybe we can play some time! I learned from Mr. Bean at the general store!"
"I should play with more people to improve..."
Alexander Hauswald: "...Mr. Bean?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "He owns the store."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Mr. Bean?"
Alexander Hauswald: "...Think I played with him."

Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit walks along behind the larger bandit with his colt's stock at his shoulder.
Crystal Saint Claire moves back to talk with the two of them.
Crystal Saint Claire: "So."
"Should I go over the general plan again?"
Alexander Hauswald: "...Guess that's nobody."
Big Bawss Bandit stares at Crystal with his one...sort of good eye. It is hard to tell the quality of it since it

"Take em to a banker, maybe?"
"They got a bank in town, I bet."

Alexander Hauswald: "Why do you-"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "I don't think she's ever had a friend before" He whispers.
Alexander Hauswald looks at Nephi.
Alexander Hauswald rolls his eyes
Crystal Saint Claire: "That means he knows how bandits think, how they work. That makes him an asset, if he is
willing to work with us, and provides him a source of income he can use to provide for his family without resorting

Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit smells like peppermint, for some reason.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: What's the protocol for entering the office of a bunch of lawmen, and women, again?

Secretary stands up straight again and walks over to her desk to fiddle with the drawers.
UrbanCritter: "Course he does."
Crystal Saint Claire has not looked up from her writing, and only moves if it is obvious the Secretary

Secretary: "I keep up with the scientific community as one of my hobbies, and I heard about an exceptional young
graduate from MIT."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Oh, you have interests in science?"
Crystal Saint Claire perks up a little.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Any fields in particular?"
Secretary pulls out a small, round, corn bread looking ball. She takes a sniff of it and looks satisfied.
Crystal Saint Claire looks at the ball.
Crystal Saint Claire: "What is that?"
Secretary: "I have a degree in Civil Engineering, but Physics has always been my favorite subject."
"Oh, this?"
"It's a hush puppy."
Sacks perks up at the word "puppy".
Crystal Saint Claire: "...do you have more food in here?"
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers 's eyes start to glaze over until she hears the words 'hush puppy."
Crystal Saint Claire: "If so, may I have some? I... slept through breakfast this morning."
Secretary: "Of course."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: "...Y'all got hush puppies?"
Secretary: "On both counts."
"...on all counts."
Crystal Saint Claire makes a note in her book: "Snack bag"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano rubs his temples.
Alexander Hauswald: "I'm not hungry. Sacks is, though."
Secretary clicks back over to Alex and Sacks. She bends down and offers the hush puppy to the little dog.
Crystal Saint Claire: "We should get back to doing things."
"Why specifically us, I believe we were asking?"
"I understand them... But adding in myself, I cannot see us as a "Posse," so to speak."
Overmarshal Fossifer: "Each for different reasons."
Sacks gently grabs it with his teeth, putting it on the ground, and licking the nice lady.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "List 'em?"
Sacks then starts eating.
Overmarshal Fossifer: "But all, because it seemed to me you are all concerned with doing good."

(From Crystal Saint Claire): is the Hushpuppy gonna be magic, and make Sacks not able to talk for a bit?
(From Crystal Saint Claire): because that would be pretty good.
(To Poage): I mean, it's going to take him a while to chew. So yes.
Alexander Hauswald: "Strange, though."
"We're not the best out there."
"I know I'm not."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Of course not. The best are likely overpriced."
"Or on the 'other teams' as it were."
Overmarshal Fossifer: "Best?"
"Concern with..."
Overmarshal Fossifer rubs two fingers and a thumb together in the age old gesture of, "Munnay."
Alexander Hauswald: "Fair enough."
Overmarshal Fossifer: "Don't need folk too concerned wit greenbacks."
"Need folk concerned wit helping."
"That don't mean I ain't gonna pay you."
"Just gotta have..."
Overmarshal Fossifer runs his fingers over the oiled cylinder of the gun on his desk as he searches for a
word.
Overmarshal Fossifer: "Right pri-or-ee-tee."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Huh."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: "Ah mean, ah'd rather help people than jus' be greedy."

Sacks: Aaaaalright.
Then I'll head to bed. Just assume Alexander stood there stoically like he always does.
Overmarshal Fossifer: Roger.
CONTINUING ON.
"Good, good, will ask Miss Whitney later."
"Tell her come over when she gets chance."
Crystal Saint Claire: "I will."
Overmarshal Fossifer scoots his chair back from his desk and walks over to the desk Cassie is sitting at.
His coat has a lot of tassels with bright orange and yellow beads. The tassels click together as he walks
with a pleasant sussuration.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Also, I have questions regarding... these two."
Crystal Saint Claire points to Bawws and Junior.
Overmarshal Fossifer jimmies one of the larger drawers open and pulls out a small leather bound book.
Some of the pages are a little yellow.
Overmarshal Fossifer: "Mmmm..."
Crystal Saint Claire: "The main question being, may I deputize the larger one?"
Overmarshal Fossifer: "No."
"Taking him in."
Crystal Saint Claire sighs.
Crystal Saint Claire: "What are your plans for him?"
Overmarshal Fossifer: "Stand trial."
"Or..."
Overmarshal Fossifer tucks the books under his arm and walks forward to look at Big.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Is there anything I could do to convince whomever will be handing out the verdict that he is
potentially a valuable asset to the law, and a victim of circumstance?"
Overmarshal Fossifer doesn't say anything, he puts a hand on Big's neck and feels around for something.
His hand pauses over a certain spot his neck. Fossifer's index finger taps something, then traces around
Big's neck to his eye.
Overmarshal Fossifer: "Hmmm..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: I'm back. Has the mission begun yet?
Crystal Saint Claire: (Not yet)
"I was wondering... about that."

"He can help."
"No trial, for now."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Help how?"
Overmarshal Fossifer: "Tell where he got eye, maybe something else."
"Be safe with me."
Big Bawss Bandit reaches up and moves the Marshall's hand away from his face.
Crystal Saint Claire walks up to BB.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Do these terms sound agreeable?"
Big Bawss Bandit turns and looks to Junior for a moment. The smaller bandage covered individual nods
and pats Big on the leg with affectionate reassurance. Big turns back around and nods.
Big Bawss Bandit: "I'll help."
Overmarshal Fossifer: "Good."
Overmarshal Fossifer walks back over to his desk and pulls out a small box. The box jingles as he places
it on the level wood plain of the desk.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Then I will agree to the terms of employment as well."
Overmarshal Fossifer sets the journal down on the desk with one hand while he opens the box. He takes
out a small stack of money, thinks for a moment, then puts another stack on top of it.
Overmarshal Fossifer closes up the box and chucks it back under his desk.
Overmarshal Fossifer: "Hundred dollars for supplies and horses, fifty for the notorious Big Bawws, and record of
cases Billy was working on."
Crystal Saint Claire takes the record.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Thank you."
Overmarshal Fossifer: "Thank you."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The record has a few places marked in it.

The missing marshal's name is Billy.
It has been a long day Cassie. You've been trying to watch our for everyone and make sure the small bandit still
with you doesn't get up to any funny business. The only thing that seems to hold his interest for longer than two
seconds is peppermint sticks, shooting, and Whitney. Not sure if the little fella is actually interested in her sermons
or the...holy sacraments inside her dress. Not too bad really, or at least no worse than Nephi. The big fella got
dropped off at the marshal's office, so he's out of your hair now. Time to lay down and, sleep.
Cassie-May O'Brien was NOT happy about the sleeping part. She avoided sleep as long as she could, but
she realized her body needed the rest. It's a shame it was no rest for her mind and poor soul.

Wonderful Cowboy Land: The harder you listen the more you feel like something is tugging at your chest.
Cassie-May O'Brien weakly pawed at her chest in her sleep.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: There's something there.
An old hand, weathered by work, time, and sun.
A familiar hand.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "N-no..."

Some warmer than others.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Whuu..."
Cassie-May O'Brien turned her head in her sleep, trying to see with closed eyes.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The hand is there. You can see a brown palm. The palm shares your mark. It brushes
against the discs. They shine with a wan luminescence. There are five ones that shine white. Five that shine red.
One that shines blue.
Cassie-May O'Brien tries to grab the palm!
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Cassie's hand wraps around the palm.
You can feel the tugging get stronger, pulling at your chest even harder than before, but there is no resolution, not
yet. The palm is cold. Perhaps it could use, a little warming up?
Cassie-May O'Brien put her other hand on the unfamiliar-yet-famliar palm and ran her fingers over it in
confusion. She has always had warm hands.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Her other hand makes the palm no warmer. It bend down and brushes against the
gently glowing discs.

Cassie-May O'Brien let go with one hand, and extended it to the discs. What were those...? That hand
seemed to... want them? Should she give one up...?
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The fingers of the palm point to two of the white discs. It gets close, but does not
touch them. Then it returns to the position it held before.

Cassie-May O'Brien was torn. Ain't nothing in life for free, Dad said. But...
Cassie-May O'Brien: "..."
Cassie-May O'Brien put the one white disc in the cold palm.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The palm accepts the disc. It holds it for a moment, testing it maybe. It bounces the
disc in its palm twice. It did touch two of them.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "..."
Cassie-May O'Brien grabbed the other white disc. Ah, what the hell. If this was all it took... this was so
much better than her normal nightmares. Another white disc was sacrificed to the palm.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The palm accepts the second disc.The fingers curl closed and the palm becomes a
fist for a moment. It squeezes. When it opens again, the discs are gone. It reaches forward and gently takes
Cassie's arm.
Then it yanks her with the force of a cannon blast into blackness so dark that her eyes might as well be gone.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "!!!"
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Cassie travels through the darkness for some time. She can't tell if the palm is there
any longer, only tenebrous black remains.
Then.
Cassie realizes that the black is no longer the same.
It feels like the black of being in a room with no light, instead of being in...whatever she was before.
Cassie-May O'Brien reached out, feeling for... anything, really.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Aches and pains emerge. Strange ones that correspond to nothing that Cassie has
felt before. Alien sensations probing into her consciousness from some peculiar body.
The ground shifts.
Cloth moves.
Rustling of papers.
The rasp of a match, and finally some goddamn light.
(Can you see?)
Cassie-May O'Brien: (I can now)
Cassie-May O'Brien took a shaky step forward.
Cassie-May O'Brien then another. And another.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: A wall.

Dirty, and peculiar.
Cassie-May O'Brien moved along it, hand on the wall.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The wall seems to stop and give way to...the blackness of dreams.
It would not be a good idea to go beyond it, yet.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "..."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The ragged shoes on Cassie's alien body slosh through blood.
Cassie-May O'Brien knelt down. A body...?
Wonderful Cowboy Land: It is sticky, and coagulated, but not yet totally dry.
A man.
Well dressed, but very much dead.
There is a shining pistol in his hand, and something strange over his left eye.
It almost looks like a stove element.
Cassie-May O'Brien examines that weird something.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: On closer inspection, it seems to be a red light with a protective metal casing. It
extends out of the man's socket an inch.
There does not seem to be an eye underneath it.
Cassie-May O'Brien pulls it out
Wonderful Cowboy Land: It resists at first, but the hands of this odd body are strong, despite their decrepit look.
The contraption slides out of the man's socket with five good tugs.
There are several...wires hanging off it.
Cassie-May O'Brien stares at the contraption, dumbfounded.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Some are obviously copper, some look like viscera, and some shine oddly in the light
of the cigarette between the Smoker's teeth.
This is not something that should have been built.
Not something that any god fearing man would create.
It screams Mad Scientist.
Cassie-May O'Brien inspects the eye hole with the decrepit fingers of the other hand of this weird body.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Joints creak as Cassie makes the Smoker's body bend down and investigate the dead
man's eye socket.
The device seems to have taken up the space of...about three fourths of an index finger.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "..."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Then there's some mangled bits of squishy meat that Cassie takes to be brain.
Cassie-May O'Brien pats the corpse down, curious for other weird contraptions.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: There are bullets in one of the suit pockets. They are slick with partially dried blood.
Cassie-May O'Brien takes those. What caliber?

Wonderful Cowboy Land: The Smoker's hand transfers the bullets to his coat pocket. It holds up one for closer
inspection. Looks to be a forty-four. It has an odd engraving of a...bird on the side.
Cassie-May O'Brien looks for the reason for the corpse's demise.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: There's two holes in the pants leg of the corpse, and one in the upper chest.
Judging by the blood trail, the poor bastard might have been alive enough to crawl over here before bleeding out.
Cassie-May O'Brien pocketed the weird device and patted the corpse's pockets again to make sure, then
stood up.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The Smoker's body moves at Cassie's command. There's the tap of something
against the chest of the Smoker as he stands. Cassie can barely feel it amidst the aches, pains, and popping
joints, but it is there.
Cassie-May O'Brien glanced down and put her - his? - hand there, curious and confused.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Ah, a shoulder rig. Leather one.
There's a pistol in the holster.
Cassie-May O'Brien pulls out the gun.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: It is a heavy piece. Revolving cylinder, feels like a double action. Got an octagonal
barrel and a good grip. It feels right in the Smoker's hand, like a handshake from an old friend.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "..."
Cassie-May O'Brien checks the chamber.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The chamber is full. It takes six bullets. Four of them look to be spent.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "..."
Cassie-May O'Brien checks the corpse for holes again. Three wounds, yes?
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Three, two in the leg, one in the upper chest.
Cassie-May O'Brien assumed she was the shooter.
Cassie-May O'Brien came to where the blood trail started and knelt down again, feeling the ground for a...
hole? The bullet?
Wonderful Cowboy Land: There's nothing to find, save for the blood and a depression in the ground where the
Smoker laid.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "..."
". . ."
Cassie-May O'Brien checks for wounds on own body.
Cassie-May O'Brien in places the corpse was wounded.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: There's nothing on the Smoker's legs, but there is a hole in his gut. His left cheek has
a furrow carved into it.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "..."

Cassie-May O'Brien pulled the contraption from the corpse's eye out again with his/her left hand, and the
gun with the right.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The Smoker's hands do so.
Cassie-May O'Brien shoots the contraption.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: (Give me a tick)
Cassie-May O'Brien: oki oki
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Back
Smoker starts easing the trigger back. It gets fully cocked and the hammer snaps forward, but there is no
bang.
Smoker thumbs stopped the hammer before it could hit.
Smoker frowns.
Smoker: "I don't remember doing that."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Something else is waking up Cassie, and it's pushing you.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Mmmnnnngh...?"
Smoker reaches up to the cigarette between his teeth, and snuffs it.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Back to black.
Cassie, you feel right again.
There's bedsheets around you, covered in cold sweat.
Cassie-May O'Brien groaned. Is it morning again...? Was that enough sleep for her body..?"
Wonderful Cowboy Land: There is a light, but it doesn't feel bright enough to be the sun coming through the
window.
Cassie-May O'Brien felt around. This... was better than her usual nightmares.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: There's a lantern burning on the nightstand. A bottle of whiskey sits next to it. The
bottle still has frost clinging to the outside.
Cassie-May O'Brien grabbed the bottle.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Cool to the touch.
Cassie-May O'Brien pulled it over amd took a gulp.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The whiskey rolls down Cassie's throat with a smooth, icy burn. It feels good. Takes a
little bit of the edge off.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Ffffuck."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The night goes on.
(There you go.)

Wonderful Cowboy Land: Nephi and the injured girl carrying her far more injured cat catch Alexander as he's
coming out of the marshalry. Sacks is following along behind him. Sacks is always following along behind Alex.
The little girl has been possessed with a peculiar calm the entire time. Having a beloved pet on the brink of death
normally provokes more tears and less stoic determination.

Alexander Hauswald pauses in his tracks, examining the girl and Nephi, and noticing the cat.
Alexander Hauswald: ""... What'd you do?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Nothin!"
"...Well, okay, I shot a thing."
"But not this thing!"
(BRB real quick one second need to do a thing)
Little Girl: "He told me that we were going to someone who could help Grimmie."
Alexander Hauswald: "... Suppose that's me. Let me have a look at him."
"...Not here, though. Hang on. I got a room by the salloon whete it's cleaner."
Little Girl: "If you think Grimmie will last that long."
Little Girl hugs the matted ball of fur close to her bloodied chest.
Alexander Hauswald: "I can't fix him with my bare hands. Come on. Let's hurry."
Little Girl follows Alexander. She glances at Sacks a few times on the way, but the glances grow less
frequent after she is sure he is not going to do anything to her cat.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano follows
Sacks just stares at her, before following his master.
Alexander Hauswald: ((skip to like, two minutes later when they reach his room?
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The party reaches the saloon. No one blinks as they bring a girl with blood dripping
down her dress with them. The bartender does indicate that they should stay away from the rugs though.
Alexander Hauswald kicks the door to his room open and moves everything from a nearby table.
Alexander Hauswald: "Put him on the table. Nephi, go down and get a bottle of something strong."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano does exactly that and...
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Uh."
"Alex."
"How will I know which one's strong?"
Alexander Hauswald: "You ask the bartender. Tell him I need it as disinfectant.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...I don't- Got it."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads down and rushes in the general direction of the bartender.
Alexander Hauswald reaches for his suitcase, pulling out a set of tools and setting them carefully.
Alexander Hauswald: "when's thr last time Grimmie ate?"
Little Girl sets her cat on the table. She keeps pressure on the area that has the most puncture wounds,
but the cat still oozes blood onto the tabletop.
Little Girl: "This morning."

"About five hours ago."
Alexander Hauswald takes a rag and a bottle of chloroform.
Alexander Hauswald: "Good. Means we can sedate him."
Bartender is waxing his mustache when Nephi comes back down the stairs.
Bartender: "Hmm?"
Alexander Hauswald gently presses the now-wet rag against the cat's face, gently making sure he's not
causing any more damage.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Alex needs some disinfectant!"
"...Gimme the most alchol-y alcohol you got that alcohols."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The cat breathes in the chloroform for a few minutes. Then his breathing get a little
more shallow.
Alexander Hauswald: "Alright. We can operate."
Alexander Hauswald tries to check the damage, looking at the door.
Bartender stares at Nephi for about five seconds before putting away his mustache wax tin. He bends
down and rummages underneath the bar, then slams a jar of clear liquid onto the countertop.
Bartender: "Dollar."
Alexander Hauswald: "Nephi, hurry up!"
Wonderful Cowboy Land: There is no wound that is overly terrifying. Each one is about as bad as getting a
fishook ripped out, but there are a lot of them, centered around the cat's belly.
Alexander Hauswald: "...These aren't as bad as I thought. There's just a lot of them."
Alexander Hauswald turns to the girl.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano slams down a dollar from his pocket
Alexander Hauswald: "I thought Nephi shot him."
Bartender takes the dollar.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano grabs the jar as soon as it's offered then runs his ass upstaris
Little Girl: "It was a not tumbleweed."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano bursts through the door like a man possessed.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "ALEX! Hah-hur-hurf, just... One sec-"
Alexander Hauswald: "...I know the kind-"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano holds out the jar
Alexander Hauswald grabs the jar, opens it, and takes a tentative sniff.

Alexander Hauswald: "... This'll do. This'll do fine."

"Alright, ah'm good now."
Little Girl: "You must not run a lot."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Not like that, no!"
Alexander Hauswald: "Alright. Most of these aren't bad. We could get away with cleaning and bandaging them. A
few are gonna need a stitch."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: It's time to roll.
Alexander Hauswald sets the jar of livercide on the table, gently using it to wet another rag and clean a
needle from his toolset, before gently dabbing at the wounds. With the alcohol rag. He doesn't expect to
cringe the germs away.
Alexander Hauswald: What do I roll, again? 5d12?

UrbanCritter: Did we save the catte?
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Alexander manages to get the cat's wounds under control with a liberal use of plasters
and stitches on the wider holes. The bleeding is slowed significantly after he finishes. Within five minutes there is
only an occasional drop of blood that seeps out. The cat's breath is still shallow, but it is stable.
UrbanCritter wipes his brow, sighing.
Little Girl looks down at the patchwork kitty. She sighs and the tension in her body eases.
Little Girl: "Thank you."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Good work, Alex."
UrbanCritter: ""He'll live."
"Now, listen. Don't let him get out of your sight until he gets better. He WILL try to pick on the stitches and
bandaging."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: Your name's wrong
Alexander Hauswald: "And try to keep his diet light. As liquid as possible for the next few days."
"Overall, he should be fine."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has found a nearby chair and sat himself down in it.
Little Girl nods as Alex dispenses medicinal wisdom. She reaches out a hand and rests it against the cat's
head.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Y'know you never introduced yourself, little missy."
Little Girl: "You never asked for my name, and a gentleman is supposed to make the first move."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "A-"
"...Well alright ya got me there."
Alexander Hauswald: "If everything's alright, come in about two weeks so we could get the stitches out."
Little Girl: "You don't seem like much of a gentleman though."
Alexander Hauswald looks at the little scene, the barest hint of a smile on his face.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "A-hey! Ah'll have you know I'm a spittin'image of a right gentleman."
Little Girl: "Is that why you have all those guns?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...M'workin through some things."
"Gentlemen carry guns."
Little Girl: "They carry guns on their hip, sometimes."
"Not rifles."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...I got bigger things to shoot."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano stands up and heads for the room's little window, looking out of it towards the
horizon.
Alexander Hauswald just cleans his hands and starts packing, his back turned to them as he fights the
urge to laugh.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano doesn't seem well at ease until he's done this.
Little Girl stands there with blood down the front of her dress and a slight frown on her face.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano eventually seems satisfied with what he sees out there.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Now, c'mon. Let's get you cleaned up."
"M'sure we can find a bucket somewhere round here."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano returns with his duster coat slung over one shoulder.
Alexander Hauswald: "Le me pack up and we'll be on our way."
Alexander Hauswald starts packing up, putting the jar of theoretically-alcohol on the shelf.
Sacks was remarkably silent all this time.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Ready to mosey on outta here, Alex?"
Alexander Hauswald: "Let's go."
Little Girl walks forward with the cat, careful to maintain a good grip on him.
Bartender watches as the party leaves the saloon. His mustache is now waxed. It looks luxuriant.
Alexander Hauswald nods at the bartender knowingly.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano just carries on.
Bartender does not change his expression in the slightest. He does pick up a glass and begin to polish it
with a stained white cloth.

I'll be back.
Alexander Hauswald: "... Haven't asked. What's your name, kid?"

Little Girl: "Tessa."
The little girl leads Nephi and Alexander through a twisting complex of alleyways and fences. It is difficult to know
exactly where they are. The three of them come to a door.
Little Girl pulls a key out of the pockets of her dress. It shines in the dusk light.
Alexander Hauswald: "Alexander."
Alexander Hauswald just patiently waits.
Little Girl walks up the little set of steps to the door and inserts the key into the lock below the handle.
She twists. Something inside the lock clicks. Tessa pushes the door open.
Alexander Hauswald remains stationary- he wasn't invited in. It's basic manners, really.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano does the same.
Tessa: "You can come in if you want."
Tessa takes the key out of the lock with one hand and tucks it back into a pocket of her dress. It
squelches a little. Probably all the blood.
Alexander Hauswald takes a look around before following the girl, wiping his boots before he enters and
closing the door after him.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano doesn't actually do that
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The door does not open, because it is not unlocked. Alex does manage to jiggle the

Nephi "Longiron" Delano raises a curious eyebrow.
Tessa pushes the door open and enters the room. It is a small affair. Most of the space is taken up by a
bed in the corner, and the books all over the floor. Tessa walks through the maze of tomes and lays her
cat on the bed.
Alexander Hauswald: "...You live alone?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Yeah, don't you got any parents? Or uh, siblings?"

Thin Waiter extends an arm to the seat and bows his head a few degrees.
Crystal Saint Claire nods.
Crystal Saint Claire sits.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Thank you."
Thin Waiter: "Would you like a few moments to look over the menu madam?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "...yes, please."
Thin Waiter: "Then I shall return to my post. If you have need, call on Miss Jan."
Thin Waiter struts back to his podium and attends to the book on the podium.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Thank you. I will."
Crystal Saint Claire looks at the menu.
Machinist looks up from his sandwich for a few seconds to observe the new arrival. His eyes slip down to
his food after a minute analysis.

Crystal Saint Claire tries to observe said Machinist. What does he look like he could do? Possible threat?
Crystal Saint Claire: (Cognition?)
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The menu reads, "Special today- Trout in a garlic based Oriental sauce. SandwichesReuben, Gustav Special, Steak in a bun. Salads- Mixed Greens and chicken with Oriental dressing, Romaine with
breaded lamb. Steaks of all sizes and cuts, cooked to order. Sides vary with dish." There is a list of beer, wine,
and soda on the back.
Crystal Saint Claire: (That is a lot of typing)
(There we go)
(...is that a fucking hamburger)
She will get...
Hm...
She looks for "Miss Jan"
Machinist is dressed in a stained vest and an undershirt that has a tattoo peeking over the top. He looks
young, but weathered. There is a cigarette butt next to his plate.
Missus Waiter: "...salad, Gustav, and?"
Wily Galen: "I'll just have a bottle of red."
Crystal Saint Claire hears a familiar voice!
Crystal Saint Claire turns towards that voice!
Missus Waiter: "Right."
Crystal Saint Claire: "...oh!"
"Hello, Mr. Garen!"
Wily Galen the skin around his eyes scrunches together for a moment in what might be a blink. He turns
to Crystal. Recognition dawns after a moment and he waves.
Wily Galen: "Hey kid."
Crystal Saint Claire: "How has your day been?"
Missus Waiter looks to Crystal, then flips to a new page in her notebook.
Crystal Saint Claire glances at the soda menu.
Wily Galen: "Pretty good, haven't had more than eight people drag my name through the mud."
Crystal Saint Claire: Is there sasparilla?
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Yes.
Crystal Saint Claire: "...why would people drag your name through the mud? It would be like insulting a cripple..."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: There is also an option to upgrade any soda to a sarsaparilla float.
Crystal Saint Claire seems genuinely confused at this

Wily Galen: "Well, there's some folks that do insult cripples."
Crystal Saint Claire moves closer so that they aren't calling out across the restaurant.
Crystal Saint Claire: "They are, almost to the person, detestable."
Wily Galen: "Mmmm."
Crystal Saint Claire: "I say almost because I cannot provide empirical evidence."
Wily Galen: "What kind of evidence?"
Missus Waiter taps the table with her pencil.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Empirical. Evidence that cannot-- oh! Sorry..."
Missus Waiter: "Ready to order?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "May I have a sasparilla, and the Gustav Special, please?"
"...what is the gustav special?"
Missus Waiter scribbles the order down on her pad before looking up again.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Is the cook's name Gustav?"
Missus Waiter: "Cook's name is Duret."
"Gustav handles the...beverages."
"Liberal consumption of which was involved in the creation of the Gustav Special."
Crystal Saint Claire: "...that sounds interesting."
Missus Waiter: "It's a sandwich with two chicken breasts battered and covered in hot sauce. Add a few fixings
and a good slice of sharp cheddar and you got the Gustav special."
Crystal Saint Claire: "...That sounds delicious!"
"...Would you mind asking them to be gentle, with the heat?"
Missus Waiter: "No problem."
Crystal Saint Claire: "...Thank you!"
Missus Waiter: "That all?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "Y-yes, ma'am."
Missus Waiter: "Right, should have it out in a couple minutes."
Missus Waiter turns on her heel and slumps off towards the counter at the back.
Crystal Saint Claire nods, and brings her workbook up onto the counter.
Crystal Saint Claire: She's on a page with... math... on it.
Fat Waiter pops out of the small doorway that leads behind the counter with visible effort. He bounces
over to the table where Galen and the rest of the marshalry crew sit with a tray of drinks held aloft by one
hand.

Alexander Hauswald: "Job offer. We're the new marshals."
Rockett Rimbjob raises her brows.
Rockett Rimbjob: "New marshals?"
Fat Waiter sets both down in the middle of the table and takes the silvery serving trays back to his post
behind the counter.
(From Rockett Rimbjob): would she know about this also who's a marshal
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Eeeyup. Jus' got ourselves our stars."
(From Rockett Rimbjob): also is rockett in law enforcement at all
(From Rockett Rimbjob): also what's the waiter's name
Cassie-May O'Brien pushed the platters with food to respective owners and took a huge gulp of her beer.
Rockett Rimbjob grabs her own beer happily.
Rockett Rimbjob: "Ain't that somethin'."
Alexander Hauswald set the plate with the rare steak aside, grabbing his own steak-in-a-bun.
Cassie-May O'Brien cracked her fingers and stared at the extra spicy Gustav Special.
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers takes a bite of her sandwich and washes it down with a gulp of beer
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Tally ho."
Alexander Hauswald: "Asked for us specifically, too."
Cassie-May O'Brien ate a forkful.
Rockett Rimbjob: "Really."
"Who'd ya impress?"
"Or who'd ya blow?"
Alexander Hauswald looks at Cassie, judging her reaction before taking a bite from his sandwich.
Alexander Hauswald shrugs at Rockett.
(To Scotty): Yep. The Marshals are the law in the neutral territories. Kansas City is their base of operations. They
also hire out their services to other places if the price is right. Rockett works for the marshalry sometimes when
there's a job that suits the taste of her and her pocketbook. The fat one is Gustav, he does the drinks.. The woman
one is Jan, she does the not wanting to be here. The thin one is Einhart, he runs most of the hotel. The cook's
name is Duret.
Cassie-May O'Brien is waiting for Doc's decision
Alexander Hauswald: "Just got the letter one day. Not exactly well known before."
Rockett Rimbjob: "Hey, Gustav!" she calls.
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: "Same here. Ah mean, Ah'd done some Ranger work b'fore."

Fat Waiter perks up from where he was pouring himself a bottle of wine, pouring it down his throat
straight from the bottle.
Rockett Rimbjob: "Can a bring me a payback, honeydoll?"
(From Rockett Rimbjob): a cigar
Fat Waiter nods for a moment before disappearing through the doors to, assumedly, the kitchen.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Eh, from whut Ah can take, each of us got sum' fun adventures under our belts."
Cassie-May O'Brien ate another forkful.
Alexander Hauswald: "..."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Ain' half bad. Coulda stand ta be spicier."
Alexander Hauswald took a bite from his own sandwich, slowly reaching for the beer.
Rockett Rimbjob: "But. Ah'm familiar with tha Marshals. They usually bring in good folk, but... they been lax
lately, it seems. Lazy. Maybe a little desperate."
"Y'all ain't second-rate, are ya?"
"Or crooks? Ah hate crooks."
Cassie-May O'Brien looked at Rockett
Fat Waiter pops back out and heads over to Rockett with a cigar in one hand and a matchbook in the
other.
Alexander Hauswald: "I think we're the new generation."
Rockett Rimbjob takes the cigar and matchbook, nodding to him once.
Fat Waiter proffers the payback.
Rockett Rimbjob: "Thank ya kindly."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Ain' no second-rate crook, sugercube."
Fat Waiter bows with one arm held over his paunch, and retires to his drinking.
Rockett Rimbjob: "Good ta hear. Ah take it ya gonna prove that ta me soon, then."
"Somethin' tells me it ain't a coincidence y'all showed up right now, right here."
Alexander Hauswald lifts a brow.
Alexander Hauswald: ((Also, doc, verdict on the spicy?))
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Y'all knew them deposed marshals, missus Rockett?"
Rockett Rimbjob: "They was mah steady income, friends, an' colleagues -- sure as shit Ah knew 'em."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The spiciness appears to have been tailored to be not too terrifying, unless the fool
who ordered it asked for the spice. In that case, the spice appears mild at first, but after one good bite goes down
the hatch, it comes up from the stomach like a volcanic eruption.
Rockett Rimbjob lights her thin cigar and gives it a few puffs to get it burning.

(From Rockett Rimbjob): do I know anything from being a nosy whore
dimVitrarius: added to charsheet, doc.
(To Scotty): Information seems scant. Dead marshals tell no tales. All that anyone seems to know right now is
that they appear to be dying in the line of work. There's something real goddamn fishy about that though and not a
lot has been done to hide it. Just enough is wrong to know there's something up without enough being wrong to
find out what the cause is.
(To Scotty): Like Jones a couple months ago. He was a good shooter, and a tough bastard to kill. Died in a
shootout with some strange desperado that rolled into town and rolled out soon as Jones was cold.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: (Gonna be away for a bit.)
Rockett Rimbjob: "Well. Ah wish Ah could tell ya anythin' more'n Ah already know. Much as Ah hate ta say it,
dead marshals tell no tales. Fishier'n an unwashed ham-holster, an' it's infuriatin' that Ah ain't been able ta do

"Ah'm employed, but in mah line of work, business an' pleasure are one an' tha same -- jus' so happens ya get ta

"Don't blame 'em, bastard just about got shot."
Alexander Hauswald: "...Guess that's our first witness, Cass."

black as coal.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Doc Mitchell in Dodge. Y'all know of anyun' else who coulda see th' scene?"
Rockett Rimbjob: "...Ah actually heard one thing from mah last buyer. But it ain't nothin' surprisin' -- he was one

Rockett Rimbjob sets down an enormous derringer on the counter -- a good five inch long barrel, with a

Cassie-May O'Brien pinched the bridge of her nose and snorted a laugh.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano realizes he just apologized to a dog for being patronizing.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano blinks for a minute, then decides to stop thinking about it.
Cassie-May O'Brien looks over at the smol un.
Tessa: "Was that Mister Nephi just now?"
Alexander Hauswald: "...Can't find a bettero ne, that's for sure-"
Alexander Hauswald recognizes the kid.
Rockett Rimbjob: "Mister Nephi needed some fresh air, missie."
Alexander Hauswald: "How's Grimmie?"
Tessa: "Grimmie is alright. I left him with Mrs. Rhodes."
Sacks ... You swear he shrugged, clearly done with this. He does scooch a bit closer to Nephi.

Alexander Hauswald: "Good, good."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano continues scratching.
Alexander Hauswald looks at Cass and Rockett.
Rockett Rimbjob: "Ah'll be back in a sec. Gonna make right with tha poor guy."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks up at the sky.
Tessa waves to Rockett as she goes.
Alexander Hauswald: "...This is Tessa. Me and Nephi saved her cat."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Tha' explains it."
Sacks lazily wags his tail.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...I just wanna do right by them, you know?"
Rockett Rimbjob walks outside and leans against the wall next to the doorway, taking a drag from her
cigar.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Rockett makes her way outside. Nephi is there, talking to a scrappy looking mutt.
Rockett Rimbjob: "Don't worry none, sweetie. You ain't done no wrong yet."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Stay away from the loose ladies, keep to the faith."
Tessa hops up onto Rockett's recently vacated seat.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...It's hard. Ah just..."
Rockett Rimbjob: "You ain't too upset, are ya?" she asks calmly.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Tryin to-"
Tessa grows a little frustrated when her head barely reaches over the tabletop.
Sacks looks at the pretty lady.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano seems much calmer now, outside.
Tessa: "What set off Mister Nephi?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Yeah. Ah'm..."
Rockett Rimbjob takes a drag from her cigar.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Ah'm sorry I reacted-"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano shakes his head and takes in a deep breath.
Alexander Hauswald: "...He's not too good with ladies."
"Miss Rockett was a bit too forward."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Like a two-bit buffoon."

Wonderful Cowboy Land: It has been a troubling few days for Whitney. The sickness that came on a few days
after she arrived kept her in her room above at the saloon. Crystal kept an eye on her, though she insisted on
wearing a gas mask. The illness passed a day after it arrived and Whitney is feeling her oats again. She heads
over to the Marshalry offices to talk to the man that summoned her.
Wily Galen pokes his head up over his desk to look at the new arrival.
Wily Galen: "Hey, Emilia."
Secretary: "What is it Ga-"
"Oh."
Secretary shoves her chair back from her desk and strides over to Whitney.
Whitney G. Elieen moves forward,one heavy step at a time. Feeling refreshed after so long spent in
sickness.
Whitney G. Elieen: "Hello. God bless you this fine morning...I am here to answer my summons."
Secretary: "Hello, you must be Miss Whitney."
"Foss-"
Secretary clears her throat.
Secretary: "The Overmarshal is waiting for you."

Secretary: "Right this way."

Secretary walks up to the desk at the back of the office where a dark skinned, black haired man sits with
his boots up on his desk and his hat over his eyes.

Overmarshal Fossifer: "I take it you are Miss Whitney?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "Yes. That is I. Whitney Gould Elieen."
Overmarshal Fossifer: "And I'm Mister Fossifer."
Whitney G. Elieen: "God Bless, Mr.Fossifer...I am here to answer your summons."
"I am sorry I did not get to meet sooner. I came ill of disease. Normally God has blessed me with good health, but
this time I feel I was to be tested."
Overmarshal Fossifer holds his hand up for a moment as if to speak, but ends the movement holding his
chin.
Overmarshal Fossifer: "I see."
"I called you, and your companions, here, because I am in need of a miracle."
"My marshals have been dying by the dozen."
"I do not know an exact reason why."
"But I need help."
"Help from people who want to do good work."
Overmarshal Fossifer: "People no concerned with money, or power of a badge."
Whitney G. Elieen: "I see. How blessed you are that I work for the ultimate miracle maker." She says with a
smile. "I have been led here I believe for a reason. To save as many as I can and to show them that the Lord I
serve has not ignored their prayers."
"I have no interest in the badge and have no need for mortal trappings beyond what is necessary to do his work. "
"I need only direction."
Overmarshal Fossifer grunts as he drags a hand across the lines of his face.
Overmarshal Fossifer: "Don't agree about Lord business, but agree that people need to be saved."
"Told your friends about losing Billy's old caselog."
"Figured he might be alive enough to worry about."
"But, heard them while at lunch."
"Met up with Rockett and she put them on the scent of Doc Mitchell."
"Part of deal about Mysterious gunslinger shot Jones two months back."
Overmarshal Fossifer: "Knew it was real bad when Mitchell up and ran."
"Not too brave, but don't know him to abandon patient."
Whitney G. Elieen: "That is the beautiful thing about him, Overmarshal. He believes in you even if you do not
believe in him. But as for Mitchel...odd that a doctor would abandon his oath to his patient."

Whitney G. Elieen: "I would like to pay a visit to her if i can. For reasons spiritual and mundane."
"She knows our direction after all."
Overmarshal Fossifer squints at something he can only see for a moment, before turning to the red haired
woman in the green dress.
Secretary: "I can probably find her at the hotel if need be."
"And you, being so capable, can do without me for a little while."
Overmarshal Fossifer gives a solemn nod to the Secretary's words.
Overmarshal Fossifer: "Anything else you need Miss Whitney?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "Nothing further at this time."
Overmarshal Fossifer: "I don't have anything else for you."
"Just remember that I am here."
"Maybe your Lord need me to help you for Him sometime."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Perhaps he does. As I follow her path it will become clear either way. Wherever the path
takes me I shall follow."
"God bless you Overmarshal."
Overmarshal Fossifer: "..."
"Her, path?"
"Never heard anyone consider that before."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Yes. Her path. It would be folly to think of God in the limited binary of us, the created. He is
beyond our understanding but for his power and splendor and her mercy and love."
"Such is the word of God herself."
Overmarshal Fossifer says nothing as he scratches the scruff of his chin. His eyes stay on Whitney.
Overmarshal Fossifer: "Wise words, wiser than I've heard in long time."
"Glad to have you Miss Whitney."

size at first, but spreads a grin across her face and attempt conversation despite.
Secretary: "So, would you like to discuss..."
"Erm..."
"Your...faith?"
"Apologies, I don't know too much about you other than your religious preference and your history of do goodery."
"It was, the most salient information."
"I'm sure there's more to you than that."
Secretary: "Not to say that it isn't good to show yourself, righteous and all that."
"I..."
"Am babbling."
Whitney G. Elieen: "No. No you are fine. Though I would like to discuss faith. If you are so inclined." She says
with a warm smile, looking down at the much smaller woman.
"I am always happy to discuss my faith with the curious."
Secretary: "I am curious."
"Some say it's my vice."
"Sticking my nose where some don't like noses stuck."
Whitney G. Elieen: "A dangerous trait. But a righteous one. God loves those who love to know. Though if the
story of Eden is any indication it does not come without its grave dangers."
"There is also a strong danger in not knowing. Ignorance of the greater truth has doomed humanity since before
and beyond the era of Christ."
Secretary: "I suppose there are some things I'd rather not know, but I only knew that after I'd learned them."
"But knowing more has helped us all a great deal."
"And once knowledge begins it perpetuates itself, to some extent."
"Like a stone rolling down a hill."

now is to react to the stone. We can either use what we know and step out of the way or be ignorant of it and be
rolled over."
Secretary: "...that's a direction I hadn't considered for that simile."
"But, I suppose it applies."
Whitney G. Elieen: "The knowledge in and of itself is neither good nor evil. How we respond to this knowledge,
however, can be either. "
Secretary: "I can agree to that."
"Nobel invented dynamite for construction and excavation."
"Not as a tool of war."
Whitney G. Elieen: "It depends a lot on the knowledge I suppose. Some is hard to grasp. Some is beyond our
comprehension as mortal beings...and some brings sublime comfort."
"Or so it should."
"The bible is a great tool...but a dangerous one in the hands of those who do not understand it."
"Or refuse to."
"Like dynamite"
Secretary: "Indeed, Copernicus comes to mind."
"The bible has nothing to say on heliocentric or geocentric theory, but the papacy assumed the knowledge of the
day to be part of God's truth and would hear nothing to contradict their geocentric view."
Whitney G. Elieen: "I know little of the sciences...but I do know a great deal of the folly of mortal churches. The
papacy in particular. A decadent institution more concerned with dogma and ritual than truth...and yet through
them God can work wonders."
"Yet it saddens me...and saddens her for that matter that her message of love can be warped and twisted so."
Secretary nods her head with evident enthusiasm.
Secretary: "Yes, it is so frustrating when people refuse to understand."
"They don't look at what you're showing them."
"They're looking at something inside their own heads."
Whitney G. Elieen: "They are not concerned with her truth...but their truth. The truth that is most comforting to
them."
"Jesus fought hard against this when he was here on this earth."
"Not many know but he was quite the rebel."
"Spreading the message of the Lord and her truth of love, despite what the Pharisees taught."
"The pharisees being, at the time, among the highest of their religious order. These were Godly men. Or so it was
said."
Secretary: "People do often say they are one thing while they are something entirely different."
Whitney G. Elieen: "One can have the faith to move mountains...the gift of prophecy, command of the kingdoms
of man and beyond and yet if they have not love in their hearts..."
"They are nothing."
"Today it is more than just the Pharsiee we must look out for...the forces of evil have become bold."

"They know their time is coming to a close. So they seek to turn as many away from God's love as they can."
Secretary: "I suppose."
"From what I've seen, there are more concerned with damning the mortal body to a wormy pit than slaying souls."
Whitney G. Elieen: "And it is in this wormy pit that they learn to despair. The forces of evil are blunt. Jesus
himself paid the ultimate price because of it."
"And yet he overcame all the same."
Secretary: "Indeed he did."
"Indeed..."
Secretary twiddles her finger as the Kansas City hotel comes into view.
Secretary: "I'm going to be honest and say that I have no idea what to say next."
"Though, we are here, sort of."
"Miss Rockett should not be hard to find."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Remember this. God loves you. I shall keep you in my prayers. Knowledge can be comfort
as well...take comfort that she is watching over you."
"Thank you kindly for taking me here."
Emilia: "Oh, no problem at all."
"If you need any help finding Miss Rockett, talk to the waiters."
"The thin one is Einhart, the lady who looks like she wants to be somewhere else is Jan, the fat one is Gustav, and
the cook with the odd hair is Duret."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Thank you so much." She says with a smile. "Be safe and God bless."
"I am sure the waiters will guide my way from here."
Emilia: "Right, be safe Miss Whitney."
Emilia turns and walks off to the marshalry offices.
Emilia: (That should be good until tomorrow, or when we can get Scotty.)
Whitney G. Elieen: (Yes!~)

Rockett Rimjob takes another gulp from her beer, then looks at the bottle's label for a moment.
Rockett Rimjob: "...how many's that? Three? Ah oughta keep tabs on mah tab 'fore Ah head outta here..."
Cassie-May O'Brien seemed to be chasing beer with coffee and vice versa, one beverage per hand.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Eeeyup, Ah think tha's three. Ah divide mah attenshiun wit' coffee an' yer guzzlin' them

Rockett Rimjob: "Ain't had much ta eat t'day. Means Ah want more. An' it makes 'em kick a little harder'n they
usually do."
Rockett Rimjob sighs, swirling her beer around in the bottle she holds. "It'll be good ta head back ta
Dodge though. Ain't been there fer a time."
Rockett Rimjob: "Y'ever been?"
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Ta Dodge? Eeeyup, once. Jus' in passin', though. Didn' see much a' it."
Rockett Rimjob: "Not a bad place. Ain't too big, but it's got its charm. Few caravaners an' workers with some
stuffy wallets Ah'm familiar with."
"Usually spend a spell there on mah way west an' east."
"They got a nice bar. Real nice. Place ya'd never expect ta find in a place like Dodge."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Ah thought Dodge's made solely outta places y'all don't expect ta find in Dodge."
Cassie-May O'Brien took a gulp of beer.
Rockett Rimjob: "...'bout sums it up, honestly."
Cassie-May O'Brien grinned.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Y'all been travellin' a lot?"
Rockett Rimjob: "Oh, you bet."
"Moment Ah left home Ah kept walkin' with these boots of mahne 'til Ah found a coast."
"Then Ah turned around an' kept walkin' again. 'Til Ah got bored of that -- then Ah started walkin' south 'til Ah hit
tha Rio Grande, an' north 'til Ah got too cold."
"Don't usually cross tha Mississippi no more, though. Ah tend ta like it out here."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Ah'm pretty cimilar, sugercube. Jus' Ah got enough of a brains ta git mahself a horse when
Ah could."
Cassie-May O'Brien sipped coffee.
Rockett Rimjob gives Cassie a look.
Rockett Rimjob: "Smartass."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "All tha' walkin' done good fer yer calves though."
Rockett Rimjob: "Thank you, thank you~!"
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Gotta put sum' honey on all tha' smartass stingin', don't Ah?"
Cassie-May O'Brien snickered.
Rockett Rimjob: "Smartasses keep tha world interestin'. Or they make it tough."

Cassie-May O'Brien: "Which un' am Ah so far?"
Rockett Rimjob: "Well, ya ain't been dumb enough ta pull a gun on me yet."
"Ah'd say yer doin' good on me."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Ye wuzn' dumb enough ta giv' meh a reason ta pull a gun on yew, so... Guess we're gunna

"...This reminds meh. Ah always fergit to do tha'."
Cassie-May O'Brien grumbled to herself, finished her beer, and pulled out the double-barrelled shotgun on
the table before her.
Rockett Rimjob looks at it.
Rockett Rimjob: "...not bad."
"Little hefty fer mah tastes, though."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Mnn."
Cassie-May O'Brien broke it open and fished out the two shells.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Plan B here saved mah sorry arse a few tahmes, hefty as it is."
Rockett Rimjob: "Better'n no gun, that's fer sure."
"Pretty good-lookin', too, even though it ain't mah style."
Cassie-May O'Brien checked the barrells and put in two different-colored shells. Slugs.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Ah usually am fahne wit' mah Winchester. This here's mostleh fer them oh-shit scenarios,
sugercube."
Cassie-May O'Brien - come to think of it - has an absurd amount of weapons on her. This shotgun, the
Winchester rifle secure in the sling, a Colt Navy on her hip, a saber on other hip, a Bowie knife, another
two knives...
Rockett Rimjob: "...luggin' around all that iron oughta be a real pain."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Mah back's killin' meh."
Rockett Rimjob: "That's why Ah got an all-purpose fucker-upper on mah thigh."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Eeeyup, but it got only two shots innit."
Rockett Rimjob: "Most situations don't need more than one. Tha rest? Heaven ferbid, Ah might spend a whole
quarter second jammin' two more in there."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Mmn. Hope y'all never git in a situation yew realize luggin' a loaded spare iron's faster

Cassie-May O'Brien stopped herself.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Eh, um, righ'. Think Ah'm gunna need anuther beer."
Rockett Rimjob: "Ah got another one'a these. Somewhere."

Rockett Rimjob chuckles, at that.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Dunnaw, yew dun' smite lil' Nephi there like an archangel woulda."
Cassie-May O'Brien put the shotgun away and motioned at the waitress to get her another beer.
Rockett Rimjob: "Ah'll hav'ta catch up with Pastor Creely. If he's even Pastor anymore."
"That's a fun story."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Y'all wanna tell it?"
Cassie-May O'Brien grinned.
Rockett Rimjob: "You ever seen an entire town get turned upside down by a pretty little thang in cowboy boots
an' a shoulder-slip?"
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Eeeenope?"
Rockett Rimjob: "Well. Little place called Castle Rock. Tiny town, not more'n a hunnerd people, or so. Real cute,
simple. Not far from Salt Lake."
"Ah stroll in there on mah way east. Don't got no waterin' hole, since it's an awfully devout place, so Ah head to
tha barber's. Figger Ah might as well trim up."
"Have a nice conversation with a well-dressed gennleman as he's gettin' 'is 'stache all nice an' pretty. Push came
ta shove, he enned up payin' me a king's ransom an' pullin' me ta his home."
"Now, in places like Castle Rock, somebody's eyes are always watchin' -- ain't no doubt there're pryin' eyes 'round
ev'ry corner, with such a tiny community. Ah was used ta it. Don't mind tha attention, neither."
"What Ah didn't know was that Ah jus' bagged tha Pastor."
"Tha married pastor with kids who was also tha effective mayor an' de facto sheriff."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Th' whole package, huh?"
Rockett Rimjob: "Oh you bet."
"You could guess 'bout how happy tha whole town was when word got 'round. Didn't take long for ev'ry set 'f ears
ta hear bout Creely an' 'is adventures while his wife was in Salt Lake."
"Ah snuck out tha back window when tha mob came ta his front door."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Serves him righ' fer thinkin' wit' his pecker!"
Rockett Rimjob: "Guess it does. Felt kinda sorry. If Ah'da known who he was, even Ah woulda told 'em ta
reconsider. But Ah'd only rolled inta town that afternoon."
"Found out later that he was kicked outta town. Not sure what happened ta Castle Rock since then, but Ah think
they're unner new management."
"Might stop by with a duster an' some overalls one day, jus' ta see."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Y'all got meh curious. Ah wanna see tha'!"
Rockett Rimjob: "Well. Ain't too sure if we're headed that way, but if we do..."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Then it woulda be a nice sidetrack ta git distracted by."
Rockett Rimjob: "...maybe do it again. Fer kicks."
Cassie-May O'Brien snorted into her coffee.

Rockett Rimjob: "'S mah middle name."
"Papa tried fixin' me. An' Ah tried bein' reasonable."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Didn' werk out?"
Rockett Rimjob leans back, and kicks her ruby red kickers onto the table.
Rockett Rimjob: "Didn't take to it, naw."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Well, s- ooh. There's Whitney. Oi! Whitney!"
Cassie-May O'Brien waved to the newcomer.
Whitney G. Elieen: "..."
Whitney G. Elieen walks slowly towards the two, each step falling heavy on the wood flooring
Rockett Rimjob smiles, thinking about the conversation she just had, and then turns to face this Whitney
character.
Rockett Rimjob 's face immediately deflates.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Howdy, sugercube."
Cassie-May O'Brien blinks.
Cassie-May O'Brien blink blinks.
Rockett Rimjob is leaning back, in her scanty dress, red boots on the table, smelling of alcohol, tobacco,
and sex.
Whitney G. Elieen: "Hello Cassie..."
Cassie-May O'Brien looks between the two.
Whitney G. Elieen: "And hello to you Judy."
Rockett Rimjob: "..."
Rockett Rimjob stands up.
Cassie-May O'Brien: '...Judy?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "It has been a long while...but I could never forget that face of yours."
Rockett Rimjob: "How tha hell'd you find me? And--And don't call me Judy," she barks. Her happy demeanor she
held a moment before is all but gone, replaced with some sort of long-seething anger.
Whitney G. Elieen: "I did not find you."
Cassie-May O'Brien: ".....Sssssso Ah guess yew two know each other already."
Whitney G. Elieen: "I did not seek you, though you have been in my prayers for a very long time."
Rockett Rimjob turns to Cassie.

Cassie-May O'Brien looks confused and alert.
Rockett Rimjob chops at her neck with one of her hands. Seems she wants Cass to clam it.
Whitney G. Elieen: "I ask God every other night where you might be...her response is always the same."
Cassie-May O'Brien blinks.
Rockett Rimjob turns back to look at Whitney.
Cassie-May O'Brien slooowly brings the coffee mug to her lips and takes a sip, watching the scene.
(From Cassie-May O'Brien): "Ah wish Ah got popcorn."
Rockett Rimjob: "Right. Lettin' God solve all yer problems. Uh-huh."
"You better not be here ta goad me inta headin' home. Ain't happenin'."
"Aiiiin't happenin'."
Whitney G. Elieen: "She is the supreme problem solver."
Rockett Rimjob wags a finger.
Whitney G. Elieen: "And no. Not at all."
"There is no home to go back to but the one up in heaven."
Rockett Rimjob rolls her eyes.
Whitney G. Elieen: "They are gone."
Rockett Rimjob: "Ah heard."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Mother and father. Ascended. I have seen it with my own eyes. I did not see you however."
"I knew you were out here somewhere...I have tried to find you. The last time we spoke..."
Rockett Rimjob bites one of her cheeks.
Whitney G. Elieen lifts her hair up a bit, so as to show a rather nasty scar.
Whitney G. Elieen: "You did this."
Rockett Rimjob: "..."
Rockett Rimjob grits her teeth.
Cassie-May O'Brien put the mug back on the table with a clunk louder than intended.
Rockett Rimjob: "Ain't a mite close ta what Ah came ta you with."
Whitney G. Elieen sets the hair down
Rockett Rimjob: "An' if ya woulda cut tha googly Adventist hoo-hah fer five seconds Ah'd still be able ta read a

"Fuckin' bitch."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Your anger is understandable."
Rockett Rimjob spits onto Whitney's shoes, then she starts angrily digging into her pocket.

Whitney G. Elieen: "Father did so many terrible things...misguided. Born of love but expressed in such a terrible
way."
Rockett Rimjob: "Born o' love mah sorry ass."
Rockett Rimjob slaps a bill down on the table and flicks it over to the discarded beer bottles.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "..."
Rockett Rimjob looks at Cass.
Rockett Rimjob: "She ain't fuckin' with you, is she?"
"You marshals?"
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Now, simmer down a bit, y'all."
Cassie-May O'Brien held her hands up.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Ah got no idea y'all know each other up to now so don'cha unload whutever is between

Whitney G. Elieen looks on in silence
Whitney G. Elieen: "She is right you know"
"Do not burden strangers with asylum. I am right here...and now that I have found you I am not going anywhere."
Cassie-May O'Brien swung her legs over the seat and stood up.
Rockett Rimjob: "Ta hell you ain't. Ah ain't gonna spend five more seconds around you."
"Ah'll simmer down when Ah'm six feet under."
Whitney G. Elieen: "You can't run from me forever Judy..."

Rockett Rimjob pulls a cigar from her satchel, as well as a match, and proceeds to try and light the damn
thing up with desperation and anger.
Rockett Rimjob: "Don't fuckin' call me that!"
"An' you don't breathe a word of this!" she says, giving Cass a rather rude pointing-to before hurrying her way to
the stairs.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...uh...?"
Cassie-May O'Brien scratched her neck in confusion.
Rockett Rimjob puff puff puff

"She goes by another name now it seems."

Cassie-May O'Brien retrieved her coffee mug.
Rockett Rimjob: (lmao)
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...So, lemme guess an' correct me if Ah'm wrong here."
Cassie-May O'Brien took a sip.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Yer sisters."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Yes this is true."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Yer wuz yer dad's favourite while Rockett 'ere wuz at odds wit' him."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Dad beat me all the same. But less so. At the time faith, to me, was a way to live in peace."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "So, yew ran ta God while she ran away."
Whitney G. Elieen: "After throwing a rock at my head"
"And sending me into a two week long coma"
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Ah wuz' meanin' ta ask fer th' scar."
"Why'd she throw tha' rock? Wait... Yew tried ta stop her?"
"Or defend yer father?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "She came to me, crying...asking for support. I was flawed. Callous even. It was not that I did
not care but I was...unsure of how to help her."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Tha' explains how angry she wuz."
Whitney G. Elieen: "I tried to tell her how I get by. But I said it in a way that only pushed her away."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Mmm. Mighta wanted ta open wit' tha' instead of tellin' how God crossed yer paths. Mahbe
followed by "Ah'm sawrry Ah failed yew as a sister" or sumthin'..."
Cassie-May O'Brien sipped her coffee, then realized that her mug is dry with a groan.
Whitney G. Elieen: "But God did cross our paths."
"She said so herself."

Whitney G. Elieen: "Mother and father are in heaven. I know this because I have seen it myself."
"When I awoke from my coma after receiving my commandment...they were gone. Vanished."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Whuh?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "I did not see my sister however. I have been told from the highest of authorities that she was
roaming the earth."
"Lost and astray..."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Did yew see th' exact moment of yer parents flyin' up ta heaven in light an' glory?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "They were there when I arrived."
"It seemed like an instant...I was not aware it had been two weeks."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Ssso yew did? Or didn't?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "I didn't, no. They seemed to be already there when I arrived."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "So, all yew did actually see is, yer parents are there, rock, yer parents aren't there two
weeks later."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Yes...why do you suspect something?"
"Time in heaven works differently than time here."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Sugercube, yew ain' gunna like whut Ah gotta say, but from mah experience, a man tha
is beatin' his kids so hard tha' one runs away from home ta become a hooker ain' got no chariot-ride ta heaven in
glory."
Whitney G. Elieen: "In those two weeks...anything could happen. The beauty of God's grace is that it applies to
each and every one of us. It is our gift. Regardless of whether we deserve it. Forgiveness is ours if we so seek it."
"Perhaps in those two weeks...he finally did."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...So, Whitney, y'all seekin' Rockett's fergiveness, or th' other way 'round?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "It is especially hard for the pious to find salvation, believe it or not. The sick can only be
healed if they seek a doctor. I feel the experience of losing me and his other daughter may have set him on the
right path."
"I am seeking her own of course. She may have thrown a stone at me...but I hold no ill will towards that."
"I was wrong. Father was wrong. I want to try and make it right."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Welp. Y'all stay here an' think on yer phrasing, then, an' Ah'm gunna go talk ta her."

Rockett Rimjob: Nope. Stuff's just as it would be.
You do however hear some creaking floorboards just down the hall.

Rockett Rimjob: As well as some muffled moaning.

Cassie-May O'Brien: jokes aside, Strength is basically only used for melee damage.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Probably a good thing to consider, because she's going to be an up close fighter,

what's the deal with taking damage and having to succeed a roll or somethign

Rockett Rimjob: "but whitney's just a fatty"
dimVitrarius: Wind is the sorta kinda nonlethal damage
it's equal to your Spirit and Vigor dice combined
plus extras
Rockett Rimjob: I see
as in number of dice or dice type
dimVitrarius: Another thing to consider is Size
Dice type
Rockett Rimjob: o ok
so 16 is ok?
or
dimVitrarius: yeah, especially since you might later get it better
it's not that important actually
Rockett Rimjob: o ok
dimVitrarius: actual wounds are worse
also it'd be great to have Nev here becaus he knows this system inside out
anyway
Size
generally when you take actual damage, you compare it to the Size of your character
for every full increment, you get 1 point of wound
dimVitrarius: so if you got Size 6 and got rolled, say, 19 damage, it means 19/6 => 3 wounds
there are perks to make you bigger or smaller
smaller is bad because it's easier to hurt you
as a frontliner you might consider taking the same perk Whitney has
but that will come later
Rockett Rimjob: i like it how that's a term now
dimVitrarius: frontliner?
Rockett Rimjob: ye
so are perks the only thing that affect size
dimVitrarius: off the top of my head, yeah
another thing is armor
armor is either light or heavy
Cass got some light armor on her legs
light armor reduces amount of rolled damage you take
heavy armor reduces the amount of dice and their size

Basically, if you lack a certain skill, you can instead choose to roll the associated Trait Dice at a minimum of -4.
For instance, if an evil cultist throws some black magic at you that requires a Faith roll to resist, and you have no
faith, you would instead roll Spirit at a -4.
Let it be known that in this game, where almost all dice are Keep Highest, penalties and bonuses are really, really

Nevermore: I now have seven bounty points.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Groovy.
Nevermore: Oh, also.
Since I got y'all here.
Varmus never finished going over Wind, Stun, and Wounds.
I can do that now if y'all would like.
To make it short.
Wind is effectively how tired you are. Every time you get shot, run too hard, or use certain abilities, you take Wind
damage.
Nevermore: Stun is what happens whenever you get shot hard enough to take a wound, and instead of shooting
back, you spend your time cryin to mama over losing bits of your favorite anatomy.
Every time you take at least a light wound, you roll a Stun resist roll. Vigor roll against a TN of 5, plus 2 for each
wound level above Light, plus wound penalty.
So, if you took a Heavy wound (Two wound levels) to the arm, you would roll Vigor against TN7 at a -2 or lose all
actions.
And you keep losing all actions until you pass.
So get dunked on.
What's MORE.
Nevermore: Every time you take damage, you take 1d6 wind.
Any damage. Of any kind.
If you take 1 point of damage you roll 1d6.
Plus 1d6 for every wound level you suffered.
What's more.
If you took a Serious or heavier wound, you suffer Bleeding.
Nevermore: You take 1d6 wind every round even if you pass your stun resist and other rolls.
And you keep taking it until you pass out.
And keep taking it after you pass out.
You can die from this.
To make a very, very long story short.

whitney is

Nevermore: Basically.
Rockett Rimjob: shithouse
Nevermore: Okay, so, when you take damage, you divide it by your Size level.
All humans, with some exceptions, have a size of 6.
Rockett Rimjob: humen
Nevermore: Which means that you divide the damage by 6. Every whole number increment deals 1 wound.
All damage that doesn't deal a wound is ignored.
Whitney has a size of 8.
That's one point lower than the absolute theoretical maximum for humans
And the only way to get more is to be fat as fuck.
Is to be morbidly obese fat.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The only way to get more is to be Roadhog.
Nevermore: Basically.
Whitney G. Elieen: Whitney is as big as you can be
without being
a fatty
Nevermore: Whitney has more than a 50% chance to laugh off revolver rounds.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Whitney reads the SWOLLY BIBLE.
Rockett Rimjob: what else modifies size
Nevermore: While it is still recommended to be in cover, Whitney is more than capable of making charges and
surviving.
Nothing.
NOTHING modifies Size.
Rockett Rimjob: except fat
Nevermore: There are a grand total of THREE things that modify size.
Whitney G. Elieen: how does the armor add to this
Nevermore: The Fatty hindrance, the Brawny edge, and a certain ability only available to the Blessed, which
Whitney is.
Rockett Rimjob: oh
Nevermore: She gives up a power slot for it so it's still costly.
Anyways.
Armor helps more. Armor reduces incoming damage's dye type, if it's normal armor.

Unless you're Nephi and somehow pull out a 30 on the to-hit and an 18 on the location.
Did I mention that Nephi rolled effectively a triple-crit on the first boss?
He did 70 damage.
The boss only survived because the GM cashed in every chip he had.

Nevermore: Oh, that's another thing to cover, but first, your roll.
So you rolled a 3. Presumably you want to move that up two points.
Rockett Rimjob: ye
Nevermore: Which brings you up to 5, which is a shot to the lower guts, AKA the chest.
You want to hit the Gizzards or Noggin, because these give you bonus damage dice.
The Gizzards are at the 10, and the noggin is at the 20.
Gizzards for one bonus damage dice, Noggin for two.
Headshots also tend to be unarmored.
However, much like 6A, peeking from cover is indeed a thing.
Nevermore: It's ultimately the GM's decision as to whether a particular shot will be in cover or not.
Which is why interrupt actions are important!
Rockett Rimjob: how are range penalties handled
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Badly.
Nevermore: You have your gun's range increment then at a -2 for everything beyond that.
Considering that pistols have a range of 10 yards...
You're really almost never going to run into a problem.
Rockett Rimjob: mine has 3
Nevermore: Then yeah you might have problems.
Whitney G. Elieen: What do i have to roll again to punch
Nevermore: You roll fightin:Brawlin.
Rockett Rimjob: so if I shoot at someone 5 yards away
Nevermore: Then hit location plus a bonus I can't remember right now.
Rockett Rimjob: I suffer a -2
Nevermore: +3, I think.
Whitney G. Elieen: what if i do not
brawl
Rockett Rimjob: and if I shoot at someone 10 yards away
I suffer a -2
Whitney G. Elieen: i have a fightin of 3

You have to decide whether to cash them in or not.

Crystal Saint Claire: (Yes that.)

Cassie-May O'Brien: "Jus' breathe in through yer nose an' outta yer mouth. Deep breaths.
Whitney G. Elieen lessens her grip just a bit...
Crystal Saint Claire can breathe again...
Whitney G. Elieen: "Sorry...sometimes I forget myself."
Crystal Saint Claire hugs Whitney as tight as she can.
Crystal Saint Claire: *It feels like someone has wrapped a shoestring around your waist.

Cassie-May O'Brien: "One coulda thing yew two are sis-"
"...."
"Khrm."
Cassie-May O'Brien busied herself with the beer.
Crystal Saint Claire: "..."
Crystal Saint Claire blushes a little.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Whitney has taught me a lot about... things I did not learn in school."
"Such as bodily maintenance."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Beg yer pardon."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: (Insert masturbation joke here)
(Bye for now.)
Crystal Saint Claire: "Eat at least twice a day, try to sleep before midnight, that sort of thing."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Yes. I have been teaching her the ways of healthy living."
Crystal Saint Claire: (Wait doc)
(We need a Nephi Token just in case.)
Whitney G. Elieen: "She has even been excercising with me in the morning!"
Crystal Saint Claire nods.
Whitney G. Elieen: "She has such a sharp mind already...a sharp body can only do her good."
Crystal Saint Claire: "I can do eight push-ups!"
Whitney G. Elieen: "Lord be praised! She smiles down on your efforts."
Crystal Saint Claire: "..."
"That is new."
"Typically I have only heard you use male pronouns in reference to the Lord."
"Lord is, in fact, a male title, no?"
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Ah know, righ'? It's God Father..."
Cassie-May O'Brien smirked at Whitney.
Whitney G. Elieen: "Indeed. The result of a male dominated culture which helped to shape our earthly church.
Paltry when compared to the true majesty of God."
"A majesty that can be ill defined by such strict binaries. God is he. She is also she. They are so much more."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: (I already did a Nephi Token)
Whitney G. Elieen smiles right back
Wonderful Cowboy Land: (Just assume I'm a step ahead all the time.)

Crystal Saint Claire: "That is a nice way to look at it."
Cassie-May O'Brien shrugged.
Crystal Saint Claire: (I will do no such thing. If I assume you are a step behind, I will be pleasantly surprised.)
(Or, better still, I will be right.)
Whitney G. Elieen: "I had the good fortune of seeing and speaking with her myself. You would be surprised. Far
from the vision of an earthly middle aged man with greying hair."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Ah suppose it doesn' matter. It's not like Ah'm gunna ever git interested in whutever th'
Almighty got between 'em legs."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: (Have you been right so far?)
Crystal Saint Claire: (Once, maybe twice.)
"If we meet any ranking officials of the church... I feel they may not appreciate this conversation."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Indeed. For God the father is vast and powerful. What resides in between is...an interesting
speculation. But meaningless to her true message."
"And I would not be the first who ran afoul of the Pharisee"
"Jesus in his time was quite the rebel. He spoke the truth of God's love and was hated for it."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Ah liked tha' part when he grabbed a rope an' went an' smacked merchants outta church."
Crystal Saint Claire: "...But Jesus got back up after they killed him. I do not want to test if you are similarly...
endowed."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Matthew 21-12. I always enjoyed that one. It shows a more human Jesus, who was so
frustrated by the perversion of God's message that he had to grab a rope and lead them out."
Whitney G. Elieen squeezes, though only slightly so
Whitney G. Elieen: "Do not worry Crystal...I can't speak for God's plan but I can guess she has more in store for
me yet. I am not going anywhere..."
Crystal Saint Claire: "...I hope not..."
"Otherwise, I... am still confident I will be consigned to oblivion..."
Whitney G. Elieen: "You are already walking the right path Crystal. God loves you. And so do I."
"I won't be leaving you. Not if I have any say."
Crystal Saint Claire freezes.
Cassie-May O'Brien coughs into her fist.

Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Guess tha's anuther name fer common sense, hyuk."

Whitney G. Elieen: "Far too many have falling prey to the drink. It has robbed them of their better senses, it adds

"But one beer so that my sister may talk with me is acceptable."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Sure does."

Cassie-May O'Brien stood up from the table...
Rockett Rimjob is quite ragged, her bonnet skewed to one side and bent, hair a mess over her bare
shoulders. Her dress is disheveled, and her countenance worn but... still angry, somehow/ You can smell
her sin from halfway across the room.

Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Welp, sugercube. Thought Ah coulda grab a small talk wit' yew before y'all go do

Rockett Rimjob: "Neat."
"Now if you'll excuse me."
Rockett Rimjob motions for Cass to scoot her boot.
Rockett Rimjob clearly does not give a single fuck about Whitney's wants.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Look, sugercube. Ain' gonna knock yer heads tagether an' make yew kiss, but... yer both

Rockett Rimjob: "She's as much family ta me as a cow is to a horse. Ain't a chance in hell Ah'm givin' her tha

Rockett Rimjob shimmies her britches back up to her waist, gets them comfortable, and starts marching
onward.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Wit' how yew two stubborn are, Ah'd guess yer both mules."

Rockett Rimjob clenches her fist. "Damn right Ah'm stubborn. Ah got it from pa. Sure Whitney already told

Rockett Rimjob: "Ah'll dunk yer fuckin' head, just you wait," she grumbles under her breath as she heads out the

"Yew two are gunna keep sittin'?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "I did not ask where you knew she would be, O'Brien."
Crystal Saint Claire stands. She actually gets a bit shorter, standing.
Crystal Saint Claire: "I asked for a guess."
"I... sort of want to try talking to her."
Cassie-May O'Brien blink blinked, then spread her arms.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "How the fuck would Ah know? Ah don't know this city or where her favourite spots are,

Rockett Rimjob: You hear an incredibly loud gunshot in the distance.
Crystal Saint Claire: "...I think I can guess now."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Tha's her."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "..."
Cassie-May O'Brien ran out in the direction of the gunshot!
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Should we be worried about that?"

Nephi "Longiron" Delano: Sigh
Crystal Saint Claire reaches into her bag, pulling out a little red shotshell and loading it into the Opus.
Crystal Saint Claire: "I hope she's okay..."
Yuppie b.: *brb sorry
Rockett Rimjob: South. You head south, not far out of town, just past a cowhouse. As you get closer, you see a
bunch of bottles set up on the fence posts. One of them is quite shattered.
Rockett is standing on the other side of the dirt road.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "..."

Rockett Rimjob: "..."
Rockett Rimjob turns to face the group.
Cassie-May O'Brien puts the rifle on her shoulder and pushes her stetson up a bit.
Rockett Rimjob looks at Crystal as she moves.
Rockett Rimjob: "...y'all ain't gonna let this go, are ya."
Crystal Saint Claire: "...can you teach me to shoot? I have a gun, but... Little skill using it."
Rockett Rimjob: "Not with this thang."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Sug, Ah told yew, Ah ain' gunna bonk yer heads tagether an' make yew kiss. But Whitney's

Rockett Rimjob has an oversized, fancy-ass derringer dangling in her hand, pointed at the ground.
Crystal Saint Claire: "..."
Crystal Saint Claire stares at the weapon.
Cassie-May O'Brien lowered her rifle and loaded a new bullet into the mag.
Rockett Rimjob: "...tell ya what."
"You hit a bottle with this piece o' mine, an' maybe Ah'll give ya tha time'a day," she says, staring at Cass.
Cassie-May O'Brien blink-blinked.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Fahne."
Cassie-May O'Brien has a wiry frame and thin wrists. She ain't gonna have hands after shooting this thing
barring a miracle.
Rockett Rimjob cracks her derringer open, and pulls out the lone shell loaded inside. Then, she pulls a
bullet out of her pocket. Said bullet is three inches long and some change.
Cassie-May O'Brien seems to realize that, given the look on her face.
Rockett Rimjob: It's not too much smaller than the bullets used in Nephi's rifle, for reference.
Crystal Saint Claire: "That is a large Derringer..."
"Who made it?"
Rockett Rimjob: "Bond Arms. Houston."
Cassie-May O'Brien extended her hand to Rockett for the derringer.

Rockett Rimjob twirls it around a bit for kicks, then holds it out to Cass.
Rockett Rimjob holds out the bullet with her other hand.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Do you have schematics? Anything? It looks fascinating..."
Rockett Rimjob: "Can't say Ah do."
Cassie-May O'Brien grabs it and inspects for a moment, then steels herself with a sigh.
Crystal Saint Claire: "...May I take a look at it later?"
Cassie-May O'Brien turns to the bottles.
Rockett Rimjob: "Long as ya don't take it apart.
Crystal Saint Claire: "...Would you like to see mine?"
Rockett Rimjob: "Cass, use both hands. Grip tha everlovin' hell out of it, too, ya string bean."
Cassie-May O'Brien tries to steady and secure the little hellion as tightly as she can in the bend of her
other arm.
Cassie-May O'Brien leans forward on her legs, hoping to take at least some of the recoil into shifting her
weight back.
Cassie-May O'Brien takes careful aim at the bottle...
Cassie-May O'Brien: BANG!!!
Rockett Rimjob smiles
Cassie-May O'Brien: Doc, what should I roll again?
Rockett Rimjob: First it's a Strength roll, target 8. Then it's a Shootin' roll for Pistols.

Cassie-May O'Brien grinned, flexing her now fixed wrist.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Much apprecciated."
Whitney G. Elieen grimmaces for a moment
Crystal Saint Claire winces, watching Whitney.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Yer good?"
Rockett Rimjob: he's helping trick or treaters.
Whitney G. Elieen pulls her hand back and grasps it
Cassie-May O'Brien: I know, just being an ass here.
Crystal Saint Claire moves closer to Whitney. "I might have something to make the pain a little less..."
Whitney G. Elieen takes in a deep breath
Whitney G. Elieen slowly lets it out
Crystal Saint Claire: "painful..."
Whitney G. Elieen: "The pain is only temporary..."
"And a fair trade for what it can do."

Whitney G. Elieen: "Go with God Cassie."
Whitney G. Elieen relaxes her hand
Crystal Saint Claire reaches into her bag and pulls out the Armored Vest she made for Whitney.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Ah owe yew a favour, sugercube."
Crystal Saint Claire: "...here."
Rockett Rimjob doesn't seem to be paying attention.
Cassie-May O'Brien looks over to Rockett.
Rockett Rimjob still wants nothing to do with Whitney.
Crystal Saint Claire: "...Just... just in case."
Crystal Saint Claire is holding it out.
Whitney G. Elieen: "...hmmm?" She looks to the armor with a smile. "The vest...it is ready?"
Crystal Saint Claire nods.
Whitney G. Elieen: "Oh Crystal...thank you so much."
Whitney G. Elieen grabs it.
Crystal Saint Claire: "I made it green."
Whitney G. Elieen sets it down next to her
Whitney G. Elieen reaches forward and hugs
Crystal Saint Claire stiffens for a moment, then returns hugs.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Welp, Rockett, them's still a few beers left. Help yerself.
Whitney G. Elieen: "God bless you, my friend. Thank you for this mighty vestment."
Crystal Saint Claire: "P-please warn me... just... a second or two in advance..."
Cassie-May O'Brien pointed on the table behind her.
Rockett Rimjob: "Ah think Ah've had enough drink."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Is that truly so?"
"Or do you just not wish to drink with me around."
Crystal Saint Claire: "It's like watching a bear come down on your head..."
Cassie-May O'Brien pulled her glove off and flexed her now unbroken hand for a moment, then put the
glove back on.
Rockett Rimjob: "What part of you doubts that Ah'd have a drink if Ah wanned to, whether or not Ah had yer

Whitney G. Elieen: "Only fair I suppose...are there any other injuries that need healing?"
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Ah think naw."
Whitney G. Elieen: "...and yes. If you would have it."
"If this would have you sit and talk with me."
Rockett Rimjob: "Ass is kinda sore, so Ah ain't sittin' fer a spell. But fahne."

"Don't think fer a second Ah'm doin' this fer you, Elieen."
Whitney G. Elieen: "I never thought so to begin with Sister."
Cassie-May O'Brien grabbed herself a beer.
Cassie-May O'Brien took a long swig.
Whitney G. Elieen: "Cassie...please." She says as she produces some cash. "Buy my sister a drink. And bring
me another water if you would."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Can do."
Whitney G. Elieen: "For what it is worth I am sorry Sister. I have been for a long time. Ever since I woke up from
the injury you gave me."
Whitney G. Elieen hands the monez
Whitney G. Elieen: "Bless you."
Cassie-May O'Brien took the cash, then walked to the bartender.
Cassie-May O'Brien returned shortly with a water for Whitney and what appeared to be whiskey on the
rocks for Rockett.
Rockett Rimjob stares flatly at Cass. "When Ah said Ah wasn't thirsty no more, Ah meant it."
Cassie-May O'Brien shrugs.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Fair enough. Yew two mind if in that case Ah...?
Cassie-May O'Brien gestured to the whiskey.
Whitney G. Elieen: "I do not mind in the slightest."
Rockett Rimjob: "Ain't mah whiskey."

Whitney G. Elieen: "You know I did not mean to hurt you sister."
Cassie-May O'Brien sipped the whiskey instead, leaning on the table.
Whitney G. Elieen: "I know you will not listen to what I have to say but this is the truth."
Rockett Rimjob stares at Whitney, arms crossed. She stays silent and waits for her to continue, not
offering a single word.
Whitney G. Elieen: "I was callous. I was a child and I had a child's understanding."
Rockett Rimjob taps one of her fingers against her covered bicep.
Whitney G. Elieen: "I was wrong. Father was wrong. My transgressions against you pushed you away."
"Maybe someday you will forgive me. But It will not stop me from trying to make it right in the meanwhile."
"You still have the scars...don't you."
Rockett Rimjob: "Why d'you think Ah grew mah hair out?" she says coldly.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "..."
Whitney G. Elieen reaches her hand over
Cassie-May O'Brien knocked the whiskey in one go.

Whitney G. Elieen turns away, but does not walk away
Crystal Saint Claire moves a little closer to Whitney.
Cassie-May O'Brien still tries to shield Rockett with her own body.
Cassie-May O'Brien realizes that both women could probably tie her into a pretzel if needed.
Cassie-May O'Brien does her best not to smile at the ridiculousness of it.
Crystal Saint Claire just silently reaches towards Whitney's hand.

Rockett Rimjob: "...much as Ah wanna punch somethin' right now."
"Ain't gonna punch you."
Whitney G. Elieen: "God...give me a sign. I am so lost..."
Rockett Rimjob unclenches her fist, and reaches out to give Cassie a light, toying slap on her cheek
before walking on.
Whitney G. Elieen looks up to the celling

Cassie-May O'Brien rubbed her cheek, confused.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "..So, means yer comin' ta Dodge wit' us, or...?"
Rockett Rimjob: It was hardly a slap. If there was any pain at all, it was gone in an instant.
Whitney G. Elieen: "How do I reach her? How do I save her? How do I even speak with her?"
Rockett Rimjob: "Yeah. Ah got a score ta settle with Mitchell, so either way."

"You all right?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "...to try and draw it would be..."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Eeeyup. Righ' as new."
Cassie-May O'Brien flexed her wrist.
Whitney G. Elieen: "Well...like you trying to explain your degree to me."
Whitney G. Elieen says with a chuckle
Whitney G. Elieen: "But...but I can try."
"It can be hard though. The colors of heaven are not the colors of earth."
Crystal Saint Claire: "And the blueprints I draw are never what I see in my mind."
Rockett Rimjob: "Good. Woulda felt like shit if ya had ta deal with that fer too long."
Crystal Saint Claire: "It is about accepting that things need not be perfect."
Whitney G. Elieen: "..."
Whitney G. Elieen sighs
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Aw, shucks. So yew like meh after all!"
Crystal Saint Claire: "I would rather have a good invention finished... Than a perfect one that I never realize."
"Because one can change things."
Rockett Rimjob: "If yer wrist's broken you'd have ta tickle me with yer lame hand."
Whitney G. Elieen: "I feel the wisdom of God speaking through you..."
"I am just too weak to comprehend it just yet."
Crystal Saint Claire: ""That's fine! Just comprehend a little of it!"
Whitney G. Elieen: "I try and reach as many as I can...in the only way I know. With a power that is leant to me

Whitney G. Elieen: "And it is a most perfect power. Failed only by this vessel."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Finish comprehending the little bit, and maybe next time you can get a little more!"
Rockett Rimjob smirks
Cassie-May O'Brien smacked Rockett's shoulder.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Ah coulda put mah boot up yer arse!"
Crystal Saint Claire: "Rome was not built in a day."
Rockett Rimjob: "It'd get stuck."
Rockett Rimjob chuckles as she stumbles to the side

Rockett Rimjob: "Then you'd be out a perfectly good boot."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Fuck naw, Ah'd jus' wear yew."
Whitney G. Elieen: "...I am blessed to know you"
Whitney G. Elieen reaches her hand over
Whitney G. Elieen rubs her eyes a bit, as gently as she could.
Rockett Rimjob: "Then you'd have tha sexiest boot this side of the Mississippi."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "An' th' snarkiest. Tha'd make heads turn."
Whitney G. Elieen: "You are an engineer. I am a servent of the greatest engineer of all."
"Together we can solve this problem."
Rockett Rimjob: "Makin' heads turn is mah business."

Crystal Saint Claire: "Together, we can do anything, probably."

Cassie-May O'Brien: "Sure is thick enough! Them's un' problem wit' tha'."
Crystal Saint Claire: "It will not require determination, or strength... or... some... third thing..."
Whitney G. Elieen: "But to follow in the example of christ I will keep at it. Even if she would put me up on a

Crystal Saint Claire: "It will require care, and tenderness, and, occasionally, it will take doing nothing."
Rockett Rimjob: "You wouldn't wanna wreck mah pretty face?"

Whitney G. Elieen: "Most men are intimidated by my size. Most women do not pay a glance ether. In fact I was
unsure of myself until I had gotten my answer..."
"Crystal. A question."
"Why?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "...why?"
Rockett Rimjob: "Some folks say it's jus' sex. That's true, sorta. Nothin' wrong with it."
Cassie-May O'Brien looked up at Rockett.
Whitney G. Elieen: "I am not remarkable. My power is borrowed."
"Most consider me insane...or unapproachable."
Rockett Rimjob: "But it don't matter how much ya try ta make it 'jus' sex' -- it ain't gonna change how ya grab on
to 'em, how ya feel 'em up, how ya look at 'em, how ya breathe, how ya move, how ya speak to 'em..."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Both sometimes."

"Ah think it's sorta like bein' a nurse. Only you ain't mendin' wounds -- yer helpin' some poor sod detox. Destress.
Stop feelin' lonely fer a spell."
Crystal Saint Claire: "...for many reasons. I find you beautiful. I enjoy your company. You talk with me, and try to
understand rather than write me off as some child genius sideshow. But... I think the most important thing is...
what you said. What you say."
Rockett Rimjob: "Folks can call me a slut all they like. Ah think it's a noble profession."
"...pay ain't too bad at all, neither."
Rockett Rimjob digs into her bag and pulls out a light cigar.
Crystal Saint Claire: "It would be easy to love you because you are strong, or because you have... the abilities
you do."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Yer sellin' companionship an' closeness. Ain' somethin' found often
'ere in th' West. Nawt ta feel lonely, if jus' fer a moment."
"...Sex ain' too bad at all, neither?"
Cassie-May O'Brien smiled at Rockett.
Crystal Saint Claire: "...but you don't act like that. Like... like everyone is supposed to love you, because you are
who you are."
Rockett Rimjob scoffs a bit. "Depends on tha customer."
Rockett Rimjob: "Depends on what they want. How much they wanna be in control."
Crystal Saint Claire: "It is difficult to explain..."
Rockett Rimjob: "An' how much they know 'bout what they're doin'."
Crystal Saint Claire: "You are not, alone, remarkable."
Rockett Rimjob: "Ya'd think detectives 're rarer'n albino bison with how few of those poor bastards can't find yer

Crystal Saint Claire: "Nobody really is, are they?"
"Anyone who is remarkable has had help. And time."
Whitney G. Elieen: "My sister...is remarkable. Nephi is remarkable. You Crystal...you are remarkable."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Bahah! Well, us gals are a lil' more complicated than 'em. Ain' much ta do 'round a pecker,

Whitney G. Elieen: "The very best help of all. Without her...I am nothing."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Alone, without anyone's influence... You would be average, and I would be dead."

Crystal Saint Claire: "But you understand that. You don't act like... like the remarkability is yours and yours
alone."
"...I love you because... b-because..."
"..."
"I cannot explain."
Cassie-May O'Brien put her hands in her pockets again and kicked another pebble.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Ah wouldn' know."
Whitney G. Elieen: "...like trying to explain heaven."
Whitney G. Elieen chuckles
Crystal Saint Claire: "There are things that cannot be explained."
"Love. Music. Humor. Religion."
Whitney G. Elieen: "You end up sounding like a fool."
"Speaking of greater things."
Crystal Saint Claire: "You cannot explain them without using them as reference, or else they fall apart."
Rockett Rimjob: "Take it you've never tango'd before?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "But the point is not to explain them."
"The point is the trying."
"Professor Cecil always said that if you give someone an answer, then they have an answer."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Hah! Naw, Ah ain' tha innocent. Jus' didn' have many. Them's been Joey... Hah! We both
had naw idea whut we wuz doin'. Paw caught us in th' barn."
Crystal Saint Claire: "But if you give them a question, they will find their own answers, and those will be so much
more precious to them."
Crystal Saint Claire is speaking unusally clearly, no trace of her usual muttering and mumbling.
Whitney G. Elieen: "My sabbath school teacher used to say that!"
Crystal Saint Claire: "So... the reason I love you... is because I love you. Right now, that is all I can say."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Chased th' poor boy wit' a pitchfork while he tried ta put his pants on... Ah jus' yelled at 'im
ta stop an' started throwin' potatoes at mah Paw there."
Whitney G. Elieen: "And I say this to you Crystal...your reason is reason enough to me."
"Beyond the love of God...it has been a long time since anyone has said that to me."
"Not since...mother actually. My sister loved me once. Father did as well. In his own flawed way."
Rockett Rimjob chuckles at that, shaking her head as she lights up her cigar. "Sounds about right. It's
funny. Lotsa paws out there do it 'cause their angry, but some of 'em don't even do it 'cause they're
worried or upset. Lot of 'em know their daughter's grown, an' that this is inevitable. They jus' wanna have
a story ta tell an' somethin' ta laugh at later. Like it's a tradition."
Rockett Rimjob: "...it ain't a safe gamble ta call any bluffs, though. Ah know Ah'd be runnin' if Ah was some poor
jackass with his pants around his ankles an' a pitchfork at his back."

"Ah'm gonna hang out here for a while, finish this cigar."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Perhaps one of these days i shall get you fabric?"

Rockett Rimjob: "G'night, darlin'."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano catches up to Crystal and Whitney, clearly something on his mind.
Whitney G. Elieen: "Hmmmm..."
"Something tells me it will be a much different dress then what my mother would make..."
Whitney G. Elieen looks over to the approaching Nephi
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Yer free ta wake meh up wit' coffee an' breakfast in bed!"

Whitney G. Elieen: "Ah. Nephi. Welcome."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Hello, Delano!"
Whitney G. Elieen: "...does something trouble you child?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Just got done mailin a letter."
Whitney G. Elieen: Goodnight Varm!

"And that's what I'm worried about. It could just be the usual mail gremlins, y'know...":
"Or something happened."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Do you know where he would be in dodge?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Probably wherever you find the boys in blue crashing for the night."
"...Just feels weird. First time in a long time he hasn't written me back."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Well... maybe we can send the Union Railroad office a letter asking about the well-being of
your brother?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "I get a... Lotta mail."
Whitney G. Elieen: "We should go. To check up on him."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Tell them you are concerned, as he usually writes you back..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "I will. Still, got mail from some of the others though."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Though he shall be in my prayers, I feel you need more than just a comforting message to
the all mighty to sooth your mind."
"Mail from others?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "Who are the others?"

Nephi "Longiron" Delano fishes through a pouch on his belt, and pulls out a big picture featuring a...
Ohhoh. Oh wow. Is that Nephi, there, with the oversized hat, horribly fitting clothes, and buckteeth?

Crystal Saint Claire: "Did you grow into the hat as well?"
Whitney G. Elieen: God
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: The picture is clearly several years old. Four boys, four girls.
Crystal Saint Claire: "...is that the same hat you're wearing now?"
Whitney G. Elieen picks Crystal up from her shoulders and places her down on the ground
Crystal Saint Claire stands there.
Whitney G. Elieen: "Nephi if you do not mind watching Crystal for a moment?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "..."
"Is something wrong?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: Two parents, it seems. One of them is wearing a mystery substance-stained oncewhite lab coat, and the other looks every bit... Like Cassie, almost. but quite a bit older. Trail-worn and hard, but
better rested.
Whitney G. Elieen: "No. Everything is fine." She says with the biggest, most awkward grin on her otherwise pretty
face.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Yeah sure.
"And yeah, it is."
Crystal Saint Claire: "You only say it like that when things are not fine"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Alma's hat. He's the oldest."
Crystal Saint Claire: "I am worried now."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Pa gave it to him, he gave it to me when he went to work with the railroad."
Whitney G. Elieen: "I just...need a walk is all. A little time alone to pray."
"I promise I will be back right quick"
Crystal Saint Claire: "Okay!"
Whitney G. Elieen: "And we can go to the store together."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Alma's that one. The guy the size of Whitney."
Whitney G. Elieen gives Crystal a hug
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has completely lost track of the other two and is just reminiscing.
Crystal Saint Claire returns the hug without her usual hesitation.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is using that same voice that parents use when talking about their kids.
Whitney G. Elieen: "I will be back in a moment...do keep an eye on her."

Crystal Saint Claire leans closer to Nephi.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "The one with the big scar on her head."

Whitney G. Elieen steps out and walks off
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "She's real self-conscious about it."

"...did she hit her head..?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Shooting accident."
Crystal Saint Claire: "...oh, dear."
"It is fortunate she was not permanently damaged..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Ma insisted we all learn how to shoot, in case the Mormon Hunters came round
again."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Wait."
"The what"
Rockett Rimjob: lolololo
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Ma didn't say. She just said there were bad folks that would want to hunt us."
"So everyone in my family learned how to shoot rifles from the time we were big enough to hold em."
Crystal Saint Claire: "...and your mother was worried they would come BACK."
"So... that means they had been there before?"
"Who hunts mormons!?"
"That's like... I don't know, hunting crows!"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Y'think I asked? She's a tough lady who doesn't take any lip."
Crystal Saint Claire: "There's not much benefit to hunting them..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Back when the church was founded, there was a lot of killings."
Crystal Saint Claire: "And exterminating them just isn't going to happen."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Governor of Missouri signed an order that every mormon would be put to death."
Crystal Saint Claire: "That... sounds..."

Yuppie b.: bo[
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Whitney, in her endless benevolence, decides to pay a visit to the clinic where Doc
Mitchell worked. With the lack of the proprietor, there must be a need for someone with healing expertise, and
Whitney does serve the Great Physician.
The door opens with a creak and she can see a few individuals laid out on beds. There is no nurse present, but
the injured appear to have been given basic care.
They all need more than that.
Whitney G. Elieen makes her way inside, step after thunderous step. Frowning in pure and utter concern
for those in need.
Whitney G. Elieen: "Hello all of you...who is the caretaker? I had heard the doctor had taken off."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Several of them stop moving when they hear Whitney's voice. She can see one with
no leg and bandages covering his head. There is another next to him with a heavily wrapped torso. Both push
themselves away from Whitney as they realize who she is, muttering fearfully as they do.
(pause, I need to go do something)
(sorry)
Whitney G. Elieen: (It is quite alright)
"You do not need to be frightened..." She speaks, in her ever soft and soothing voice. "I have come to provide
whatever comfort and aid I can give that is within my power to give you."

Crystal Saint Claire: "I will not tell any of you that you will make a full recovery."
"But, hopefully, none of you will die after this."
"From there, progress can be made."

shuddering in pain as it takes on form and life again.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: There is pain Whitney, and there is hell. Hell is your left leg. The pain does not
subside as normal. It continues. The bandages on the man's leg move slow, almost imperceptible. There is
healing, but it is slow.

reprieve from the terrible pain she took upon herself...
Bandit Leadslinger: "..."
"Get her outta here."
"To decent bed."
"We'll be fine."
Whitney G. Elieen is still and lifeless...

Doc (GM): Almost home.
Gimme twenty minutes to get settled
Whitney G. Elieen: kk
I will be right back myself

Crystal Saint Claire: ok

Crystal Saint Claire is trying to drag someone easily thrice her weight. It's... pretty clearly not happening.
Crystal Saint Claire: As such, there's really only one option available to her.
Crystal Saint Claire takes a deep breath
Crystal Saint Claire: "..."
Crystal Saint Claire screams as loud as she can.
Crystal Saint Claire: (D'you think it'd carry to the others from here?)
Whitney G. Elieen: :,,,
Perhaps she should go and get help!
But that is just my OCC suggestion. Whitney is out like a rock I fear...
Healed Bandit pushes himself out of the bed. He peers at his unfamiliar leg as it makes the rapid and
unnatural recovery that should be impossible. He swings himself off the bed and tests the new leg. It
holds his weight.
Crystal Saint Claire: She's screaming for help.
Something along the lines of
Healed Bandit takes a second to find his balance with the footless leg, then walks over to Whitney.
Crystal Saint Claire: "SOMEBODY HELP"
Healed Bandit: "...here."
"Help me get her upright."
Crystal Saint Claire: "..."
Crystal Saint Claire tries
Crystal Saint Claire: "I am... very, very weak."
"Can you... walk?"
Healed Bandit pulls a crutch off the bed and jams one end of it under his right arm. He bends down with
as much as he can and grabs the back of Whitney's dress.

Healed Bandit manages to leverage enough strength to yank Whitney up. He drapes one arm of hers
across his shoulders and pulls her to his side.
Crystal Saint Claire: "...Where... do we..."
"The inn."
"...Or the general store. Mr. Bean can help."
"Yes."
Healed Bandit gets Whitney situated to where he can move her.
Healed Bandit: "Go."
Healed Bandit nods to himself.
Crystal Saint Claire: "..Do you know how to get there?"
Healed Bandit: "Follow."
Crystal Saint Claire: "..."
Crystal Saint Claire starts walking.
Crystal Saint Claire has to stop a few times, to get her bearings...
Crystal Saint Claire: Any rolls?
To get there?
Healed Bandit makes his slow way in the wake of Crystal's path. Leaning on the crutch as he swings
himself and Whitney forward, putting weight on his good leg, and going through the action again.
Healed Bandit: (narp)
Crystal Saint Claire: When they do arrive... Is anyone there?
Healed Bandit: (Arrive to which spot?
Crystal Saint Claire: (The General Store.)

Crystal Saint Claire is holding back tears.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: It takes a half hour for the party to get to the General store with the pace they must
hold.
The owner, Mister Bean, is sitting in his chair when Crystal first sees him.
Crystal Saint Claire sprints towards him.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: He has the door open for them when he sees the man struggling along with Whitney.
General Store Owner: "What's going on?"
Crystal Saint Claire almost immediately starts blurting out an almost indecipherable description of the
events.
Crystal Saint Claire:
"Whitney'nIwentovertodoctortohelpwithpatientsandshetriedtohealoneandithurtherbutshetriedagainandthenshejustf

General Store Owner keeps his eyes locked on Crystal as she explains matters. His eyes do not widen
and his brows do not raise. He does look up near the tail end of the explanation to look at Whitney and the
man with the peculiar pristine foot.
General Store Owner: "Wait."
"Be back."
Crystal Saint Claire just nods.
General Store Owner creaks off on the floorboards of the general store towards the back end and grabs
an unlabeled jar from a shelf whose contents do not appear to be for sale.
Crystal Saint Claire then slowly sits on the ground... tucks her knees to her chest... and starts crying like
the little girl she is.
General Store Owner catches sight of Crystal on his way back and makes a slight detour. Bean is back
moments later.
General Store Owner: "Here."
General Store Owner he presses a long stick wrapped in crinkling paper into Crystal's hands.
General Store Owner: "Make you feel better."
Crystal Saint Claire: "..."
General Store Owner walks over to Whitney.
Crystal Saint Claire reflexively receives it.
Healed Bandit stands as still as he can in the presence of Mr. Bean.
General Store Owner unscrews the lid on the jar. There is a slight pop, and the smell becomes evident to
the entire room.
General Store Owner: Guts roll.

You don't puke.
But it is close.
General Store Owner holds the jar under Whitney's nose.
(To Yuppie b.): Whitney, something breaks through into the dreamless slumber with the force of a pickaxe on a
stained glass window.

Whitney G. Elieen opens her eyes slowly...
Crystal Saint Claire is still sobbing, curled up a few feet away.
Whitney G. Elieen tries her best to pull herself up
Whitney G. Elieen stumbles up onto her feet...almost falling as she puts weight upon her left foot
Whitney G. Elieen: "...where am I?"
Crystal Saint Claire almost TACKLES Whitney, still sobbing incoherently.

Whitney G. Elieen places a hand up to her head and rubs...doing her best to smile through the still
considerable pain
General Store Owner leaves Crystal and the former bandit to take care of things as he replaces the jar.
Whitney G. Elieen: "..!"
Crystal Saint Claire: Granted, she pretty much bounces off, but
Healed Bandit immediately loses balance and topples to the floor.
Healed Bandit: *"Shitshitshitshitshit."
Whitney G. Elieen: "..."
"Is everything alright...?"
Whitney G. Elieen says as she strokes at Crystal's hair
Whitney G. Elieen: "Shhh shhhh..."
Crystal Saint Claire is alternating between crying gibberish and futile pummeling.
Whitney G. Elieen: "Your leg will be stiff and sore for a time..."
"Be careful. Do not strain yourself."
Crystal Saint Claire: "N'iff y'ever overexten yerself loik tha' again oi sware oi'll- oi'll"
Crystal Saint Claire goes back into crying.
Whitney G. Elieen makes her way over, limping as she does
Healed Bandit: "Right."
"Yeah."
Crystal Saint Claire is still attached to Whitney
Healed Bandit: "I'll...be careful."
Whitney G. Elieen: "..your friend?"
"What was the matter with him?"
Healed Bandit: "Who?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "The other."
"There were bandages over his chest..."

Whitney G. Elieen takes a deep breath
Whitney G. Elieen: "...my work is not done."
Crystal Saint Claire: "I c-can..."
Healed Bandit pushes himself up to a sitting position.
Crystal Saint Claire: "I c-can help him... t-to give you time... to get b-better..."
Healed Bandit: "He'll be fine."
"Said so."
"He weren't lying."
"Nurse'll take care of him."
Whitney G. Elieen: "...are you certain?"
"I can heal him..."
Healed Bandit: "No need."
Whitney G. Elieen takes another step forward, almost stumbling again as she does
Whitney G. Elieen: "...I told you I would not preach to you. But remember what had happened...and put this to
good use."
"I will pray for you both..."
Whitney G. Elieen looks down at Crystal.
Crystal Saint Claire has her face buried in Whitney's dress, and is still trembling...
Whitney G. Elieen: "Thank you for bringing me here." She looks over to the store owner. "And thank you for
reviving me..."
Crystal Saint Claire: "please..."
"d-don't go..."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Child...I am not going anywhere."
Healed Bandit: "Don't mention it."
General Store Owner leans against one of the shelves of the store.
Whitney G. Elieen squeezes you with a noticeably weaker grip
General Store Owner: "Welcome."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Both of you. All three of you. God bless..."
Crystal Saint Claire: "You... sh-should rest."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Shall we go back to the inn then?"
"I feel the need to...sit..."

Crystal Saint Claire nods.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Do you have... crutches?"
Crystal Saint Claire looks to Bean.
Whitney G. Elieen: "There is no need..."
Crystal Saint Claire: "If you fall, I will not be able to pick you up."
Whitney G. Elieen: "I dare not take a crutch away from one who could truly use it..."
Crystal Saint Claire: "We can borrow them."
Whitney G. Elieen said as she limps her way to the door
Healed Bandit: "I...don't think I need this one."
Whitney G. Elieen: "..."
Healed Bandit slides the crutch he used on the way over to Whitney. He gets up from the floor, a little
shaky, but his new leg serves him well.
Whitney G. Elieen slowly lowers herself down and grabs the crutch
Whitney G. Elieen: "God bless you sir..."
Healed Bandit: "..."
"Seems to have done that already."
Whitney G. Elieen: "What is your name sir?"
"If you do not mind me asking..."
Healed Bandit: "Jon."
Whitney G. Elieen: "You will be in my prayers Jon."
Healed Bandit: "Thanks."
"Keep the others in there too."
Whitney G. Elieen: "I promise..."
"Now come along Crystal."
"Rest with me."
Whitney G. Elieen hobbles her way over to the door, as slowly as she can.
Crystal Saint Claire: "..."
Crystal Saint Claire accompanies her, not letting go for a moment.
Healed Bandit stays standing for a moment, lost in thought. He heads out of the door in the direction
opposite Crystal and Whitney two minutes later.
Whitney G. Elieen: I think from here...we can take this to discord. Would this count as a conversion Doc? There
are special mechanics for that.

In the lantern light.
Outside there's a moon hanging in the sky.

Whitney G. Elieen: No not yet. Though i have the chips for that i believe.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: AFAIK you have to do that before getting new miracles, but if you read something
otherwise in Fire and Brimstone go ahead.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Looks to be just a regular oil lantern.
Fifteen minutes to midnight.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: Is it moving?
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Sitting still.
Who would leave a lantern out on the ground.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Who else is up at this hour'a night?"

Nephi "Longiron" Delano: Well, pants with suspenders, but same thing basically.
"...darn, wish I had a light..."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Your eyes get used to the night after a few minutes.
You can't see anything beyond the light though, and if you do try, you'll lose your night eyes.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano carries it in his off hand, keeping his rifle over his shoulder with the other,
realizing that he should probably pick up a lantern sometime.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano walks towards the lantern
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: Which I actually cannot see.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Little to the right and further up.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: ""...Ain't this town ever heard of streetlights..."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: You did see some streetlights on your way in.
Funny that they aren't lit now.
Must be running low on oil or something.
Couple more feet to the right, the lantern is right there.
There's something next to it.
Glinting in the light.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Must be metal.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks at what's out here.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Looks like the hilt of a knife stuck into the ground.
Looks like a good knife too.
Right next to the lantern.
What do you do Mormon boy?

Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Why'd someone go stabbin the ground?"
Also, can't hear any music, if there's supposed to be some, can you turn it up?

touch. nice work.

(From Poage): Got it. Because right now... Crystal told Whitney quite a bit. Most of what she can remember.
Rockett Rimjob: "..."
"Ah'm gonna ask you in tha mornin' when yer more coherent than a drunken infant."
(To Poage): Got it.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano stays like that for several long minutes, before he eventually starts to return to
his normal self, though still more than a little shaken.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Rockett? You..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano only seems to register her presence now.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...You... You shouldn't have..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano sighs.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "But you did, and... I guess..."
Rockett Rimjob: "Yer one ta fuckin' talk."
"Mister Ah'm gonna walk out there at night like a jackass."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Aww. You do care~"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano manages a tiny smile before it fades back into the lingering look of terror, as his
eyes constantly dart to all the lights in the room, and the entrances.
Rockett Rimjob: "Who was that?"
"Details."
"Details."
"No cryptic nonsense."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Don't know. He never was polite enough to give me his name."
"...I called him the Pale Rider. Because he rode a black horse."
"And because... Y'know. Tall giant, white as milk."
Rockett Rimjob: "Why's he care about you?
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...He's been followin me since I was 10."
Rockett Rimjob: "Why?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Don't know. Maybe it was something mama did."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano passes out.
Rockett Rimjob closes the door behind her.
Rockett Rimjob heads back down to the bar for a few more drinks.
Bartender nods his head to Rockett as she comes back down. The bar is empty, save for her.
Rockett Rimjob: "...Whadaya got that passes fer whiskey here?"
Bartender: "Whiskey."
"Occasionally, whiskey."
"Sometimes with whiskey flavoring."
"Want some?"
Rockett Rimjob: "Please."
(From Yuppie b.): would this be a good time to introduce Natasha lol
(To Yuppie b.): Maybe wait till we're in the middle of a proper session.
(To Yuppie b.): So she can roll up in her phat moneymobile.
Bartender sets a bottle down next to Rockett's hand. It has no label on it, but the liquid is amber.
Bartender sets a glass with three hunks of ice in it next to that.

Bartender pours her a measure.

Rockett Rimjob: "Mighta gotten involved inta somethin' Ah really shouldn't've."
"But nah. Ah jus' need a drink."
"Business better t'day?"
Bartender: "Mmmm."
"Business good as always."
"Thanks for using the glass."
Bartender rests his back against the other side of the bar. He crosses one arm over his midsection as the
other sets to tugging at his mustache.
Rockett Rimjob: "Reckon folks'll start pourin' in tomorrow since Ah'm in town. Ah'll be around fer most of tha day,
Ah reckon -- got some detective work ta do, an' Ah could use some cash besides."
Bartender: "Good."
"Thanks for the business."
"Detective work?"
Rockett Rimjob: "Deeeetective work."
Rockett Rimjob sips from her glass.
Bartender nods the nod of a sage.
Rockett Rimjob: "Buddy got murdered couple months back. Few more even longer ago."
"Tryin'a find who dunnit."

Nevermore: And so am I, imma nap/lie down for a bit.
Rockett Rimjob: "Bar's pretty empty."
Nevermore: Onoooo
Bartender: "..."
Bartender walks through the doors to the kitchen. Sounds of sizzling meat and the nose tingling aroma of
spice drift through to Rockett in a minute or two.
Rockett Rimjob can't help but smile.
Bartender walks back into the room with a plate in his left hand and a few new stains drying on his apron.
He sets the plate down next to Rockett's glass of whiskey.
Bartender crouches down and scrabbles under the bar. He emerges with a bottle of ketchup, spicy
mustard, and a cellar each of salt and pepper.
Rockett Rimjob: She takes a gander at the food in front of her, sliding all of the condiments away for the moment.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Looks to be two fresh fried chicken breasts between two fresh fried buns. Little grease
still on them. There is a sweet herby smell about it.
Rockett Rimjob seems to be pleased with this and the smell. "Not bad. S'pose a deal's a deal."
Rockett Rimjob reaches up and undoes the first few buttons of her corset, and lets her dress slip down off
of her arms. Everything above her belly button is plain for the world to see.
Rockett Rimjob grabs the salt, and trickles a little bit on the cooked breasts.
Wonderful Cowboy Land puts one hand on the bar to steady himself.

Bartender also puts one hand on the bar to steady himself.
Bartender: "Rumors are true."
Rockett Rimjob chuckles a bit, grabbing her fork and prodding at her dish.
Rockett Rimjob: "Like what ya see?"
Bartender: "Mmmm."
"Got a pair of aces."
Rockett Rimjob takes a bite of chicken, chewing slowly and acting a little... -too- pleased by the taste.
Rockett Rimjob: "Mmm..."
Bartender leans back and takes in the sight. His mustache twitches up a little in what might be a grin.
Rockett Rimjob: "Not bad... Been a while since Ah've had a decent meal like this."
Bartender: "Getting a little hungry maself."
Rockett Rimjob: "That so?"
Bartender: "Such an appetizing display."
"Only natural."
Rockett Rimjob: "Well. Glad it's nice. But that's all it is, hun."
"An appetizer," she says, taking another big bite of her chicken. She shakes her body a bit, giving her mounds a
little jiggle.
Bartender: "And the main course?"
Rockett Rimjob: "Depends what you want on yer entree."
Bartender: "Split peach?"
Rockett Rimjob: "Hm... Depends on what ya wanna do fer dessert."
Bartender: "Thinking something with cream filling."
Rockett Rimjob: "Hmm... that ain't real cheap. Not at all."
"You sure you can afford that?"
Bartender: "I'm a man of wealth and taste."
Rockett Rimjob: "Man'a taste, huh? Take it you don't want none of that rowdy ramblin' business, then. You seem
like you want a passion treat."
Rockett Rimjob takes another bite.
Bartender: "Don't know, might be a man of rough taste."
Rockett Rimjob raises her brows. "Well. Price depends on a few things, sweetie. Normally folks jus' want
me ta get a little grabby, maybe taste their cookin'. This, though... don't come 'round as often."

"You gimme tha full fifty, an' Ah'll stick around a while longer. Show you tha best, give you some pointers. Bump it

Bartender reaches into his apron pocket and takes out a wad of bills. He counts a few out without looking
at them, then slides them across the table.
Rockett Rimjob grabs the bills and gives it a looksie.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Five tens.
Rockett Rimjob slides the tens right into her dress, below her right pillow.
Rockett Rimjob: "Sure thing. Meetin' in mah room? Or d'you wanna take this back ta yer bed?"
Rockett Rimjob takes another bite of her chicken.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: "Your room's fine."
Bartender: *
"I'll lock up here after you're done."
Rockett Rimjob starts eating a little faster, and nods once.
Rockett Rimjob: "Sure thing."
Rockett Rimjob hurries up, eats the last few bites, and slides the plate to the bartender.
Bartender takes the plate and disappears with it to the kitchen. He returns and replaces the condiments
under the bar.
Bartender: "Finish your drink?"
Rockett Rimjob: "Yes sir."
"You ready ta tango?"
Rockett Rimjob stands up off of her stool.

warm, ample globe.
Bartender: "Lead the way, wayward woman."
Rockett Rimjob: "--HellOOo, mister Randy...!"
Rockett Rimjob smiles wide, and makes her way back up to her room.

Alexander Hauswald: "...He thinks he's patronizing."
Rockett Rimjob: "Huh."
"Well, glad Ah made a friend," she says, leaning back in her seat and trying to relax.
Alexander Hauswald: "So's he."
Alexander Hauswald sits down on a nearby seat, just silently looking at Rockett and the dog.

Rockett Rimjob: "Ah don't mind gettin' right into tha action. Up close an' personal."

"Might get a pair some time down tha road, but Ah can work jus' fine without 'em."
Alexander Hauswald: "Fair enough.
Don't see why glasses would make you less pretty."
Alexander Hauswald is as stoic as ever when he says that.

Scotty: k
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Rockett and Nephi are wandering around the town as night turns into dark. They have
not yet gone back to the saloon to rest and had their strange encounter with the pale man. They are conducting
their investigations into Dodge. It consists largely of walking around waiting for something obvious to fall into their
laps since Nephi is about as sharp as wet dirt and Rockett's eyes don't work too good. However, they are just
lucky enough that something interesting happens by.
A...what do you call it? Steam wagon? It seems inaccurate for this vehicle. This thing is not a wagon, it is a piece
of art with wheels. It rolls into town with its equally opulent appearing occupant. Greenbacks actually float out of
the back of the thing as it skids to a halt right outside town hall, scaring every horse within a mile.
(To Yuppie b.): That's your cue.
(To Yuppie b.): You're here on behalf of the rail company to meet with a few other reps to discuss a pressing
issue on the brothel side of things. Profits have been down low, and you think you know why...
Scotty looks up at the wagon with a smile as it approaches to a halt.
Rockett Rimjob: *
Natasha Minayeva : The door to this strange metal wagon is opened and from it's depths stepped a woman of
almost ethereal beauty. With a loud clack her foot found the ground below. Dressed in a large white overcoat and
wielding an opulent cane in her gloved hands, the silver haired woman flashed the world a wicked, almost
predatory grin. Her eyes alight with a sharp, dangerous spark that bled into her confident stride.
Nevermore: i heard i was missing memes
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Welcome.
To memes.
Rockett Rimjob places her hands on her hips and stands adease, in her typical skimpy garments.
Nevermore: Oh my yes. I will bring only the rarest of pepes
Natasha Minayeva : Clack clack clack

Natasha Minayeva places her hand on the hilt of her cane and turns her head to the whore
Natasha Minayeva : "Who the fuck are you and why do you look so familiar?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Rockett, what am i lookin at right now?"
Rockett Rimjob: "Ah got no ahdea," she says to the mystery woman. "You look at a lotta sinful photo albums?"
Rockett Rimjob glances at Nephi and shrugs.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Because it looks like a steam wagon. With acrual money coming out of it."
Natasha Minayeva narrows her eyes and flashes her teeth. "Da. I know exactly who you are. I saw you on
the way..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Yer muffler needs replacement."
Natasha Minayeva : "Как чудесно! I was actually here because of you."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "They really aint supposed to be THAT loud."
"...who, me?"
(To Yuppie b.): It isn't actually Rockett that's the problem.
Rockett Rimjob: "Rockett hunter, are ya?" she asks with a sly smirk.
(To Yuppie b.): It's with one of the other reps.
Natasha Minayeva : "Does it look like I am talking to you?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "A-"
Natasha Minayeva : "Da! I was looking for a little relief"
(To Yuppie b.): Something about a Club 99 being run by someone called Rickert.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano raises finger
Nephi "Longiron" Delano lowrrs it.
Natasha Minayeva : "What do you want?"
"Can't you see I am talking to lady?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Have fun, shes a real peach."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano gets out of the way of the angry lady
Natasha Minayeva : "If I gave peach right now would you shove in stupid face so I can have peaceful
conversation?"
"There we go..."
"Anyways, yes. I was looking for professional."

Natasha Minayeva extends her hand

Rockett Rimjob reaches out and gives it a firm shake.
Rockett Rimjob: "Don't tell me Ah'm tha only reason you came all tha way out to tha middle'a nowhere..."
Natasha Minayeva matches her in firmness...not something you could say often
Natasha Minayeva : "No no no...though it does have something to do with Brothel. I have...what you call diverse

"Someone has been cutting into business. Someone called..."Rickert" at a club 99."
"Sound familar?"
Rockett Rimjob: "Hm?"
Natasha Minayeva : "Do you know a Rickert?"
"They sound like cheap rip off."
"I don't much care for cheap. Or being ripped off."
(To Scotty): You've heard whisperings of this. Rickert is the fellow that works the assets for Dixie Rails' whores.
Rockett Rimjob: "...Actually, you got a point. Ah've heard that name."
"Chinese bootleg Rockett, apparently."
Natasha Minayeva : "I am here to discuss problem with boring people. Then I will decide how I will deal with

"'Scuse me?"

Rockett Rimjob smiles wickedly.
(To Yuppie b.): Natasha, you were already fashionably late to the meeting when you arrived. The others should
be waiting in town hall.
Natasha Minayeva : "Why not?"
"You are not bad looking man."
Rockett Rimjob: "He's a mormon boy."

Natasha Minayeva : "I am late. Can not keep stuffy men waiting forever...if you will be my guest tonight you may

"If you want to come mormon boy...option is there~"
"I hope you screw better than Russian Orthodox."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano sighs
Natasha Minayeva chuckles like mad
Natasha Minayeva : "Anyways...have places to be. Pleasure to meet you all. Will see you..." She says, pointing
her finger at Rockett with a grin. "Later."
Natasha Minayeva places the glove back on her hand
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Dangit, Rockett, one'a yew was bad enough."
Rockett Rimjob: "Of course. Ah'll see you t'night, honey doll~" she coos, nodding at Natasha and tipping her
bonnet.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano says, as Natasha heads off.
Natasha Minayeva : "Dasvidaniya~" She says with one final grin before striding off towards the town hall.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Natasha disappears through the doors of town hall. It doesn't look like it should be that
hard to follow her, if you're careful about it. This does seem like good detective work.
Rockett Rimjob doesn't really want to intervene. She can get all the info she wants later tonight, and
doesn't want to risk losing a client that has a goddamn steam wagon.
(To Yuppie b.): Natasha passes through the doors of the town hall and continues through a short antechamber
into the circular meeting room. There are two others there. One looks to be the rep from the Baron's branch of the
railroad and the other appears to be from Black River's side of town.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: There's a clattering of hooves off in the distance from roughly the same direction
Natasha just came.
Rockett Rimjob looks.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: It is a jet black wagon with silver embellishments drawn by two pure white horses. It
seems a little bit less sophisticated than Natasha's ride, more old school. Just as fancy though.
The carriage comes up to town hall and stops.
There is a long pause as the horses spit, neigh, and steam into the open air.
Rockett Rimjob watches.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The door of the carriage slams open and a thin figure dressed in a tasteful black suit,
white shirt, and well oiled black half boots gets out. His hair is supremely styled and his flair is obvious.
Rockett Rimjob: "Someone's dressed up in their fancy-pants!" she calls out at him as soon as he steps out.

(From Natasha Minayeva ): "Sorry I am late. Tonight we are here to discuss mutual issues." She says, opting to
stand rather then sit. "This everyone? There should be more."
Rickert looks down to Rockett as he descends from his perch.
Rickert: "Miss Rockett, pleased to make your acquaintance darlin'."
Rockett Rimjob: "Howdy howdy!"
Rickert: "Yer reputation precedes you."
Rickert steps down and takes Rockett's hand. He plants a kiss thereupon.
Rockett Rimjob: "Aww..."
"Why thank you."
"Who do Ah owe tha pleasure?"
Rickert: "Aw, you probly don' know me."
"Call me Rickert."
"I'm the one that runs all the show business for Dixie Rails."
Rockett Rimjob: "Dixie Rails, huh?"

Rickert: "I'm here to strut my stuff."
"Be the center of attention."
"Lot like you."
Rockett Rimjob: "You got some competition t'night, friendo."

"You gonna show me up, or summun else?"
Rockett Rimjob: "Honey, who else in tha Americas could stand up ta this?" she asks, swinging her hips a little.
(To Yuppie b.): "We waiting on Dixie Rails bigead." Says the one that appears to be the Baron's girl, judging by
the facial markings, ratty top hat, and staff.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Aw heck another one?" Nephi mumbles under his breath

Rockett Rimjob turns back to Rickert. "That so? Well, Ah'm a little booked t'night -- might go fer tha

Rockett Rimjob: "C'mere, Nephi, fer jus' a second."
Rickert: "Well, I may not have the most momey, but I'm a good bou."
"Mississippi grown."

Rickert: "Shit, see you after the meetin' hun'."
"You stay pretty now."
Rockett Rimjob: "Can do~"
(From Natasha Minayeva ): "String him up naked as I take him for a ride on my airship. He will talk."
Rickert: "What I like to hear."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: heads over
(To Yuppie b.): Walks into the town hall like he owns the damn place and the business next door too. He twirls the
toothpick between his teeth and he makes his way to the round table and takes a seat. He sprawls into a chair
and kicks one leg up onto the desk. "So, whadda you ladies want of lil' ol' me?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "What?"
Rockett Rimjob whispers to nephi
Nephi "Longiron" Delano seems mighty confused... and then flushes completely red and damn near falls
over
Rockett Rimjob: "See you two handsome hunks later~"
(From Natasha Minayeva ): "Ah! Yes! Man of the hour! Finally come to grace us with presence..." She says as
she approaches him with a wide smile. "Johnny rebel." As she approaches she clenches her fists and swings for

Nephi "Longiron" Delano runs off in the direction Natasha's carriage went off in.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Natasha went into the town hall.
(To Yuppie b.): The punch sails towards him and smacks him square in the jaw. He goes to the floor. He gets up
in a second and returns to his position. The only difference is he's holding a handkerchief to his nose now. The
handkerchief turns a gradual red.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Do you go into the town hall?
(From Natasha Minayeva ): "There...with that out of way. We can have healthy conversation." She says as she
moves back to her seat. "So Rickert...what the fuck?"

Nevermore: I'm back with dinner
Yep.
Nephi heads to town hall.

is simple. It is nothing personal...just want to know how it Is you are hogging business so much."
(To Yuppie b.): "You've been taking girls. Girls that the rest of us could use."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Nephi, you see a short anteroom, and a door. There are voices coming from the other
side of the door.

"To the surprise'a nobody. How up on current events are ya, miss Rockett?"
Rockett Rimjob: "A dilemma."
"Let's jus' go to tha bar an' relax a bit 'fore tha night's through."
Natasha Minayeva : "I would love to see you dip your dick in my thorny bush. If I had one still."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Right. Well, you do the relaxin, I'll do the thinkin. Sound good?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano taps his noggin with his pencil.
Rockett Rimjob: "...You tellin' me Ah can't do no thinkin'?"
Natasha Minayeva : "But I don't fuck rapists like that."
Rockett Rimjob: "Whadaya think Ah am? A dumb mindless slut?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "No, I'm just sayin yew much prefer the relaxin."
Rickert: "Well, how do you fuck rapists?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano chuckles.
Rockett Rimjob: "Bastard."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Whore."

Rickert stands up and walks over to Natasha.
Natasha Minayeva : "Why don't you drop by the White dragon and I show you?"
Rickert: "Ah ain't into peggin'."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "But you want to help me puzzle out just what's goin on here, I'm open to help."
Rickert: "You do have my cordial invitation to Club 99."
"Should your starch white shirt and alabaster ass decide to undo your wadded panties."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "I know Dixie Rails is owned by the rebs, just like the Union Pacific is owned by the
Union."
"Can't say I'm surprised that Natasha and Rickert want to stab each other with long knives."
Natasha Minayeva : "Understood. Speaking of unwadding panties...I am going to fuck off now."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...We'd be dumb'r than bricks to not take the opportunity to get into at least some of

"Two of the ones there, though, I couldn't identify."
"Maybe someone from Iron Dragon or one of the other railroads."
Lizzie: "I would like to tell Rickert to take his mile long prick and make a couple lengths of sausage, but I'm sure
he gets the point."
Rickert: "Love you too honey."
Natasha Minayeva : "Yes. Lets call it a night then. It was nice seeing you girls...and girl man."
Rockett Rimjob: "Ah getcha."
Rickert: "Don't be jealous cause my hair's better'n yours."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Phew..."
Natasha Minayeva : "That is a lie and you know it."
Rickert walks out of town hall with the handkerchief held to his face.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "You just make sure you know what yer doin when you get involved between these

Rickert: "Sure, and my name's Genghis Fuckin' Khan."

Rickert strolls out of town hall and into his carriage.
Natasha Minayeva : "...he is handsome." She says as she wipes some of the blood away from her glove while he
walks away. "Shame he makes his business in rape."
Rockett Rimjob: "There's a reason railroad runners from both sides of tha Mason-Dixon line pine fer me
personally."
Natasha Minayeva takes some time to clean the blood away
Rockett Rimjob: "Ah'm real good at straddlin' tha fence."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Ah ain't gonna pry."
Rockett Rimjob: "Ah'm real good at straddlin' a lotta things."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Was that another innuendo?"
"...Lord give me strength."
Natasha Minayeva eventually gets up and strolls off once everyone else is gone
Rockett Rimjob: "You've been prayin' a lot more'n normal lately, Nephi."
"You sure you's keepin' them innocent eyes from wanderin'?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Well, maybe Whitney's been a good influence on me."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano smirks.
Rockett Rimjob: "..."
Rockett Rimjob grits her teeth a bit.
Rockett Rimjob: "Neat."
Bartender polishes a mug as he walks over to Nephi and Rockett
Rockett Rimjob seems a little pissed.
Rockett Rimjob turns to the bartender.
Rockett Rimjob: "Hey hun."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano leans back in his seat, and would be chewing bubblegum if any was available.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Yew got any sasparilla?"
Bartender: "Drink?"
Bartender nods to Nephi.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Gimme a tall glass."
Rockett Rimjob: "Sasparilla sounds pretty good right now, actually. Make it two."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "But make hers dirty. I think she'd appreciate it."

Rockett Rimjob: "Not now. Ah ain't yearnin' for any booze just yet."
"Maybe t'night."
Bartender picks two bottles out from an ice box under the counter and sets them on the bartop.
Bartender lays his hand on each and takes the cap off without a bottle opener. They don't look like twist
offs.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Ahh, ain't this the life? What a time to be alive. Ice cold drinks in bars across the
country."
"This keeps up, you'll be able to have some in your very own home.:"
Bartender: "Mmmm."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is too busy being able to have fun at Rockett's expense to notice.
(From Natasha Minayeva ): She would send someone to fetch rockett a bit later
(To Yuppie b.): Gotcha.
(From Natasha Minayeva ): Cordially
Rockett Rimjob shrugs, grabs her bottle, nods at the bartender, and takes a sip.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano does much the same.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Bet that Natasha character has an icebox in her steam wagon."
"What'd you thinka them anyways, Rockett?"
Rockett Rimjob: "...look like a good lay."
Rockett Rimjob sips
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "You think about anythin' else?"
Bartender rests his back against the other side of the bar and lets the two converse.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Like, ever?"
Rockett Rimjob: "No. Ah'm a mindless whore focused on nothin' but sex."
Rockett Rimjob says flatly.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Ha-hah."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano takes another sip.
Rockett Rimjob seems a little bitter.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Real good stuff, thanks Bartender."
Rockett Rimjob is just a liiiiittle bitter.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "What's gone and crawled into you?"

Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Glad I'm not the John that's gonna have to smell it tonight, then."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano sips more.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks down into the bottle.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Rockett, ah..."
Rockett Rimjob sips.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Ah'm sorry I'm givin ya such a hard time."
"...S'just how I cope."
Rockett Rimjob: "Ain't tha first, won't be tha last. Might as well enjoy yerself while ya do it."
Rockett Rimjob sips.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "I am, but..."
"Yew ain't. And I'm sure ya get enough guano dumped on ya' from every pastor from here to perdition itself."
"I know yew got your reasons fer doin what you do."
"Just like Helaman got his. Life'a sin's real easy. Yew don't gotta think if you don't want to."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano sips
Rockett Rimjob: "Ah get it. Ya think Ah'm stupid."
Rockett Rimjob sets her empty bottle on the table.
Rockett Rimjob digs a cigar out of her bag, and grabs a match.
Rockett Rimjob stands up, and as she angrily tries to light it, she starts making her way to the rooms in
the back.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Naw."
"...I think yew made bad choices. Just like we all have."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano finishes his bottle too.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "But we all got the chance to change."
"It ain't too late for yew, Rockett."
"...You don't gotta live like this. Always another way."
"Food for thought, yeah?"
Rockett Rimjob: "Burn in hell."
Rockett Rimjob says simply, right before closing a door very rudely behind her.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "..."
"...Ah, women."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano hops off his chair and pulls out a dollar and places it on the counter.

"Keep the change."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano sighs.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Guess some folk don't wanna change."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano puts his hands in his pockets and slowly walks away from the bar, back towards
his room, unable to sleep.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano then starts doing what he always does when stressed and unable to sleep,
cleaning his guns.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano keeps doing this until very late at night, when he looks out the door, and sees a
single lit lantern...
Nephi "Longiron" Delano could probably stand being interrupted before then, though.
Whitney G. Elieen: And you might be surprised to see, of all people, the giant and unmistakable figure of Whitney
walking her way in. You could almost hear her footsteps...
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Whitney?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads to the door and opens it.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Yer up late."
Whitney G. Elieen: "..."
Whitney G. Elieen walks forward and nods silently...
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Hey, you alright?"
"...C'mere, I got some stuff to tell ya."
Whitney G. Elieen: "And I have things to tell you, son of Joseph."
"Where is my sister?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Probably seein to the pleasure of one of the town gentlemen, if I had to guess."
"Had a real interestin day out with her today, by the way."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is still mostly dressed, though has ditched his duster for just his shirt and
suspendered pants.
Whitney G. Elieen turns her head around and looks at you. Her eyes red with exaustion. Perhaps
something else as well. "She is not hurt is she?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Naw."
"...C'mon in. Sit down, you look like yew need it."
"Will some scripture cheer ya'up? I'll read, if ya'd like."
Whitney G. Elieen: "..." She nods her head and sits herself down. "I do not know the manner of beast we
fight...but I think I know how we may fight it."
"I will...explain later. I would love to hear you read the scripture. Soon."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Well, s'like my mama always said. We can do all things through Christ, who
strengthens us."

"Usually said when she got bit by somethin out in the fields, but still counts."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano gets Whitney one of the blankets from his bed and wraps it around her
shoulders.
Whitney G. Elieen smiles a little at that.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Always listened to my mama... After all, "I, Nephi, being born of goodly parents..."..."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Wise words...reminds me of my mother a little. She used to say such things on our worst of
days."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "First scripture and verse in the Book o'Mormon and my name's in it."
"Here, lemme dig up my bible, it's around here somewhere..."
"Where did i leave it..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano starts checking around the room.
Whitney G. Elieen reaches into her own pack
Whitney G. Elieen produces her own
Whitney G. Elieen: "It is not the book of Mormon but...it will do."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "You shoulda seen yer sister today. She did a good job."
"Helped get some real good information that'll help us out."
Whitney G. Elieen: "She was always very talented."
Whitney G. Elieen says softly
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has just produced a holy-hell-that's-so-huge book of scripture why is it so big
Nephi "Longiron" Delano sets it on the table nearest Whitney.
Whitney G. Elieen: "Son of Joseph. May I confess something to you?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "The combination book. Book of mormon, bible, Pearl of Great Price, and the
doctrines of the-"
"Yeah?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "...I may have had a little more to drink than I should have. Before coming here."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Yew shouldn't dew that. Yer body's a temple, after all. You wouldn't mess up a temple
to god, would ya?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano sits nearby with the big book in his lap.
Whitney G. Elieen nods her head slowly
Whitney G. Elieen: "Yes I understand..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "But go on. What's got ya drinkin more than my brother in his dens o'sin?"

Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...It's yer sister, isn't it?"
"You're worried about her."
"...She's been outta yer life fer so long, and now she's close again."
"Yew wanna protect her, do the right thing for her, but'cha don't know how."
Whitney G. Elieen: "..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Bring her back into the light."
Whitney G. Elieen: "I don't...I don't want her to hate me..."
Whitney G. Elieen begins to sniffle
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...There's a parable, in the Book of Mormon about this."
"The story of the Prodigal Son."
"Would ya like to hear it?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "..."
Whitney G. Elieen nods
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Ah don;t got it all memorized, so ah'm paraphrasin a bit here."
"Once, a wealthy man had two sons. He was getting on in years. His oldest son had been faithful to his father all
his years, but his youngest was wild, with the strength of youth."
"The youngest son, desiring greatly the things of the world, demanded his inheritance from his father."
"His father agreed after much asking, and his son disappeared off into the world, refusing his father's council."
"The son lived among the men of the world, enjoying all the damning pleasures of sin and money. He had many
friends, and was renowned for his habits and charming personality."
"Until his inheritance started to run dry."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Soon, he found all his friends leavin' him. They had only stayed to enjoy his wealth
and the sinful delights he could bring them."
"He could find no work, had no skills to survive."
"Soon, he found himself living with the pigs in a sty on a ranch, envying their slop.
"Alone. Worthless. Hated."
"...With the last of his strength, he decided he would return to his father's house and cast himself as a slave, for it
would be better than envying pigs for their slop."
"While he was heading home and still a far off, his father had been watching, and waiting."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "The moment he saw a figure approaching his residence, he had hope without hope,
and he ran to the approaching figure. For you see, the entire time, the father had been watching for his foolish son
who he had thought dead."

"As soon as he recognized his son, he threw himself on him, and embraced him.
"He stank of pig slop, and was caked in mud and rags."
"And he cast himself at his father's feet, and begged to be allowed to become a slave."
"But his father said nay, for this day the Lord had caused his son to come back from the grave."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has started tearing up, just the slightest bit.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano sniffles.
Whitney G. Elieen: "..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "His father said "Come, son, we will slay the fatted calf, and clothe you in fine raiment,
and I will bless you to reenter my house."
"But the Prodigal Son's brother looked on, outraged."
" "He wastes his inheritance and comes home when it's gone, to a feast?" "
"His father chastised him for this. He said. "You have been good and faithful to me for all these years and do not
think I have forgotten. But this day your brother has returned from the dead."
"Long have I waited, and now my family is whole once more."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks down, then back up at Whitney.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Ah mighta missed some parts, but that's the gist of it."
"You try to push her, to pull her back, she'll push back just as hard."
"She'll fight yew because she can. Because it's easy. Because she'll think it's right."
"The wages of sin are sadness."
"Sure, it's all fun and games now. Ridin around, gettin treated all fancy by randy men..."
"It's gonna end one day. She's gonna get old, or fat, or crank out more kids'n my mama."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "And if yer there for her, she'll come back t'yew."
"And you'll rejoice."
Whitney G. Elieen: "...she is like this because of me. Because I pushed her away...she came to me for help and
guidance and instead I..."
"I was...I was just trying to help..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "I know how ya feel."
Whitney G. Elieen tears up anew, wiping fresh tears away from her eyes.
Whitney G. Elieen: "I didn't want to...I didn't..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads over, and places a single hand on Whitney's shoulder.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "The road t'hell's paved with good intentions, Whitney..."
"But so's the road t'heaven."
"Yer a good girl. Yer tryin to do the right thing."
"That's step one, y'know?"
"Trust in'th lord. He'll help you find the rest o'the way."

Crystal Saint Claire: TT-TT
Yupo has been busy
I can vouch for it
It was presented, and donned, in character
Cedric: If she don't have it on the sheet I can't know about it.
Whitney G. Elieen: Doc is right. I should have remembered to add it.
Though this does remind me...
Crystal Saint Claire: TT-TT
Whitney G. Elieen: is it a light vest or heavy vest?
Crystal Saint Claire: I wanna say it was the one that let you move.
Light.
Because if you wore heavy your movement would be "nope"
Whitney G. Elieen: Good choice
Cedric pulls back from Crystal with red around his jaws. He wipes it away with one ragged arm. Crystal's
wounds heal quickly with the power of the Lord and she suffers no wound.
Whitney G. Elieen: Witty is already T H I C C enough as it is
Cedric: It is now
Alex man time.
Crystal Saint Claire: (Wait, what just happened)

Alexander Hauswald: ((holy shit I didn't even have to call it))
Cedric: Cedric bit Crystal, but due to the powers of JESUS
Alexander Hauswald: ((Battle hymn, poggo))
Cedric: She doesn't take a wound.
Crystal Saint Claire: (More importantly, did she just FEEL that thing tear her throat out?)
Cedric: Yes.
Though less tear.
More of bite.
Still four neat holes in her throat though.

Whitney G. Elieen gasps in pain as the ghoul unloads into her! The mysterious power she wields healing
up one of the wounds in her chest, though it left her bloodied enough as is...
Cedric: Alex's shot passes slams into the pale thing's head. The creature stumbles, blood rushing from
somewhere around his left cheek. His jaw sags with a disgusting looseness now.
(From Crystal Saint Claire): I just realized I have made a fuckin' MASSIVE error build wise
(To Poage): Wossat?
(From Crystal Saint Claire): I put points in Shotgun because nev told me I NEEDED points in it to use the

Alexander Hauswald: I think that's accurate enough to operate for brain cancer.
With a chainsaw.
Cedric: The final shot sails through the air and enters the thing's forehead with uncommon grace. It digs through
bone, brain, and more bone, before coming out the other end. The bullet looks like a beauteous, freshly sprouted
flower of red.
Cedric lurches forward for a few moments, and falls to the dusty ground in front of Alex. With no living
flesh to actuate it, this nightmare mad material is nothing more than a pile of odorous offal.
Alexander Hauswald: "..."
"Rest in peace."
Crystal Saint Claire is still freaking out.
Undead Leadslinger jerks, and falls to the ground in a lifeless heap. The rest of the zombies still standing
do the same.
Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit: "Did we get 'em?"
Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit walks forward and pokes a re-dead dead body with his gun.
Alexander Hauswald: "I think we did."
Whitney G. Elieen releases her song and falls to the ground
Whitney G. Elieen gasps!
Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit: But first.
Crystal Saint Claire has, by now, at least stopped screaming, and downgraded to curling up in a ball on

Whitney G. Elieen slowly gets herself back up onto her feet. "...Thank you Lord, for blessing me with
capable friends."

Alexander Hauswald holsters his gun. And examines Cedric's.
Whitney G. Elieen steps across the bloodied mess of bone and muscle
Whitney G. Elieen leans herself down and grabs Crystal
Whitney G. Elieen pulls her into a hug...
Hamilton Hendricks looks up from the tombstone with eyes puffy and red from crying.
Crystal Saint Claire starts screaming and kicking the moment Whitney touches her.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The gun is a rusty colt Navy Alex.
Whitney G. Elieen: "Shhhh-"
Crystal Saint Claire: "No! Let meGO! nooOOOOOOO!"
Whitney G. Elieen: "It's okay..."

Hamilton Hendricks: (be back in a tick)
Alexander Hauswald: "It's over."
Whitney G. Elieen: "It is done..."
Alexander Hauswald turns to Hamilton, breathing deeply.
Alexander Hauswald: "What did you do?"
Crystal Saint Claire seems to realize it's Whitney holding her, and just... crumples like wet paper into a
silently sobbing heap.
Hamilton Hendricks rolls onto his side and produces a noise halfway between sobbing and laughter.
Whitney G. Elieen: "There there..."
"Nothing more will hurt you...
Hamilton Hendricks: (back)
Crystal Saint Claire clings to Whitney, ignoring everything else until her heartbeat slows back down.
Hamilton Hendricks: "He's...dead."
Alexander Hauswald: "Sure is."
"Why'd he get up?"
Hamilton Hendricks pushes himself to a sitting position with his arms and leans his back against the
tombstone.

Alexander Hauswald: "Call him, then."
"Did he tell you how to do that?"
Alexander Hauswald motions to the goblin
Hamilton Hendricks: "Yeah..."
Hamilton Hendricks pulls a pen knife from his pants pocket. He flicks it out. He puts one hand around the
blade and draws the pen knife out. Red flows from the cut. He smears it on the ground in the shape of an
unbounded star.
Sacks whimpers.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Wh-whitney? P-please... would you mind getting my gun? I dropped it..."
Whitney G. Elieen: "...of course."
Hamilton Hendricks slumps back onto the tombstone. His jaw is slack.
Whitney G. Elieen says as she moves to fetch said weapon
Sacks grips his gun in his holster

Whitney G. Elieen places Crystal behind her.

Whitney G. Elieen: "I know as well"
Alexander Hauswald pulls out one of the unidentified coins.
Alexander Hauswald: "Will this be enough?"

Crystal Saint Claire stares at ???'s feet.

"Fun to collect, but worthless, in the end."

Alexander Hauswald: "I can pay in favours."
"You help us, I'll help you one day."
Whitney G. Elieen: "I know the name of the creature and so does God. You will be paying this demon for a boon

Alexander Hauswald: "Why'd we come here?"

Crystal Saint Claire: "...forever?"

Whitney G. Elieen: "I thought we could learn more of this demon. The ability to kill is with me already. But further

Crystal Saint Claire continues writing.
Crystal Saint Claire: "But this pertains to his contract, sir."
???: "Does it?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "Crystal..."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Yes, sir. I would like to add a clause stating that Mr. Hauswald's present alliances, at the
time of the favor's calling, would take precedence over any obligations brought upon him by the favor."
???: "No."
Crystal Saint Claire: "To put it simply, it's just a clause that would prevent you from having him shoot us in the
back."
"We can change some of the wording, if you'd like..."
???: "The favor will be carte blanche."
Alexander Hauswald: "That too. When I take the bargain, I don't want to end up suffering for it."
???: "If you want what you're asking for."
Crystal Saint Claire: "That is... a rather steep price for three questions, is it not?"
Alexander Hauswald: "I don't want to end up with something like, say, going on a shootout and finding out I shot
Whitney."
???: "If you want something without suffering for it, I'm afraid you're talking to the wrong person."
Crystal Saint Claire sighs.
Alexander Hauswald: "I want a fair price."

"Which is as fair as it comes."

(From Crystal Saint Claire): For later, the three quesries are a request for information regarding the revenant
(origin, any particular strengths or weaknesses, and its preferred strategies), how to PUT it down, and how to
KEEP it down afterwards.
Alexander Hauswald: "If others don't as a result, I don't mind."
Whitney G. Elieen: "...Are you certain of this?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "I have... a draft here. Factoring in Mr. Hauswald's stipulation, this demon's desires, and a
precise quantification of the trade. There are still SOME ways this could be abused, but I've tried to take away
some of the more egregious offenses."
"For example, if the favor was signing into some larger, more elaborate deal designed to further ensnare you, that
would go against this draft."
"The favor would be non-transferrable."
Alexander Hauswald: "He can't make me sign a deal like that."
"It's not how it works."
Crystal Saint Claire: "..."
"...i do not understand most of this, but I understand contractual law..."
Whitney G. Elieen: "...It follows a more...infernal set of rules Crystal."
"It is more akin to a shady casino then a true court of law."
Alexander Hauswald: "He can't back out on his deals. But he can and will twist the words as much as he can."
Crystal Saint Claire: "...then agreeing to a carte blanch means he can ask you to do literally anything of which
you are capable."
Alexander Hauswald: "Correct."
Crystal Saint Claire: "And you are completely capable of entering a contract, as we have just seen, no?"
"It could be considered as forcing you into a contract, but this is not a court of law."
Alexander Hauswald: "You got a point."
"Name your favor, demon."
Crystal Saint Claire: "...He has said he wishes it to remain somewhat nebulous... I believe there should just be a
few stipulations preventing obvious infractions."
Alexander Hauswald: "Such as?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "Not bringing you into new contracts with it, or pressuring you into a situation in which the
only solution is to make a contract..."
"...Not... um..."
"...I do not know the rules they play by, so it is difficult to create a contract adhering to them..."

over sun touched cheek, down the hollows of her throat, and stops just above the fullness of her bosom.
Rickert: "You wanna get bit sugar?"
"Cause you got ma rattle shakin'."
Rockett Rimjob looks at him with an absolutely lecherous countenance, letting out a hot breath right into

Rockett Rimjob: "A little chit-chat never hurt no-one..."
(To Scotty): Rickert uses one deft hand to unbuckle his black trousers. It takes a good tug to get them to
fall.When they pass his calves, something meaty, warm, and thick springs up into the crevice of Rockett's shapely
butt.
Rickert: "Well, I decided to make little Miss Rita an offer she couldn't refuse."

Rockett Rimjob: what the bollocks is my target then
Rickert: Since this is an opposed roll to Rickert's seduction skill.
Rockett Rimjob: oh
Rickert: And you didn't beat him by that much this time.
Rockett Rimjob: that's
concerning
Rickert: It should be.
"Course she did sugar."
"With a carrot like that danglin' in front of her."
Rockett Rimjob: "No kiddin'..."
(To Scotty): Rickert hums in pleasure as Rockett starts to grind on his tool. He gently undoes Rockett's shirt and
takes hold of her left breast with his hand. His fingers are calloused. They feel rough when tweaks Rockett's nipple
and squeezes her generous titflesh.
Rickert: "I got her some cash and got her motivated towards my club."
"So I could take care of her, proper like."
Rockett Rimjob: "She do good work?"
Rickert: "From what she showed me, I could tell she had talent."
"Silvery voice."
"...and a golden throat."
(From Rockett Rimjob): She takes in a deep breath as he grabs her funbag, looking up at him over her shoulder
as her hips rock up and down. She keeps herself steady, hands planted on the mattress.
Rockett Rimjob: "Knew how ta take it?"
Rickert: "Not at first, but she picked it up fast."
"She...ascertained from my reactions, what was a good idea, and what was a bad idea."
(To Scotty): Rickert continues to tease Rockett's breasts with gentle squeezes and pinches. He pulls his hips
back from hers slow, until the tip of his length is barely touching Rockett's hot mound.
Rockett Rimjob: "Take it y--nnh... y' had ta do some... convincin'? Lord knows throatin' don't come easy..."
Rickert: "Well, when you got money in one hand, fame in the other, and good looks..."
(From Rockett Rimjob): Her body sloooowly pushes back, grinding Rickert's head against her sex, slipping along
her lips and slickening it with her juices. She doesn't give him the pleasure of penetration, however -- once their
hips meet, he'd feel the soft skin of her belly on his length.
Rickert: "It tends to make the convincin' a little easier."
"You bad little girl, playing with me like that."
"I'll have to return the favor."
Rockett Rimjob: "Money's a hell of a talker..."

"...this, thing, though..."
"...maybe Ah jus' wanna have some fun~"
(To Scotty): Rickert's finger slides over Rockett's dripping cunny. He finds her button after a few seconds of
stroking and begins to run a light finger over it. The mattress squeaks as he shifts and the finger against her
button is replaced by an agile tongue.
Rickert: "Well maybe..."
(To Scotty): Rickert takes a nice, long, langorous lick of Rockett's sizzling slit.
Rickert: "I can help you out with that."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Alright.
We'll do the rest of that later.

It is time.

Callie and Cassie find the re-purposed marshalry close to Doc Mitchell's cabin. There are guns sticking out the

Manson strolls around the corner of the building with a rifle stock pressed to his shoulder. He looks like
he's wearing a mask, but he's cut a hole in the mouthpiece tor a cigarette.
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers gives him a small wave as she approaches, hands nowhere near her gun or
whip. "Howdy there!"
Manson shakes his head until the smoking cigarette drops from his mouth. He puts the sights of his rifle
on Callie.
Manson: "Business?"
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: "Jus' here ta talk. We don' want no trouble now."
Manson: "Talk 'bout what?"
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: "Well, Ah heard tell of some Southerners like myself holed up here and figgered y'all
must feel a might far from home."
Manson: "Feelin' fine."
"And I got enough bastard to shoot the shit with in there."
Manson jerks his head towards the building.
Manson: "So, you're looking like good target practice."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers shows her star. "Y'all wouldn't shoot a Ranger down in cold blood, would ya?
Names Corporal Callie Mathers of the Texas Rangers."
Cassie-May O'Brien rests the butt of her shotgun on her hip, keeping the flag up.
Manson doesn't respond for a moment. The rifle moves a bit further back against his shoulder. Then, a
white gloved hand reaches around the building and touches the masked man on the shoulder.
Manson: "What?"
"..."
Manson lets the rifle drop to his side with clear irritation. He walks back around the side of the building. A
door slams loud enough for both Callie and Cassie to hear.
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers smirks. "Well, ain't he just a people-person?"
Wonderful Cowboy Land: A man wearing a well pressed Confederate uniform walks around the corner of the
building. He has a pistol and saber belted to his hips. His mustache is impeccable. One white gloved hand raises
in greeting.
The Major: "Hello madam."
Cassie-May O'Brien wave-waves the flag a little, raising her eyebrows.
The Major: "I hope that I may apologize for the behavior of my man."
"He's been a little cagey, as of late."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: "T'ain't nothin'. With times as they are, makes sense ta be a little wary."

The Major strokes his mustache with one hand as he speaks.
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: "Jus' lendin' a helpin' hand ta the Marshalry. Ah could ask y'all the same question.
What's a buncha fine Southern folk doin' holed up in these parts?"
The Major lowers his head and grinds his boot into the dirt for a few moments. He raises his boot and
stamps the soil underneath him down flat. He raises his head back up.
The Major: "I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to say."
"Circumstances arose, and we were...called to action. Here."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: "An' the hostility to the locals? Ah'm sure they'd be more'n willin' ta help if they didn't
have guns trained on 'em all the time."
The Major: "A...precaution."
"What we are doing here is highly important."
dimVitrarius: sorry, back in a moment
The Major: "We can't have the locals interfering."
"Therefore, we present something that is dangerous to the curious, so that we might perform our duties
unmolested."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: "Don' ya think that'll jus' draw more around or even worse, the local lawmen?"
The Major: "The local lawman has vacated his position."
"We are now the law in these parts."
Cassie-May O'Brien: bk
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: "That's not how the locals are seein' it. Ah'm sure if ya talked to 'em that ya'd be able
ta let 'em know they gotta stay clear and there'd be far less trouble. 'Specially if ya got a Ranger backin' ya up."
The Major strokes his beard.
The Major: "Perhaps."
The Major points to Cassie.
The Major: "What affiliation is your friend there?"
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: "That's Cassie. She's also helpin' out the Marshalry. She'd jus' fine, far as Ah'm
concerened."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Howdy."
The Major: "That is wonderful, but I would like to know her relation to the Confederacy."
"Sympathizer, another Ranger perhaps?"
Cassie-May O'Brien looked over at Callie.
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: "Naw, she's not a Ranger and she wasn't blessed ta come from Dixie. But she's the
kinda gal ta help anyone who needs it."
The Major strokes his mustache for a solid minute.

"I'm afraid that I would be more comfortable with your friend outside."
"She can talk to Fenwick."
"Is that agreeable?"

"Or, a quartermaster."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Uh."

The Major: "I hit a target this week."
"I might even hit two."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Think Ah can git this down now,"
Cassie-May O'Brien put her shoygun between her legs and untied the white blouse off it.
The Major throws out a hand towards the young soldier sitting on the bench just inside.
The Major: "This is Mannok, he's the only private in our unit. Little skittish sometimes, but a good boy."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers tips her hat to him. "Howdy."
Mannok looks up to Callie. His eyes have obvious bags under them. His head nods its way back down a
second later.
Cassie-May O'Brien folded her blouse and stuffed it back in her backpack.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...So, quartermaster, eh?"
The Major: "He's just a little tired is all."
"Come along now."
The Major strides further into the building.

Mundt Fedler turns to look at Callie. His gloves are stained with black grease, as is the rest of him.
Mundt Fedler: "Guten tag, frau."
Mundt Fedler turns back to the Gatling gun and continues greasing the mechanisms with a curious little
gun.

Manson doesn't look up. He concentrates on guzzling the contents of a large brown jug.
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers nods. "Yep, gave us quite the welcome."
Fenwick sighs theatrically and digs around in his interior coat pocket.
Fenwick: "AH suppose."
Fenwick pulls out a crinkled rolling paper and a tin of tobacco. He has a cigarette rolled up in under a
minute.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Musta git boring 'ere."

Wonderful Cowboy Land: Alright.
Extra stuff done.
Yuppie b.: good good
Wonderful Cowboy Land brings WHitney a long, tall, cool, glass of water. A slight frown creases his face
as he sets it down in front of the adventist.
Bartender: *
Whitney G. Elieen: "Thank you..."
Whitney G. Elieen grasps the small glass in her much larger hands
Bartender: "Nothin' else...?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "...do you...do you sell Cider by chance?"
Whitney G. Elieen carefully lifts the glass up to her lips
Whitney G. Elieen sips
Bartender: "I got a couple kegs."
Whitney G. Elieen: "I would like one glass of Cider please."
Bartender strolls a few feet over and grabs a mug off the bar's counter. He bends down. Gurgling noises
drift up from under the edge of the bar.
Whitney G. Elieen takes another sip before setting the glass down
Whitney G. Elieen takes a deep breath in
Whitney G. Elieen slowly lets it out
Bartender comes back up with a frothy mug. He walks back over to Whitney and sets it down in front of
her. The crackle of carbonation is still audible.

Bartender: "Quarter."
Whitney G. Elieen gives him said quarter
Whitney G. Elieen: "God bless."
Whitney G. Elieen slides the water away and replaces with the apple drink
Bartender slides the quarter across the wooden counter top. The shining piece of currency slips into his
apron pocket with a difficult to discern whisper of metal on cloth.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The froth in the mug is settling out a little. The actual liquid is a pale yellow filled with
tiny bubbles.
Whitney G. Elieen stares at the bubbly drink in the mug, almost mesmerized by the carbonation as she
lifts the glass slowly up to her lips.
Whitney G. Elieen closes her eyes and mumbles to herself. A silent prayer perhaps before she lifts it to
her lips and drinks deeply.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The liquid tickles the tongue as it flows down. There is a slight burn to it, but it is
difficult to feel amidst the tickling bubbles. Sweet and bright, with a minute bitterness that follows behind. The drink
feels autumnal as the red and orange of dying leaves.
Bartender: "Good?"
Whitney G. Elieen sets the glass down after a time. She would drink this as sensibly as she could. There
was a certain beauty to the drink. One that called to mind thoughts of autumn. Of falling leaves and dying
trees...
Whitney G. Elieen looks up and smiles
Whitney G. Elieen: "Yes...very."
Bartender gives a short grunt of approval. His idle hands grab an empty mug off the counter. He grabs a
stained white cloth off his shoulder and begins polishing the mug.
Whitney G. Elieen: "I imagine this drink is popular this time of year. I think I like it better than the others..."
Bartender: "Popular all year round."
Whitney G. Elieen: "After years of drinking water alone, it feels refreshing to have something different."
Bartender: "Mmmm."
"Only water?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "Only water."
"The body is a temple. I try to tend to it well."

Whitney G. Elieen glances down at the drink in her hands
Whitney G. Elieen slowly raises it for another sip
Whitney G. Elieen: "More stressful...far more stressful."
Bartender: "Mmmm."
"Do what I can to help."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: There's not much left in the mug Whitney. Conservative drinking and eating was never
your strong suit. It isn't helped by the thirst and hunger that matches your size.
Whitney G. Elieen: "..."
"May I have another please?"
Bartender takes the mug and looks into it for a long second. He shrugs, walks over to the keg under the
bar, and fills it back up. The refreshed mug is before Whitney in less than a minute.

Bartender ransacks the bartop for a larger mug, ensures it is clean, and fills it full of cider. He sets it down

move. Three obvious options present themselves. Go see the patient at Doc Mitchell's and see if you can get
some info out of her. Further investigate the disappearance of the town marshal, Sydney Gallows. Third option is
to get really drunk and have a duel with each other.

Wonderful Cowboy Land: Well.

Wonderful Cowboy Land: They didn't have their legs sitting a few feet away from them.
Or...
A huge hole in their chest where the heart should be.

Crystal Saint Claire: Like, this wasn't just a catastrophic cannon backfire
Rockett Rimjob audibly vomits outside with alarming volume.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Judging by the fact that the corpse pushed against the far wall has dynamite in his
hand.
It was probably that.
Crystal Saint Claire: Ah.
Crystal Saint Claire investigates!
Alexander Hauswald looks around, maybe at the rectangles.
Crystal Saint Claire: "So... whatever WAS killing them..."
"I think... maybe this man killed it with dynamite? Or.. at least tried to?"
Does it look like he was killed by dynamite?
Or are there bullet holes in him, or big flesh rips
Rockett Rimjob: "...What the hell..?"
Wonderful Cowboy Land: He is missing the lower half of his body.
Yes.
He looks like he got blown to shit and back.
Alexander Hauswald: "...Rockett? That you?"
Crystal Saint Claire searches the guy's torso
Crystal Saint Claire: "Why is he here..."
"If he was the last to die, which he would have been if he'd resorted to trying to blow someone up with dynamite..."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: There is a small book next to him.
Rockett Rimjob: "...yeah, Hauswald... heard some ruckus, then some not-ruckus."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Why didn't he run?"
Rockett Rimjob: "...Christ above, tha hell happened here?"
Crystal Saint Claire picks up the book.
Alexander Hauswald: "...Something... some massacre happened here."

Wonderful Cowboy Land: Normal looking.
Two eights, both black and one ace of clubs.
Crystal Saint Claire: ...

Yes
Rockett Rimjob: "Whoever tha hell did this, they were real keen on makin' a display."
Crystal Saint Claire: All that's missing is Club Ace and mystery card...

Spade Ace.
That's three of the four known cards in the Dead Man's hand.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Does Crystal open the book?
Alexander Hauswald: "... Rockett, do me a favor and see if you can find another card somewhere."
Crystal Saint Claire: Yes.
Crystal's gonna take a look

Wonderful Cowboy Land: Everything is written in code.
Crystal Saint Claire: READING RAINBOOOOOOOW

Wonderful Cowboy Land: Except the last page.
Alexander Hauswald: "I'm curious about something."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: it is stuck together with congealing blood.
Crystal Saint Claire: GongealING?
Crystal might have something in her little lab that could fix that.
Getting pages unstuck is prob'ly something most lab-workers have to do pretty often

Crystal Saint Claire: Crystal looks for something to hold the pages open.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Rockett, this corpse has had both legs severed at about the knee.
And there is a massive, crudely hacked out hole where his heart should be.
Crystal Saint Claire: A piece of wood or soemthing.
"White?"
Wonderful Cowboy Land: You pick up a stick of dynamite and put it on the book.
Crystal Saint Claire: >Quality bookmark
Alexander Hauswald: Anything left for me to find?
Wonderful Cowboy Land: There are weapons on each corpse, mostly one shot rifles and Colt Navys.
Rockett Rimjob: "...looks like someone had fun tearin' up through here..."
Rockett Rimjob looks at the body, as well as the desk to her right.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The desk has two forty four caliber pistols on it, and a good Bowie knife.

Wonderful Cowboy Land: The corpse has a sawn off shotgun next to it.
Double barrel.
Crystal Saint Claire: "We should probably go."
Alexander Hauswald: "... It's disrespectful but these guns might be worth something."
Crystal Saint Claire: "I would say 'we need to collect them for the marshalls' but I just remembered we are the
marshalls."
Alexander Hauswald: "...At least one of the gatling guns. Maybe you could do something with it."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: You'll need two people to carry that.
Or one Rockett.
Alexander Hauswald ponders.
Alexander Hauswald: "...Thing we should ask Rockett or carry it ourselves?"
Rockett Rimjob takes some time looking at the guns. She seems to really like the look of the doublebarrel.
Rockett Rimjob: "...whoever rolled through here didn't do it fer tha money, that's fer sure."
"Coulda bagged a lot of crap."
UrbanCritter: "I got a feeling it was some ghost."
Rockett Rimjob: "Ghost?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "Ghost, likely not."
Alexander Hauswald: "Or someone with very skewed priorities."
Rockett Rimjob: "Well, grab what ya can. Not like these poor bastards are usin' 'em no more."
Alexander Hauswald: "Not... GHOST, ghost."
"Someone who came back."
Crystal Saint Claire: "I almost hate to ask, but would someone mind checking some of the holes in them?"
"For bullets?"
Alexander Hauswald: "....Bullets?"
Rockett Rimjob: "Looks like someone just kinda went ham with some caveman bullshit."
Crystal Saint Claire: "...The man in the back... he used dynamite."
"That would imply he was fighting something he believed guns wouldn't help against, likely because he had
watched his armed companions try to deal with them."
Rockett Rimjob looks at the mounted gatling.
Rockett Rimjob looks to see if there's a way to take it off the mount.
Crystal Saint Claire: "I am unsure anything with thick enough armor, natural or otherwise, would be capable of
weidling a firearm with any degree of effectiveness."

Rockett Rimjob does so.
Alexander Hauswald examines the corpses for bullet holes.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: SKRRRRRANK
Rockett is now the proud owner of a Gatling gun.
(From Rockett Rimjob): can I have control of it
Crystal Saint Claire makes an unholy shrieky scream
Rockett Rimjob looks at it.

Crystal Saint Claire tries to jump and run at the same time and trips
Rockett Rimjob looks at poor Crystal.

Alexander Hauswald looks at Crystal, amused.
Rockett Rimjob: "...yeah that wus pretty loud.
Rockett Rimjob points the gun at the wall.
Crystal Saint Claire: "..."
Alexander Hauswald: "...Heh."
Any bullet holes, Scotty?
Rockett Rimjob: The one I looked at just had a giant hole in its chest.
Not sure about the others.
Alexander Hauswald: Bullet holes. Not "got his heart torn out" holes.
Rockett Rimjob: If there were, Doc didn't mention 'em, so I'd assume not.
Rockett Rimjob checks to see if the darn thing is still loaded at all.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: You gotta look for stuff.
Then I can mention it.
Unless you would notice it without putting effort into looking.
Looks like...yep.
Still loaded.
Alexander Hauswald: So were these dudes shot or not?
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The one on the left looks like he got his leg torn off by a couple bullets.

"Even more so that there is no body to speak of..."
Alexander Hauswald: "Whatever this thing was, it had a gun."
Rockett Rimjob: "How many shots?"
Alexander Hauswald: "...And was pretty good at it."
Rockett Rimjob: "We got a marksman?"

Rockett Rimjob thinks back to her friend that got blammo'd outside Mitchell's.
Crystal Saint Claire thinks about what Whitney would like for lunch
Alexander Hauswald thinks about something else.

Alexander Hauswald: "...Grab what you want and let's leave."
Rockett Rimjob: "...yeah. Let's."
Alexander Hauswald: "Try to see if any of these folks were lawmen, though."
Alexander Hauswald appropriates the two colt navies and the bowie knife.

Wonderful Cowboy Land: All of the boxes appear to be ammo for the Gatling.
Thirty shots to a box.
Fifty caliber.
Rockett Rimjob: All the grey boxes?
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Yep.
You can probably carry one with the Gatling.
Rockett Rimjob: I can count eight in here, there was one outside too.
I take it I can't stuff all of it in my backpack like the TFN loot system.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Nope.
Alexander Hauswald: Can I help her carry some?
Wonderful Cowboy Land: You can carry the Gatling and the rest of what you got.
Yes.
Alexander Hauswald: "Need help?"
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Alex can carry two boxes, since he's not also going to be carrying a Gatling Gun.
Rockett Rimjob: "Grab a couple of them boxes. Gun ain't worth much if it ain't got bullets."
Rockett Rimjob grabs one (1) box.
Alexander Hauswald grabs two. Maybe straps one to Sacks, too.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Yes to the first.

Crystal Saint Claire: "I could care less about the contents, honestly. If you want to just tell us anything written in
there that is relevant, and keep the journal... I would not object."
Sackhead: "Congratulations."
Sackhead tucks the journal into an inside pocket of her coat.
Alexander Hauswald: "...Miss. Please."
Rockett Rimjob: "Hauswald, don't be a jackass."
Crystal Saint Claire: "She can keep it."
Rockett Rimjob: "If she don't wanna tell us, she don't have to. Not like it's gonna stop our searchin'."
Sackhead produces an especially ragged cough.
Crystal Saint Claire: "...I would not be able to break the code..."
"Are you unwell?"
Sackhead: "Are they...all dead?"
Rockett Rimjob: "...poor woman's gotta heal. Don't need tha stress."
Crystal Saint Claire looks concerned.
Alexander Hauswald: "How many of them were there?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "...How many of them were there?"
Alexander Hauswald: "We counted six."
Crystal Saint Claire: "We found... six... and a half."
Rockett Rimjob: "They are deader than dead. An' there wasn't a breathin' soul in tha whole place."
"If there was anyone that didn't die, they ran, far an' fast."
Sackhead: "There were seven."
"Not including me."
Alexander Hauswald: "...Guess someone's alive?"
Crystal Saint Claire: So perhaps a survivor.

"I feel that may be the key, deciphering what that means in context."

"Would you mind taking a look?"

"Make sure no one touches that place."
Alexander Hauswald: "Will do."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Understood!"
Alexander Hauswald: "We wanted to get the dead here so Doc could get a better look."
Crystal Saint Claire: "...Rockett you should probably put the gatling gun back
Sackhead: "I don't give a shit about the guns."
"I give a shit about my friends."
"God KAAAF dammit."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Rules of maritime salvage dictate you get the guns. Your friends are dead, you need every
advantage you can get."
Sackhead: "Do you think I can carry a fucking Gatling gun?"
"I can barely carry my ass."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Not for long, but money is nice."
Rockett Rimjob: "You look like you got a decent throwin' arm."
"Don't look healthy enough ta breathe, though. That's tha problem."
Crystal Saint Claire: "You are sick right now, are you not?"
Sackhead: "I got."
"My chest."
"Torn open."
Alexander Hauswald: "You're doing pretty well for someone who did."
Crystal Saint Claire: "That is a maybe."
(Do we know what tore her chest open?)
Rockett Rimjob: "Was gonna say. Most folks would've given up on breathin' with a hole like that."
"You must be real stubborn."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: (Something)
Crystal Saint Claire: (That is the exact opposite of helpful)
Alexander Hauswald: "...MInd if I be rude and ask..."
"What exactly tore your chest?"
Sackhead: "God and the Devil can both suck my clit."
"I didn't wanna die."
"So, I didn't."
Sackhead turns to Hauswald with her begoggled face. Light glints off the tinted glass.

"Long teeth."
"Smelled like shit and Shinola mixed together."
Alexander Hauswald: "... White."
Crystal Saint Claire: "...white."
Sackhead turns back to Rockett.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Perhaps it returned?"
Alexander Hauswald tries to remember if he ever heard of something like that.
Crystal Saint Claire: "But there were bullet holes in some of the men..."
Sackhead: "Not about my pleasure, I'm bettin' both of them are hell on wheels for eating carpet."
Rockett Rimjob chuckles at that. "Ah like yer attitude."
Sackhead: "Thanks."
Alexander Hauswald: (Anything, Doc? Nothing I gotta roll Occult for?)
Sackhead: "You're part of a privileged few."
(There's a lot of white things.)
(Ask more questions.)
(Use the stuff you know)
Alexander Hauswald: "...Anything else you remember about it? I know about.... unusual things like that."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers checks her Ranger's Bible for anything like that
Sackhead: "I think it...had a gun in one hand when it was trying to tear my everything out."
"Probably."
"Hard to tell."
"There was a lot of my blood all over."
Crystal Saint Claire: White, long teeth...
Had a gun.
(From Rockett Rimjob): does size affect token size
Alexander Hauswald: "... White, long teeth, smelled horrid, had a gun..."
Alexander Hauswald ponders harder.
Alexander Hauswald: (A hillbilly klansman?)

"Do you remember anything else about its face other than teeth? hair? eyes? Did it wear clothes?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "..."

Crystal Saint Claire realizes something.
Crystal Saint Claire loses control of her legs, and hits the ground.
Sackhead: Callie, there's vampires, albinos, other assorted undead, drownies, and wendigos, and a couple
others.
Rockett Rimjob: "We talkin' hick, Swede, or albino white?"
Sackhead: "Baby batter white."
Alexander Hauswald: "... Right. Did the gun have anything special to it?"
Sackhead: "Old."
"Rusty."
"Looked small caliber."
"Navy, maybe?"
Crystal Saint Claire has buried her head in her knees, curled tight in a ball.
Alexander Hauswald: "...Maybe something like..."
Alexander Hauswald looks at Crystal.
Alexander Hauswald: "...Cedric?"
Sackhead: "Who the fuck is Cedric?"
Alexander Hauswald: "Someone who didn't know how to stay dead. Nearly chewed all of our faces off."
"...If we take you to the cemetary and show you what's left of it, will you tell us if it's that?"
"...Assuming it didn't get up and leave."
Sackhead: "Fine, yeah."
Alexander Hauswald: "...There's too many damn dead things getting up lately."

"They have taken the bridge… and the second hall. We have barred the gates… but cannot hold them for long.
The ground shakes. Drums… drums… in the deep. We cannot get out. A shadow moves in the dark. We cannot

Doc (GM): I have the musics.
Poage: Ok what about one that says....
"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is
impossible."

Doc (GM): ...mother
Well.
Poage: Okay let's try one more
Doc (GM): It's Flight of The Bumblebee.
So.
Poage: Do you have something that says
"I bet your dad is so disappointed. Who wants to raise a man who plays with Madrid? Do you always take the easy
way? Do you work at Target and go to the local community college? I bet he asks you how that degree is coming
like 3 times a month. It’s always the same though, isn’t it. That tinge of shame, then a small outburst. “I’m working
on it dad, and my app is gonna take off”. But there is no app, is there. There’s no hope. Just loneliness."
After that, we get to the DOING THINGS
If you got nothin' that's fine

Wonderful Cowboy Land: Whitney wakes up from her night of cider intake with a slight headache and a note
next to her head.
Whitney G. Elieen lets out a great big yawn...and an equally mighty groan as she reaches forward and
takes the note into her hands. Her holy mug sitting right next to her. As full as ever.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: On the note is scrawled, "Doc Mitchell's" One of your companions must have left it, or
the Bartender.
Whitney G. Elieen lets the note fall to the floor...
Whitney G. Elieen yawns again before pulling herself up off the bed. How late was it...? She was not used
to sleeping in so late. To say the very least.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Do the Whitney head to Mitchell's place?
Whitney G. Elieen: Yes. She would shamble her way towards the place.
(From Poage): is it the next morning?
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Nah, this would be later that same day.
Righto.
The way is easy enough Whitney. You do not meet too much trouble along the way. There seems to be a tension
in the air though. Not of something waiting to spring, more akin to the quiet after a gunshot. When you make it to
Mitchell's, you see Crystal outside talking to a horse. Inside are the others. They appear to be embroiled in a
discussion with the woman who was hurt before. Perhaps it would be best not to disturb them.
Poage: (Wait, I thought Crystal was inside...)
Wonderful Cowboy Land: (She came outside to talk to the horse a bit more)
(Because he's probably the smartest one here, apart from her and Sacks.)
Crystal Saint Claire: (my web is down . I'm currently on phone)
Crystal Saint Claire is outside, curled up, mumbling something to the horse.
Whitney G. Elieen can not help but smile as she makes her approach
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The horse knickers softly.
Whitney G. Elieen: "Hello Crystal...I see you have made a friend."
Crystal Saint Claire almost shoots Whitney, jumps a solid three feet back, and curls up like a turtle.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The horse is displeased.
Crystal Saint Claire is huddled behind the remains of the cart, peeking out and noticing who it is.

Crystal Saint Claire: "he's back..."
"he's back and he's killing people and he knows where we are i just know it an ah'm scared out've m'mind"
Whitney G. Elieen: "..."
Crystal Saint Claire trails off into panicked breaths.
Whitney G. Elieen 's expression turns from one of shock to concern and finally something a little
more...distant. Though that did not tighten her grip on the little one. Not in the slightest.
Whitney G. Elieen: "Shhh...It is going to be okay..."
"Be calm Crystal...I am here. Nothing is going to hurt you..."
Crystal Saint Claire: "...I won't go with him"
"I will out a bullet in my head before I let him take me"

"The lady inside has it. She survived him."

"Considering the pain I felt...it is a small wonder she survived as long as she did. This is who the others are
speaking to right now?"
"What reason have you to not trust her?"
Poage: "...she survived."
Crystal Saint Claire: *
Whitney G. Elieen: "You suspect foul play in this?"
Poage: "...he wiped out a fortified position manned by members of the Confederate military single-handed Lu."
Crystal Saint Claire: Handedly*
"...a thing capable of single-handedly decimating a small fort was unable to kill her? No."
"If he wanted her dead, she would be dead."
"Therefore he wanted her wounded badly enough that she would require a doctor's care, possibly Doctor
Mitchell's."
"Therefore he wanted her here."
"There fore I do not trust her here."
Whitney G. Elieen: "...the fruit of paranoia and fear or of observation and truth? I might agree with you on that
point. Either an act of God had saved her, or her being alive is by some dark design."
"God will help us I know. But God also helps those who help themselves. They most of all."
"In light of this, what would you do, Crystal, to prepare for the possibility?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "I don't know..."
"It would not be right to force her to leave while she still requires medical attention"
"But it is entirely possible he has infected her with some plague, or planted some unholy progeny within her."
Whitney G. Elieen: "And what makes you think this my Crystal?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "...he uses people."
"women... Children..."
"people who cannot help themselves."
Whitney G. Elieen: "That he does...It is within the dark realm of his mind that he can concoct these horrors..."
"But we must focus on what is in front of us first. What we can know. Maybe the good Doctor has made some
observations..."
Crystal Saint Claire: "..."
Whitney G. Elieen reaches to the side of her pack and produces a mug wrapped tight in cloth.
Crystal Saint Claire holds tight onto Whitney
Whitney G. Elieen: "For your nerves." She said as she unwraps the still full mug of cider.
"Do not drink too much...make not my mistake."
Crystal Saint Claire takes a sip. If it's alcoholic cider, she does a spit-take.

Crystal Saint Claire nods.
Crystal Saint Claire surgically attaches herself to Whitney's leg using a Hemmlot-Ulman Graft... Or HUG...
Crystal Saint Claire hugs Whitney's leg.
Crystal Saint Claire: "You are better for my nerves."
Whitney G. Elieen could not help but smile as she wraps her mug back up. Placing a hand right at the
center of Crystal's back, pushing her that much closer into her tall leg and long, flowing green dress.
Whitney G. Elieen: "And you, my dear, are a welcome sight to my weary eyes."
"Like a thousand and one sips of this very mug"
Crystal Saint Claire makes a noise that sounds like a sigh, then takes a deep breath.
Crystal Saint Claire: "...maybe you can help her... Just... Please. Do not cause yourself irreparable bodily harm."
Whitney G. Elieen: "I did it once before have I not?" She says softly. With a smile. "If more is needed I will be
happy to provide it."
"And this time, God willing, I won't almost lose my leg."
Crystal Saint Claire: "..."
Crystal Saint Claire hugs tighter. She's gotten a little stronger, to the point where you can tell when she's
holding on.
Whitney G. Elieen: "Crystal...what a grip you have? It seems our mornings together are producing fruit!"
Crystal Saint Claire: "I am slightly stronger now! I can do almost fifteen push-ups consistently."
Whitney G. Elieen: "That is excellent! I am so proud of you...~"
Whitney G. Elieen hugs a little tighter!
Whitney G. Elieen: "Soon you will be as strong as me in no time at all!"
"...well maybe after a few years." She says with a giggle.
Crystal Saint Claire: "God and my hormone production willing..."
"Then you won't have to treat me like a Ming vase!"
(Good night all!)
"Perhaps not probable, but I... do not hold much, if anything, beneath..."

Wonderful Cowboy Land: Hauswald, you can see that the sigil is not carved onto the skull, but burnt onto it. The
burning does not appear to have caused any trauma to the flesh, only to the bone, as there is no scar tissue from
a previous incision. The sigil was somehow burnt into the skull without damaging anything else, which should be
physically impossible.
Alexander Hauswald: "...Someone burnt this onto the skull."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: "But wouldn't that show on the skin?"
Alexander Hauswald: "That's the thing."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...How the...?
Alexander Hauswald: "There's no sign of anything."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: "...Fucking magic."
Alexander Hauswald tries to see if the magic comes from the star itself or not.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: You can tell, it is coming from the star.
You do not touch it while ascertaining this.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...So, do we break that star with a rock, or...?"
Alexander Hauswald: "...I'm going to do something stupid and touch the star."
Rockett Rimjob: "Hauswald don't die."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers: "If anything happens, that hand's comin' off."
Alexander Hauswald takes a deep breath and touches the star.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Everything stops.
None of you can perceive the stopping, save for Hauswald.
But Hauswald can only watch.
And listen.

Wonderful Cowboy Land: Rockett makes her way to the outskirts of town in a horse drawn carriage with Dobray.
The interior of the carriage is more spacious than most, but feels as small as all the rest due to the pile of Russian
meat sitting across from her.
Dobray: "Miss Natasha iz excite to see you."
"Everything oiled down."
"Everything."
Rockett Rimjob: "'Cludin' her, Ah hope."
Dobray: "Da."
"Should be arrive in second or three."
Rockett Rimjob: "Perfect."
Dobray turns and knocks on the wall of the carriage between himself and the driver. He lets loose a string
of Russian syllables and waits a moment. He gets a short word in reply and smiles.
Rockett Rimjob: "We here?"
Dobray boots open the door of the carriage.

UrbanCritter: Excuse me. My net decided to fuck off.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Alex excuses himself from the company of his friends and treks to town alone. He
looks over the facade of the square for a particular type of shop. He has no concrete idea of what it looks like, only
a feeling. He soon spots a place that matches that feeling. A shop sign with no filligree, in muted colors and
flowing script that reads, "Gohvis Books."
Alexander Hauswald: "...Seems like the right place. Wait here, Sacks."
Sacks: "[Buy me a book, okay? I'm behind on my reading.]"
Alexander Hauswald: "[I'll see if they stock Dickens."
Sacks: "[Thanks, boss.]"
Alexander Hauswald walks inside, looking around.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The door creaks a bit as you enter. Warm air envelops Hauswald with a gentle,
beguiling embrace. The smell of the musty pages comes next. It tickles the nose with the promise of knowledge,
old and refined, like wine. There is a small sitting area, and a desk beyond that, and the bookshelves, the many
bookshelves. There is a man at the desk, bent over a tome with delicate tools in his thin hands.
Alexander Hauswald ltakes silent steps as if to not interrupt. "... excuse me."
Gohvis does not look up from his work. He finishes applying something from a pot sitting next to his
elbow into the book and settling a page into place. Then, he raises his aquiline features to Alex.
Gohvis: "Will you be needing, assistance?"
Alexander Hauswald: "I think I will.
Gohvis: "Mmmm."
Alexander Hauswald: I'm looking for a... Specific book. The newer editions are butchered beyond relief."
Gohvis sets his tools down and covers the pot with his lid.
Gohvis: "I'm sure..."
Gohvis rises from his chair and dusts off the legs of his corduroy trousers.
Alexander Hauswald shrugs. "You probably heard people talk about it before. Hoyle's Book of Games?"
Gohvis: "Of course."
"Which edition, would you like?"
Gohvis clasps his hands behind himself and peers down at Alex through his half moon spectacles.
Alexander Hauswald: "The earlier the better. If I didn't know better I'd ask for first or second but those are
collector's items nowadays."
Gohvis: "Mmmmm."
Gohvis strolls over to a shelf behind Alex and pulls a black hardback down.

Alexander Hauswald: "The fact you stock it is one."
"At least, you USED to stock it."
Gohvis: "This place stocks many books."
"It is not altogether improbable for you to find the one you are looking for."
"That costs extra."
Alexander Hauswald: "Right. How expensive are we talking?"

Alexander Hauswald: "Money. Guns."
Alexander Hauswald fishes one of the unidentified coins.
Alexander Hauswald: "These, if they mean anything to you."
Gohvis: (back inna tick)
UrbanCritter: (poke?)
Gohvis: Back.
Gohvis stretches one hand forward and plucks the coin out of Alex's hand. He turns it over a few times,
squinting and widening his eyes to get a good look at it. His other hand drifts to his mouth and taps at his
cheek.
Gohvis: "Interesting, yes..."
"I could get a lot of books with this."
Gohvis looks Alex in the eyes.
Gohvis: "Do you have any more?"
UrbanCritter: "I need to ask. What ARE these coins?"
UrbanCritter reaches to his pocket and pulls the rest.

related."
Gohvis: "Indeed, he was a good writer."
Alexander Hauswald: "Well, things more substantial than penny dreadfuls. Personally about what the Injuns call
'The Hunting Ground' magic rituals and such. Things about monsters, too."
Gohvis: "May his spirit rest in peace."
"Mmmm..."
"Regrettably, I do not have much in stock of that."
"Their culture is...not easy to win trust with."

"I can also recommend a Dickens for your friend."

"Hmm."
"Perhaps, be more considerate in the future."
"Or you will quickly run up a tab."
Alexander Hauswald: "Of course, sir."
Alexander Hauswald has the barest hint of a grin.
Gohvis turns up the intensity of his glare a notch. One thing hand stretches out and his fingers snap
again. Alex's shoes slide forward and stop right in front of Gohvis' desk.
Gohvis: "Seven."
Alexander Hauswald: "...Seven dubloons?"

Gohvis: "Seven ears of corn."
"Of course seven doubloons."
Alexander Hauswald: "Can we settle on five?"
Gohvis slides three books off the pile.
Gohvis: "Yes."
Alexander Hauswald: "...Fair enough."
Alexander Hauswald rolls his eyes and slides seven dubloons over.
Gohvis sets the other books back, takes the coins from Alex, and slides the books over to him.
Gohvis: "A pleasure."
Alexander Hauswald examines the book, starting with the book of Games.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: On the front is the title of the book. Underneath that, is a large four.
All in silver lettering on jet black cover.
Alexander Hauswald: "...Fourth Edition, huh?"
Gohvis: "Yes."
Alexander Hauswald: "...Fairly recent. We're, what, fifth, sixth edition nowadays?"
Gohvis: "Yes."
I hear they're working on a seventh already."
Alexander Hauswald: "...Well, suppose this is the best you have? Every edition has someone edit out another
chunk of the important stuff."
Gohvis: "I know."
"It is the best you are currently getting."
Alexander Hauswald: "...Hm.
Do tell me if you ever get an earlier one, then."
Gohvis: "I will endeavor to inform you."
Alexander Hauswald: "This'll do fine for the moment."
Gohvis: "Excellent."
Alexander Hauswald collects the books and nods at Gohvis.
Alexander Hauswald: "... Actually..."
Gohvis inclines his head a degree to Alex.
Alexander Hauswald: "I want to ask about something else. Less related to books."
"I"m looking for my brother. A bit taller than me, darker hair. Last time I saw him he was clean shaven."

Alexander Hauswald tries to remember who exactly took him. Something about a pale man?
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Pale man, bullets don't do much to him, and appears to have a penchant for causing
trouble wherever he is seen. Including your former beat.
Alexander Hauswald: "Pale man. Trouble all around him, bullets didn't do much. You seen someone like that,
heard anything?"
Gohvis: "I have heard certain rumors about that individual, or one that matches that description."
"Rumor though."
Alexander Hauswald: "Any bit helps."
Gohvis: "Unsubstantiated and difficult to verify."
"Several of them do have an interesting common tidbit though."
Alexander Hauswald: "Do tell, Mr. Gohvis."
Gohvis: "Well, since you've patronized my shop so thoroughly, I will."
"Relation to the 'Indian' tribes."
"Many of the stories involve people getting warning from those people."
"Either directly, or indirectly."
Alexander Hauswald: "...What a coincidence. I'm headed to Wyoming soon."
Gohvis: "Keep an ear and eye open."
"Information like that is valuable."
"I'd certainly want it."
Alexander Hauswald: "Will do, Mr. Gohvis. Thank you and have a good day."
Gohvis: "You as well, Mister Hauswald."
"Do come again."
Alexander Hauswald: "I definitely will."
Alexander Hauswald nods and walks out, picking the Dickens book and giving it a quick look before
handing it to Sacks.
Sacks: "[Oh boy oh boy.]"
Sacks holds it with his mouth. Gently.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Sacks has gained 1 copy of Barnaby Rudge.

Sacks: Hurray!

Wonderful Cowboy Land: That's up to you.

Bartender: "Favors owed."
Bartender pulls a cloth out of his apron. It smells like beer. He holds it out to Alex.
Alexander Hauswald: "...Ah."
Bartender: "Clean up a little, you're a mess."
Alexander Hauswald wipes his face, trying to go from 'drunk' to 'capable'.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: As Alex wipes the cloth across his face, he senses a change in the atmosphere of the
room.
Alexander Hauswald: "I'm saying what I already said. I'll head to Wyoming when I'm done here-"
Wonderful Cowboy Land: "Yeah, yeah."
Horn: *
Horn lays both hands flat on the bartop and looks over Alex with his sunken sockets.
Horn: "I'm here to give you some detail."
Alexander Hauswald: "What, being cryptic got tiring?"
Alexander Hauswald sets his glass aside.
Horn: "No, there have been developments."
"I need to keep you abreast."
"Since we're business partners, and you will be representing me."
Alexander Hauswald: "Fair enough. Go ahead."
Sacks is wondering where his boss is.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Sacks, you are outside. You are tied to a post. You have a bone. The bone is good.
You also have your copy of Barnaby Rudge.
Sacks: [This is fine.]
Horn: "Right, you'll be going to Wyoming and will meet up with a contact of mine in the forest around the city of
Moose."
Alexander Hauswald: "... Eloquently named. What's his name?"
Horn: "He's old, he's Indian, and he could tear your throat out at a moment's notice."
"His name is Lyoop."
"Be polite."
Alexander Hauswald: "...Right. an old Indian called Lyoop. What's the occasion?"
Horn: "You need him to find a man."
"A man with a red right hand."

Alexander Hauswald: "... I'm going to need a little more detail, Horn."
Horn: "That's all the detail I can give you at the moment, other then what you need to do when you find my man."
Alexander Hauswald: "What do I need to do, then?"
Horn: "You need..."
Horn leans a little further over the counter of the bar, pushing a few mugs out of the way.
Horn: "To shake his red, right hand."
"Do not let anything stop you from doing this."
Alexander Hauswald: "...Shake his hand and bring him to Lyoop."
Horn: "Yes."
"Lyoop will have more for you when you get to him."
"He has to abide by fewer, restrictions."
Alexander Hauswald: "Strange rituals you're concocting."
"Still. I do this and we're even. Correct?"
Horn: "You do this, and all debts are paid."
"Mine to you."
"And yours to me."
Alexander Hauswald: "...Except one."
"Thomas."
Horn: "I know."
"This is the way to him."
Alexander Hauswald: "m.."
Horn takes his hands off the top of the bar and steps back. He holds both of them out to his side open
palmed.
Horn: "What?"
"Don't you trust me?"
Alexander Hauswald 's grip around the glass tightened.
Alexander Hauswald: "I'm worried, Horn.
"I know you hold your deals."
"It doesn't mean I'm any less worried."
Horn: "Good."
"That means you're not an idiot."
Alexander Hauswald: "But I want you to know something."
"If I end up being swindled. If I find my brother with a bullet in his head..."
Alexander Hauswald takes a long sip from his glass.

Alexander Hauswald: "Not even hell would keep me from getting justice."
Horn: "Good boast."
"If you haven't got anything else to intimidate me with, I'll be going."
"I've got other business needs seeing to."
"Much more pleasurable business."
Alexander Hauswald: "I believe that'll be all, yes."
"Goodbye, Horn."
Horn: "Bye Hauswald, enjoy your drink."
Alexander Hauswald looks at him coldly, and closes his eyes, rubbing his temples.
Horn takes a bottle of whiskey out from under the bar and pushes it over to Alex.
Alexander Hauswald examines it when he opens his eyes.
Horn holds out his hand.
Bartender: *
(Internal screaming)
Alexander Hauswald looks at it suspiciously. Before shaking.
Bartender: "..."
"I want my rag back."
Alexander Hauswald: "What- oh. Sorry. Dozed off."
Bartender: "No problem."
"Happens all the time."
Alexander Hauswald hands him his rag back, trying to pretend he didn't just shake the man's hand.
Bartender takes the stained piece of cloth and tucks it back into his apron.
Alexander Hauswald: "So. You said something or was it just the booze playing with my mind?"
Bartender: "Just telling you to make sure you don't out drink your own wallet."
Alexander Hauswald: "Oh. I think I'll be fine."
Alexander Hauswald idly examines the bottle Horn pulled out, before setting his glass.
Alexander Hauswald: "...I think I'll be done after this glass."
Bartender: "Alright."
"Tab is five dollars."
Alexander Hauswald: "((Horn's bottle is just whiskey, then?))
Alexander Hauswald slides a fiver on the counter, finishing his glass.
Alexander Hauswald: "Have a good evening, sir."

Wonderful Cowboy Land: The label says that it is a simple bottle of whiskey from a local distillery. Popping the
cap off and smelling the liquid inside tells you that is not the case. Smells older, more distinguished. It's probably
brandy.
(That's about all there is.)
Alexander Hauswald: "..."
Alexander Hauswald stashes the bottle. He'll have to get Cassie to take a better look.

Nevermore: But whatever, getting more Dodge is important.
Looks like no Rockett and no Whitney today.
UrbanCritter: Hang on, opening to see how much it would cost me to upgrade spirit to 2d8
...so hey yall
fun fact
We can't have more than ten chips at a time, according to the manual
Wonderful Cowboy Land: It has been an interesting time, but as of today it is time to do as sages past have said
time after time, get the hell out of Dodge. Normally, for the distance you folks need to travel, it would take a train
ride and a full set of horses. It is a good thing you are travelling with Rockett and her magical, mystical cooter. She
banged her way into getting passage for the lot of you on an expensive airship captained by one of the railroad
baronesses. You think it is a Miss Natasha, but everyone on the airship besides you guys speaks with a gratuitous
Russian accent that it renders their speech near incomprehensible. The important part is that the ship gets you
folks where you're going. It touches down just outside of Moose, Wyoming. Whitney, Crystal, the tiny bandit boy,
Callie, and Rockett stay behind to pray, fawn over Whitney, raid the pantry, search the town's bounty board, and
fuck the railroad baroness, respectively. The rest of you head out into the forest as Alex tries to explain what little
he knows about the current mission from hell.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Finally. Weather that doesn't make ya feel like yer boilin in yer own skin."
Alexander Hauswald: "..."
Alexander Hauswald just looks grimly into the horizon.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Yew've been real quiet the whole trip, Alex."
"...Care ta fill the rest of us in on what's goin on?"
Alexander Hauswald: "...More spooky stuff."
"Horn talked to me before we left."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: (Varmus are you back?)
dimVitrarius: yes just now
Wonderful Cowboy Land: The four of you emerge into a clearing. There's a burble of water nearby.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...An' whut 'e wants?"
Alexander Hauswald: "He told me who we're supposed to meet."
Cassie-May O'Brien: I only see white screen with Alex's token
Wonderful Cowboy Land: I assume it's still loading then.
Alexander Hauswald: "There's an old Indian called Lyoop. He's our contact here, and he's not bound by Manitou
bullshit so he'll be more talkative."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Or I moved you too close to an edge or something.

Wonderful Cowboy Land: It says on the outside that it is a whiskey produced by the Doge Distillery Est. 1832.
Opening the bottle and taking a sniff determines that to be a lie. The booze inside whiffs of expense and age.
Probably brandy, you'd have to taste it to be sure.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "..."
Cassie-May O'Brien took a swig and rolled the liquid in her mouth, but didn't swallow

Wonderful Cowboy Land: Nephi, a rock sails right past your head.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "!"
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Brandy. Weird one."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano jumps up and starts waving his rifle around in confusion
Alexander Hauswald: (Always Sunny card: "Nephi gets caught in a trap")
"...Must be gene-"
Alexander Hauswald saw Nephi and the rock.
Cassie-May O'Brien closes the bottle back and hides it in one of her pockets
Alexander Hauswald: "...Oh boy."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Who's there? Show yerself!"
Wonderful Cowboy Land: "Can't help that you be blind, boy." Drawls a voice from across the river.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks across the little river.
Lyoop is perched on a rock, barefoot. The Indian has a small stack of stones next to him.
Alexander Hauswald takes a step closer.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Welp. Howdy."

Alexander Hauswald: "...Lyoop?"
"Horn sent me."
Lyoop picks up a stone with his right hand and tosses it up in the air a few times.
Lyoop: "Mmmm..."
Lyoop skips it across the river. It lands somewhere around Alex's feet.
Lyoop: "You look it."
Alexander Hauswald tries to not flinch.
Alexander Hauswald: "I look like I make bad decisions?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Hey there, compadre."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "Eeeeyup."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "And he's right, Alex."
"You do."
"The beard, for instance."
Alexander Hauswald: "Fair enough."
Alexander Hauswald looks at Nephi.
Lyoop says nothing in response to Alex or Nephi. He does pick up another stone.
Alexander Hauswald: "Grow one of your own and then talk to me about beards."
Cassie-May O'Brien put her thumbs in her pockets.
Lyoop: "Going to sit on other side of river?"

Alexander Hauswald snickers.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano hops up on top of the log and walks over.
Alexander Hauswald: "It's a good pasttime."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "You both are TERRIBLE friends."
Lyoop skips the stone in his hand downstream. It bounces on the water five times, then blips down under
the current.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano does a little spin as he jumps back on the ground.
Sacks sniffs everything. He was a city dog. Trees smell funny.
Lyoop tosses a stone underhanded. It lands on top of Nephi's hat.
Lyoop: (be back inna tick)
Alexander Hauswald: "...So, Lyoop."

Cassie-May O'Brien steps off the log to give the two space to cross
Crystal Saint Claire: "Finding you was hard."
Alexander Hauswald: "...Sorry to hear."
Alexander Hauswald pauses. Something dawns on him.
Alexander Hauswald: "Crystal."
"You said a while ago you were interested in learning about huckstering?"
Rockett Rimjob: "...Ah can drink whiskey 'til tha sun comes up. Rum treats me well, an' even tequila of all things

"But... fuckin' vodka..." she mutters as she walks by.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Yew need a coffee?"

Rockett Rimjob: "If it's watered down."

Rockett Rimjob: "Ah'm sober, Alex. Ah jus' got a hell of a hangover."
Alexander Hauswald: "I need water and I'll sober her up."
Crystal Saint Claire: "I did say that, Hauswald..."
Crystal Saint Claire pulls out her canteen.

"So between me and the book, I think I can teach you some Hexslinging."

"Yes, Cassie."
"I just said. Hoyle hid his lessons and spells in the book."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Lyoop takes all of you on a winding path through the woods. As you get further in, it
feels like you should cross the path you were walking before, but the trees are perpetually unfamiliar. At some
point, moss covered stones start appearing underfoot. It is hard to tell when they start. It is possible to tell that the
stones are getting less moss covered as the path winds on. The woods get darker, and darker. Soon, it is difficult
to see the bright colors in Lyoop's clothes. Then, the Indian pushes through a dense patch of brush and emerges
into sunlight. He motions for the rest of you to follow.

Crystal Saint Claire exhales.
Lyoop: "Big dining hall."
"Sure they can accommodate in there."
Wonderful Cowboy Land: There is a statue sitting in a pool in the middle of the town square.
It looks ancient.
Moss is growing over the base of it.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads over to look at it.
Crystal Saint Claire makes a note to look at it when she's not exhausted.

Crystal Saint Claire: "Five..?"
"Five."
(To Scotty): I'll make up stats in a bit. Know that it is a decent upgrade from a regular double barrel.
Alexander Hauswald: (brb getting coffee)
Gun Runner: The rifles look to be well made, even if they are all the same. A reliable looking lever action with no
apparent model number or maker's mark.
Rockett Rimjob: "Cuando?" she asks the runner, nodding to the gun in her hands.
Gun Runner: "Let me see what you've got to sell man. I'm sure I can cut you a deal."

Hod stays silent as Crystal speaks. The lips of the woman beside him flatten against her face for a

"Eh..."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano: You get one round per two or three actions instead of one round per action.
Cassie-May O'Brien eyeballs through the shelves in search o anything that would catch her eye.

Gun Runner grabs the gun by the handle. He examines the outside for a minute before cracking open the
breach, popping out the shells, and eyeballing the inside. He tests out the catch a few more times, then
leaves it closed.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is starting to get more than a little unnerved.
Gun Runner: "Is good, for you, I will make it eight dollars."
Gun Runner takes Rockett's fifty and her gun. He hands back a five dollar greenback and four one dollar
coins.
Rockett Rimjob takes the money. Then, she holds out one coin back to him.
General Store Owner: The coffee comes in only one size, the big tin. Picking it up and smelling in between the
join of the lid gives you a strong odor that tingles somewhere at the base of your brain. This is the good stuff.
Gun Runner holds his hands up in protest.
Gun Runner: "Senorita."

Rockett Rimjob: "Five an' three makes eight. You gave me four coins."
Rockett Rimjob holds it out.
Gun Runner: Alex, the two you're holding up to look at are quite different. The barrel of the lighter colored tapers
slim, the black one's barrel is larger, and a little stubbier. The action on the black one is harder to work, and the
entire gun feels heavy in your hand. The lighter colored gun's action is single, but it works like a dream. It is a
balanced weight in your hand, not too much, not too little.
"Ah, you see."
Gun Runner takes the coin back.
Gun Runner: "Maybe I was trying to get in on your good side, hey?"

Alexander Hauswald sets the heavy one down, smiling.

"The laughter and the joy."
Hod paws at his ragged garments as his eyes wander across the room. His head turning to look at
something that only he can see.
Hod: "Soon, it will be empty."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Who are yew...?"
Hod: "I am Hod, as I always have been. As I always will be."
Cassie-May O'Brien: "..."
Cassie-May O'Brien stumbled back a step.
Cassie-May O'Brien: "...Ah think... Ah think Ah oughta git some sleep after all."
Cassie-May O'Brien looks mindfucked.
Cassie-May O'Brien just slumped in the corner
Sigyn: "Sleep well, all of you."
"You can meet the others in the morning."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano sits by the fountain and just watches...

Rockett Rimjob: "...y'all got any bread an' mead?"
dimVitrarius: (nini!)
Wonderful Cowboy Land: All of you get situated in your places and turn in for the night. Most in the feasting hall,
others by the fountain. At some point, Sigyn and Hod leave. They do not close the door of the hall. There is no
door to close. Night falls soon, and each of you dreams deep of strange places. Some dream of a cave with three
pillars. Some dream of the feeling of mistletoe. Some dream of a wolf swallowing the moon and the sun.

Thank you all for playing.

Doc (GM): Yup
Yuppie b.: doc
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Are you ready.
To.
Whitney?
Yuppie b.: yes
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Whitney, you've been ahem "praying" in your bedroom since Crystal took off in search
of the others with Rockett. When you come out, you realize it is rather early in the next day. You exit the town and
take a look at the forest for, well, no reason at all. Certainly nothing to do with anything behind the scenes. As you
walk from the town of Moose into the lush forest around it, you come upon a clearing. A brook burbles, leaves
rustle, and there is another sound in the midst of the water that you can't quite pick out.
(To Yuppie b.): You can move and see and junk right?
(From Yuppie b.): yes
Whitney G. Elieen felt groggy...among other things. Best not to think about those other things just yet. No
what she needed to do was to walk. The clearing looked as good as any.
Whitney G. Elieen: The noise though was curious...
Whitney G. Elieen clunked her way forward, towards the babbling brook
Lyoop sits on a boulder on the other side of the brook. He is dressed in old, sun tanned leather, furs, and
feathers. A small pile of stones sits next to him. He watches Whitney as she approaches, picks a stone up,
and skips it across the brook. It comes to rest on top of Whitney's left shoe.
Whitney G. Elieen looks down at the stone that was thrown towards her. Bending downward to pick it up.
Grasping it tight in her hands, she smiles and waves her free one at the native

Lyoop: "You."
"Got look about."
"With the others?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "The others...yes." She says, noticing his broken English. Perhaps this would be a good time
to brush up on her native. She could not speak in tongues, at least not yet, but she did have a gift for them.
"Yes I am with them."
Lyoop gets up with a slow, fluid grace. He steps off the rock and lands on the ground in a crouch. The
sound, if there is any, does not reach Whitney. The leathery skinned man jerks his head behind him.
Lyoop: "Come."
"Show you the way."
Whitney G. Elieen nods her head as the giantess makes her way out towards the log...
Lyoop: Roll nimbleness.

Lyoop: I fucking spit out my drink.

Whitney G. Elieen: Yes

Lyoop: Whitney, you get halfway across the log with not problems. It is then that your weight occurs to the piece
of wood. The log snaps in two and dumps you into the stream of water. It is cold. Your fingers go numb before you
can push yourself up and out of the water. You're pretty sure your nipples are about to shear through your dress
as you crawl up the bank.
Whitney G. Elieen: "A..aaah!!"
Lyoop walks over and holds a hand out to Whitney as she attempts to leave the brook.
Whitney G. Elieen her massive weight snaps the very log in two! Sending the poor woman falling into the
cold water! By the time she is out of there, she is soaking and miserable...
Whitney G. Elieen reaches her hand out...
Whitney G. Elieen: (brb dinner)
Lyoop: (tell me when you get back)
Poage: (Am home)

Lyoop: "Can't leave you in cold, wet clothes."
"Make a detour for you, before we go to where your friends went."
Lyoop pats Whitney's sopping wet shoulder.
(To Poage): Gettin' Whitney to were you guys are at, give me a tick.
(To Poage): *where
(From Crystal Saint Claire): No problem!
(From Crystal Saint Claire): Crystal is still nappin' in a bundle of blankets under a table.
Nevermore is here
Whitney G. Elieen: BLBLB

Nevermore: bllbl
Whitney G. Elieen: "Yes...yes thank you..."
Whitney G. Elieen said, holding her shoulders in her own hands.
Whitney G. Elieen: "M..much appreciated..."
Lyoop: (just a tick)
Lyoop walks towards the dense forest. Once he gets to the edge of it, he turns and looks at Whitney.
Lyoop: "You comin'?"
(From Poage): should there be music playing?
(From Poage): I can't hear anything
Whitney G. Elieen follows right along, making full use of her long stride
Whitney G. Elieen: "R..right behind you..."
Lyoop walks through the woods, following a winding path that seems to turn in on itself several times.
There is no familiar terrain though, every tree looks different than the last. Lyoop takes a hard right after
what feels like hours of walking and emerges into the light. He keeps the branches and brambles parted
for Whitney to pass through.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Hot, muggy air slaps you in the face Whitney. The cold begins to leave you as you
emerge into a place with no greenery, the only break in the dirt and rocks is a blue steaming spring.
Lyoop: "Here."
"Throw clothes onto rock to dry."
"Warm in spring."
"I smoke and wait."
Whitney G. Elieen feels herself led along the long, confusing path. Distracted by the alien terrain as she
contends with her discomfort. Eventually though, after a time, they come across a site most welcome...a
smile tugging at her lips.

Whitney G. Elieen: "God bless. Thank you..."
Lyoop nods, then walks over behind the rocks as he takes a small tin out of a pocket of his leather shirt.
Whitney G. Elieen makes sure he is well outside the limits of her sight before she begins to undress...
Whitney G. Elieen folds her clothing neatly on a pile, leaving her things alongside it before walking into
the warm waters
Wonderful Cowboy Land: A small plume of smoke emerges from behind the rocks. It is difficult to see the gray of
the tobacco smoke against the white steam coming from the spring.
The water is hot, but nor uncomfortably so. It teases the tension out of your body and leaves only a warm
fuzziness behind. It would be easy to spend hours, days, weeks here.
Whitney G. Elieen: Large as she was, she found herself sinking as low as she could go in the warm, comfortable
waters of the spring...how long had it been since she found such respite? Her body relaxed. Her eyes closed. For
once she opted to simply enjoy the moment. A reminder that not all in this world was corrupt and horrific...
Wonderful Cowboy Land: (Can ze spectators see now?)
Crystal Saint Claire: (Ye)
Nevermore: (Yes)
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Laying back in the spring and floating amidst the soft current of water is relaxing.
Worries, stress, and memory seems to drift away with the water. Losing yourself in it is so pleasant. It would be so
easy to...
Lyoop: "Hey."
"HEY."
"You awake over there?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "..y.yes!" She blurts out suddenly. Followed by a great big yawn as she straightens herself
out. Stretching her arms out above her body.
"I am now at least..."
Lyoop: "Need to go soon."
"Best not to fall asleep here."
"Lose time."
Whitney G. Elieen says in a relaxed tone
Whitney G. Elieen: "You are right...yes. One moment..."
Whitney G. Elieen gets herself up
Whitney G. Elieen goes over to her clothes pile
Whitney G. Elieen: "...I am sorry to disturb you but my clothing is still wet..."
"I would ask you if you had another dress but..."
Whitney G. Elieen frowns
Lyoop: "No, should be fine. Warm up on the way."

Whitney G. Elieen: "Right..."
Whitney G. Elieen slowly places the considerably less pleasant clothes back onto her body. Piece after
piece until she was fully clothed and suddenly much more eager to go.
Whitney G. Elieen sighs
Whitney G. Elieen: "Thank you very much."
Lyoop steps out from behind the rock. There are several hand rolled cigarette buts lying on the ground,
and plenty of ashes. How long were you in there?
Whitney G. Elieen: "I appreciate it very much..."
Lyoop: "Welcome."
Whitney G. Elieen: "And I am not very sure."
"Maybe too long"
"I lost track of time..."
Lyoop looks at you with an odd expression for a moment. Then he turns and walks back into the forest,
motioning for Whitney to follow. Why should she go though? Her clothes are still wet, best to stay at the
hotsprings. The old Indian is a fool to leave.
Whitney G. Elieen: "...I am sorry. I do not mean to impose but...do you think I can stay for a little bit longer? My
clothes are still very uncomfortable...I fear I will catch my death if I go now."
"They will dry up soon I am sure."
Lyoop walks back into the clearing and grabs Whitney by the arm. His face is flat and serious.
Lyoop: "Leave, now."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Is..is something wrong?" She says as she is grabbed by the arm.
"Please be careful..."
Lyoop: "Been here too long."
"Need to leave."
"Not a place meant to stay."
Whitney G. Elieen: "It won't be forever! Perhaps you could even send some of my friends here to get me? I mean
I don't want to impose on you if you have business...and I know a few of the others would enjoy a soak."
"The poor things must be so tired."
Lyoop looks at Whitney for a long few seconds. Then he physically drags her back into the forest with
him. Whitney can feel something poking into her arm as he does.
Whitney G. Elieen: "O..ow!"
Lyoop: Do you resist Whitney?
Whitney G. Elieen drags her arm back as she follows along
Whitney G. Elieen: she does inspect her arm after that

Lyoop lets of her once they are both back into the forest. The opening in the brush where the Spring was
is nowhere to be seen. It is too dark to see, but running your fingers over your arm tells you that your
shirt is torn in five places. You can feel something warm in those spots.
Lyoop: "Time to go."
"Friends waiting."
(From Crystal Saint Claire): Is Lyoop a werewolf? That's dope as hell
Whitney G. Elieen: "..."
(To Poage): He might be.
(To Poage): Or he might be something else.
Whitney G. Elieen looks at her arms more closely. Feeling at the warm spots of her now torn up shirt. Was
that from falling into the brook, or...
Whitney G. Elieen: "Why are you so eager to go? What is it that you are afraid of...?"
Lyoop: "Not good to stay here."
"At the spring."
"Or here."
"In between."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Why? What is wrong?"
Whitney G. Elieen asks as she runs her hands down her arm
Whitney G. Elieen: "What was that poking into my arm?"
Lyoop: "Must have been my fingernails."
"Get long."
"Living out in wild."
Lyoop starts walking further into the forest again. He checks back every few steps to make sure Whitney
is there.
Whitney G. Elieen follows along close behind him. Uncertain of what is going on or even the intentions of
this stranger...this was in God's hands now. Surely she would deliver her through whatever danger this
place posed.
Whitney G. Elieen: "Right..."
Lyoop continues through the forest with Whitney behind him. He moves swift through the foliage. He
brushes his right hand against his shirt a few times. Small stones begin to appear underfoot. Is he,
brushing his lips with his right hand? The stones develop into something resembling a path, they are
covered in moss. Lyoop steps through the brush into the light again. He holds the hole open for Whitney.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Whitney, you emerge into a green place. There are houses in the distance, and a
fountain with a statue standing in it.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is snoozing lightly next to the fountain
Wonderful Cowboy Land: Nephi, you have been next to the fountain all night. You ate some of your rations and
drank from the water.

Crystal, you are waking up from a nap to discover more people in the feasting hall.
Crystal Saint Claire is asleep, snuggled up in a blanket on a haybale. She only needed one hay bale to
sleep on.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: It is a bedroll and a pillow.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano hasn't moved for hours.
Crystal Saint Claire: "mrrh... G'mornin'..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has his rifle in as tight of a grip as his dozing self can manage
Crystal Saint Claire blearily wipes sleep from her eyes.
Whitney G. Elieen: (One momentO)
Sigyn: "Morning little one."
"Your friends are still asleep, try not to wake them."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Oh! Good morning Miss Sigyn..."
Sigyn: "I asked the others to be quiet as they could."
Crystal Saint Claire whispers to her.
Crystal Saint Claire: "I will try to avoid waking them."
"Do you know where I could find something to eat?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "...thank you very much." She says, looking at the sleepy little town with a curious raise of her
brow. Turning to him with a smile and a bow of her head.
"God bless you for your hospitality and your guidance."
Sigyn: "Of course, we've got the meat for today spitted and roasting."
"I'll carve you some."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Thank you..."
Lyoop bows to Whitney. then walks back into the forest.
Lyoop: "Be waiting for when you want to come back."
"Be safe."
Crystal Saint Claire walks over to the roasting boar.
Crystal Saint Claire sleepily stretches, yawning a squeaky yawn, and turns to see if the sun is up yet.
Sigyn picks up the sword laying next to the fire pit and slices off a leg for Crystal.
Whitney G. Elieen steps forward, step after heavy step...
Sigyn: "Hod, mead and a plate?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "That is a lot of meat... I am unsure I will finish it all."

Hod wordlessly takes a mug of mead from under the flowing spigot and holds out a plate to Sigyn. The
woman slaps the leg onto, takes the plate and the mead, then gives it to Crystal.
Sigyn: "Here."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Thank you. May I eat outside?"
Sigyn: "You may eat wherever you wish."
Crystal Saint Claire: "It is a beautiful morning."
Sigyn: "Only, bring back the dishes..."
Crystal Saint Claire: "Yes ma'am!"
Sigyn peters off as Crystal runs outside.
Crystal Saint Claire peeks back through the door. "To you, or to Mr. Hod? Where do the dishes go?"
Crystal Saint Claire: "I apologize, I ran off..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Mmnmh.":
Sigyn: "Just leave them by the mead casks."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano lifts his hat up
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Whitney?"
"Oh good gracious, Whitney!"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano jumps up and, without even really realizing what he was doing, hugs her
Sigyn leans against the stones of the fire pit.
Hod rubs at his filmy eyes with a distracted hand.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Yes ma'am!"
Crystal Saint Claire toddles off
Whitney G. Elieen: "Yes! Yes so good to see you again..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Whitney we gotta get outta here."
Crystal Saint Claire sets her lunch down next to the fountain. She's still a bit groggy, and half-blind, so
she doesn't notice Whitney... until she speaks.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Whitney!!"
Whitney G. Elieen smiles at him...and her smile grows all the wider as Crystal walks into the scene!
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Something really weird's going on around-"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is still hugging

Whitney G. Elieen engulfs Crystal in a hug. Picking the much smaller woman up
Crystal Saint Claire hugs Whitney as tight as she can. Which... still isn't very tight.
Whitney G. Elieen: "God be praised that I may see you again!"
Whitney G. Elieen says as she sets Crystal down
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Er."
"When y'all two are finished."
Whitney G. Elieen: "How worried I was...sorry. I may have come sooner had it not been for falling into the river."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "There's funny business goin on around here."
Whitney G. Elieen turns her head over to Nephi
Crystal Saint Claire is still hugging onto Whitney's leg.
Whitney G. Elieen: "Now what mean you by "Funny business" She says, still holding Crystal close to herself
Crystal Saint Claire: She's sort of babbling half to herself, half to Whitney the whole time.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Somethin real WEIRD. This place is wrong."
"Cassie knew more, but I think she's..."
Crystal Saint Claire: "We went through the woods and it was dark and scary and I almost got lost and Lyoop has
a nice name and Miss Sigyn gave me some food and a place to sleep but it's meat so you can't eat it but I bet they

Wow the dice are cursed today.
Wonderful Cowboy Land: You take Whitney's left arm and examine it. There are five neat puncture wounds
there. Each one is leaking a little blood, but not much. You should get these disinfected and put a bandage on.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Does anyone have some alcohol? Something stronger than mead would be preferable...
Or... garlic, garlic might make a suitible antiseptic..."
Crystal Saint Claire attempts to lead Whitney to the dining hall.
Whitney G. Elieen: "...I do. If cider can be counted as such..."
Crystal Saint Claire takes her cup of mead.
Crystal Saint Claire: "Cider is insufficient. Something like whiskey."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Follow us nephi. There is much we must discuss of this place"

"Perhaps more."
"He has gone on most trips to find dear friends of ours who have fallen to the ill will of others."
Whitney G. Elieen: "...I see. Quests of discovery and recovery...he sounds like a noble soul."
"Only God might know where he is at this point. And she never tells easily...he is in my prayers. Wherever he
might be. As you are all in mine."
"This place is...I can't quite put my finger on it...there is a peace here, though maybe it is my time in the spring that
makes me say so."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is still standing by the wall. Quietly listening in.
Sigyn: "We try to keep this place as it has always been."
"Peaceful, and sublime."
"A place to rest and recover."
Whitney G. Elieen: "And so it has been." She says with a smile. "Though speaking of rest...I feel I must sit for a
time."
"Perhaps enjoy this apple you have kindly offered to me."
Sigyn: "Go ahead."
"Enjoy our hospitality, as we enjoy having you."
Whitney G. Elieen bows her head and smiles
Whitney G. Elieen: "Thank you...and God bless."
Whitney G. Elieen walks towards Nephi, with Crystal in tow
Whitney G. Elieen: "Shall we dine outside then?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Yeah."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks at every one of the fellows he could see and, ultimately, doesn't see
anything worth starting a fuss over.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Nice day for a picnic anyways."
Sigyn: "Of course."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has to step around Whitney, unable to get to the door because of her prodicious
size.
Hod: "Come back if you need anything."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads out to the fountain, and turns to Whitney.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "So."
Whitney G. Elieen nods once before walking out.
Whitney G. Elieen: "...yes Nephi?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...You're not feeling bothered?"
"Everything here's... Too nice."
"Way too nice."

"Even the nice bits of Salt Lake ain't like this."
Whitney G. Elieen clenches her injured arm
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "S'just..."
Whitney G. Elieen: "The strangeness is not lost on me, I assure you."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Am I insane for thinkin it's all just wrong somehow?"
"Any normal folk come here they'd probably be goin on about how wonderful everyone is."
"...I just get scared."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano slumps down by the fountain's base.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has a bite from some bread from his rations.
Whitney G. Elieen: "My experience in the woods has me worried as well...but I trust you are basing this off more
than just a strange feeling?"
Whitney G. Elieen said as she takes a bite of her apple
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "What Cassie said."
"This place shouldn't be here."
"Especially this statue because it used to be on the east coast or somethin like that."
"There's some kinda powerful mojo goin on around here."
"Alex'd probably know more but he's been practicin his devil magic or whatever he does for a while now."
"Look at that statue, Whitney."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Looks like it's been here bout a hunderd years, yeah?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "...hmmm...I may talk with Alex myself soon enough."
Whitney G. Elieen looks to the statue
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Either this place is older than the Union or there's somethin mighty strange goin
down."
Whitney G. Elieen: "These lands have been here far longer then any kingdom of man..."
"...who is to say what is true or not? The native who led me here..."
"Are you familar with him?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Whitney. We're in what was once Indian lands."
"Ain't no way something like this could be here."
"Which is why it bothers me that it is so much."
Whitney G. Elieen: "The native?"
Whitney G. Elieen says with another bite of her apple
Whitney G. Elieen: "Did you know him?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "No."
Whitney G. Elieen: "The one with the long finger nails."

"...hmmm."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Someone told Alex about him.?
"
Whitney G. Elieen: "Who told Alex about him?"
"What did he have to say?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "I think it's whatever dark power Alex dealt with."
"He's in debt to the same thing Alex is."
Whitney G. Elieen nods her head."
Whitney G. Elieen: "...I see."
"I will need to speak with Alex...and the demon."
"Soon."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "I don't think any demon would exactly be willin to talk to a man o'god... Or, eh,
woman, as the case may be."
Whitney G. Elieen: "If there is one thing demons love to do."
"It is to talk"
"Besides. We have met before remember?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "And to try to lead us astray, yeah."
"...Yeah."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano nibbles on more bread.
Whitney G. Elieen sighs before taking a bite of her apple
Whitney G. Elieen: "The native said if i wished to return to the spring that he would be back..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...I'm here for ya, Whitney. If you need my gun or another man of faith, y'know?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "I will await his arrival again." She said, smiling softly at him.
"And thank you very much Nephi."
"This has been a...trying time for me. For us all..."
"But through God we can find strength."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Heh. Where's all the Son of Joseph business you usually go with~?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "Even in the face of darkness."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano offers her an unbitten slice of bread
Whitney G. Elieen takes it with a smile. "It has been a long journey here...and besides. Son of Joseph or
not...we are all children of God."
Whitney G. Elieen: "Your teacher is not my teacher but the gift is universal."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "We sure are."

Whitney G. Elieen bites into it.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Aw, shucks, I ain't never had the gift."
"I've seen what the prophets and the Twelve can do."
"Nobody in my family's got it."
"Cept maybe my ma."
"They say every man with the priesthood can call down the power of the angels, but... Only a few of em can do it
on the regular, y'know?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "We are all offered salvation, and so we all have the gift. That is the grandest miracle of
all...all else springs from the same fountain."
"It is hard to say why God does what she does...and selects who she does. But there is power to the word and to
faith. A real power...for the longest time only the greats of ancient times could be said to do what I can also do."
Whitney G. Elieen says as she produces her holy mug
Whitney G. Elieen drains the top a little before sipping
Whitney G. Elieen: "I take it a sign that the second coming approaches...soon."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Miracles..."
"...Yer an adventist, right?"
Whitney G. Elieen hands the mug over to him
Whitney G. Elieen: "Yes."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano takes a little sip.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Didn't they have that whole kerfuffle a while back?"
Whitney G. Elieen: "Are you refering to the great dissapointment?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Yeah."
"...Mostly I remember my bishop laughin bout it. Seemed kinda mean."
"He wasn't the nicest fella. Er, not to talk bad bout the lord's servants."
Whitney G. Elieen: "That is correct, yes. Miller falsly believed in his divine mathmatics. Our family was hit hard by
this...but from disappointment and failure can come greater faith and understanding"
"and it is fine"
"My father was not all that nice either."
Whitney G. Elieen said with another sigh. "For a man of God that is."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Yeah. I remember hearin bout that. My condolences."
"But hey, we ever end up in Junkyard, yer comin for dinner."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano says matter-of-factly.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "My folks love meetin my friends, after all."
"Ma's cookin is to diiie for, mmh."
Whitney G. Elieen smiles yet again after a brief moment of melencholic silence.

Whitney G. Elieen: "I would like this very much Nephi."
"I always enjoyed meeting others."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Alma and Lehi would love to meet you too."
"I just hope Helaman hasn't come back home."
"...He's more Rockett's speed."
"If you understand what I'm saying."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano frowns.
Whitney G. Elieen: "I see..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...Whitney, if it's any consolation, I'm sorry bout yer home life. It's a darn shame when
a kid doesn't have a good time with their folks.":
Nephi "Longiron" Delano gives Whitney her water back.
Whitney G. Elieen: It was not water, but cider! Cold and crisp it seemed from the small sip you took.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: Ooh.
Whitney G. Elieen: "It was just the one. The great disappointment turned him cruel and harsh. He blamed himself
and his family for his perceived damnation. It has been a long time..." She says in a distant tone. "They are in
heaven now. All but two of us. My mission calls me to rise above the scars of the past."
"To heal others and lead them above. That is my mission. Wounds of the past will remain there and will eventually
be wiped clean by the grace of God."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Well, you've been doing a good job of it so far."
Whitney G. Elieen: "It is not enough. I pray God will grant me the power to do more soon. To fend off evil and to
heal the sick. Of body and mind."
"All you have seen comes from her. And it is only the begining."
Whitney G. Elieen sighs again as she takes a bite of her apple
Whitney G. Elieen: "I just hope to be a worthy vessle. Now especially as we face darker powers..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Yeah."
"Haven't really started tusslin with the real bad ones just yet."
"They're out there, though. I seen one of them."
Whitney G. Elieen: "One of them?"
"Who did you see?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "I call him the Ivory Rider."
"..."
"He... Probably killed all mah friends."
Whitney G. Elieen: "..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano falls quiet, and dark.
Whitney G. Elieen goes stiff...ridged

Whitney G. Elieen: "Tall? White?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano grips his rifle tight enough for his hand to go pale and start leaving a mark in the
wood
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "That's the one."
"I'm not common to all these stories of vampires and whorewolves and gribbly-gnawies."
"...But he's probably The Adversary's right-hand man."
"I told you bout my... Old friends, right?"
"Used to have another posse I traveled with."
Whitney G. Elieen: "...you mentioned them before I believe..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "One was a doctor from engaland. A priest from some parts of the east of Europe.
Some two-bit drifter, a union soldier, and..."
"Heh. "Mister Alexander Hardin, No Relation". Always made me laugh a bit when he said that."
"We were all lookin for a treasure buried out in Kansas when it... Happened."
"He showed up. Everything went dark. I heard screams."
"I ran for my life."
"Ran and ran the whole night through."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "...When the mornin came around, I found my way back to the campsite."
"...Blood on the ground."
"Everyone, and the map, was gone."
"Never found no bodies."
Whitney G. Elieen: "..."
"It seems wherever he goes...he brings horror in his wake..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "If anyone survived, it was probably Hardin."
"Old man took a shotgun blast to the chest and walked it off the next day."
"...But he showed up again, just before we left Dodge."
"I mentioned it."
"He carved somethin into my pop's rifle too."
Whitney G. Elieen: "...what did he carve?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano moves his hand, showing it
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: (Can't remember at the moment, help me out Doc)
Wonderful Cowboy Land: "Et In Arcadia..."
(Also none of y'all can remember a lot of stuff, but I wasn't gonna say nothin'.)
Whitney G. Elieen: "...hmmmm..."
"I see..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano: (It was before christmas man cut me some slack)

Nephi "Longiron" Delano: "Yeah..."
Whitney G. Elieen: "I am sorry you had to endure such an insult..."
