THIS HEIGHT WAS PASSED DOWN THE ARMSTRONG FAMILY LINE FOR GENERATIONS.Doc (GM):
Reginald Percival Grenfell FLEXES.

Whitney G. Elieen PRAYS
"Incredible valor."Reginald Percival Grenfell:
"RESPECTABLE MUSCLES."
"Unshakeable faith"Whitney G. Elieen:
"GOD IS MY ROCK"
Reginald Percival Grenfell extends a hand to Whitney and bends down to one knee in one motion.
"Miss Whitney."Reginald Percival Grenfell:
"Would you make me the most happy man that has ever walked these dust covered lands?"
"Oh Sir Reginald..." She says with a smile as she pulls him up to his feet. Perhaps one of few
who can actually do such a thing.
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Walk with me and become the happiest man to have lived. Both on the dusty roads of earth and the golden
streets of the city eternal."
Reginald Percival Grenfell swoons with a whole lot of ham. He manages to take out two ceiling lights and
leave a good dent in a side of the train.
"Oh this is wonderful."Reginald Percival Grenfell:
"Splendid."
"Our children will have faith and joy passed down their line FOR GENERATIONS!"

Whitney G. Elieen:
"REJOICE FOR GOD IS GOOD"
Reginald Percival Grenfell grabs Whitney and lifts her up as tears of joy run down his chiseled jawline.
"...Ah really need ta quit drinkin'."Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
Whitney G. Elieen swoons like a southern girl in the spiritual heat of an awakening. Taking out the entire
side of the train in the process of doing so.

https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 4/791
Nevermore is also going to update my sheet.
even more ammo, a saber, speedloaders, more knives, loads of spare clothes, (assless)
chaps, duster, boots, actually paid for my Stetson, minor things
Cassie-May O'Brien:
That's a good idea actuallyYuppie b.:
I need to buy some spare clothing
Yuppie b. almost forgot her Saturday dress
We'll be in town for a little bit.Nevermore:
It'll be the perfect time
Right.
Good goodYuppie b.:
Well, in a second, I think the train's gonna be making a stop and we'll gain our next
passenger.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
~!Poage:
Success~!
Alrighty.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Your sheet all up to standards, Alexander?
There's two of me.Alexander Hauswald:
I ma have been a tad overzealous.Poage:
We'll delete whichever one is less complete.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Aaaalright.Alexander Hauswald:
Then yes. I'm done.
Now we're going to introduce you!Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
...
Ssssoooooooooooooooooooon.
I... think Doc should have a hand in this and he isPoage:
I think I'm done updatin' my sheetCassie-May O'Brien:
he is busyPoage:
very busy
right now
He's probably reading the 2000 page reading assignment he just got.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Somethinglike that, yes.Poage:
Wait, is this a school thing or something else
Because he implied it was not game related, but ofactual importance.
1/20/2018 Chat Log for Wonderful Cowboy Adventure Land
https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 5/791
It is in fact school related. He will get to us when he has time. There are other things he also has to do
ontop of that.
Yuppie b.:
I'm starting to think thatCassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie is some sort of a bootleg Kiddo
crazy prepared
Likewise I feel Whitney is a sort of bastardize cross between Frozen and Karabou and Pill.Yuppie b.:
Large and hardy, Faithful and gentle, and maybe a little unsettled.
I have no idea who Alexander is supposed to beAlexander Hauswald:
I already HAVE a gun-wizard OC and they're nothing alike
Crystal is literally Crystal.Poage:
Brb
Frozen and Pill are actually other people's characters. Frozen in particular is Varmus's who is currently
in a relationship with my tortured war criminal deer. Pill is a "Stock priest character" and you of course know who
Kara is.
Yuppie b.:
Frozen is a nearly unkillable, masculine lumberjack.Cassie-May O'Brien:
Nearly unkillable as in really clings to life absurdly hard.
Not invincible, despite my best efforts.
I rememberAlexander Hauswald:
Most people don't fucking survive something called "shotgun abortion"
PfftCassie-May O'Brien:
old news
she forgave the mare that shot her
hug and all
She has grown quite a bit from that time.Yuppie b.:
she also has been shot through with a literal cannon like three times so farCassie-May O'Brien:
damaged so badly that she's literally on Dark Magic life support now
It certainly was a process from killing our baby to forgiveness.Yuppie b.:
Will putting her in a 40k-style dreadnaught be a downgrade?Alexander Hauswald:
To top it off she is in love with a sometimes promiscuous deer who at times keeps secrets and is
almost as tortured as her. Mentally at least.
Yuppie b.:
She is also one hundred times more masculine than said deer.
ActuallyCassie-May O'Brien:
she already was in something like that
literal power armor.
No, specifically a dreadnaughtAlexander Hauswald:

then those disappeared after they timetravelled because an ancient time golem told them to
do so or he deletes reality.
Cassie-May O'Brien:
An armored coffin powered solely by her rageAlexander Hauswald:
There is no rage left in Frozen HorizonCassie-May O'Brien:
just exhaustion, disappointment, confusion and feeling of utter powerlessness.
I am backPoage:
Welcome back!Whitney G. Elieen:
So what do you think the odds are we meet Bani Karl, Fastest Knife in the West during a one-off?Poage:
And he's still a penguin
he jsut wears a cowboy hat, and nobody questions it.
Except for the Ranger.
Crystal just assumes he's from Pittsburgh
"The all have that accent!"Crystal Saint Claire:
Also, Nev, you here?
I need some help wit a number or two, and some gear..
Eh?Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Oh
Ehh.
Got the numbers fixedCrystal Saint Claire:
But I need gear help
I have all this money
Why do you have all this moneyNephi "Longiron" Delano:
500 dollars starting equipmentCrystal Saint Claire:
...Why do you have that muchNephi "Longiron" Delano:
I took 2-point DineroCrystal Saint Claire:
Rich kidAlexander Hauswald:
Crystal has a rich uncleCrystal Saint Claire:

A rich uncle who got too touchy-feely?

Also, Alexander named his horse Clip.
Because it makes a Clip Clop noise.
Maybe it isn't the dog that's dumb, just Alexander that's bad at names.Varulv:
Whitney's horse shall be namedWhitney G. Elieen:

Because it's a mare with an ass like a stallion?Crystal Saint Claire:

Well, we're on a train right now...Crystal Saint Claire:
I'm asking because it's 2 AM hereAlexander Hauswald:
So you could be somewhere on the train. We haven't explored it much... Ask doc if he has
preferences on how you're introduced, maybe?
Crystal Saint Claire:
Ah wouldn' mind meetin' up another pardnah in this lil' endeavour.Cassie-May O'Brien:
Yeah, tha'd do it.Crystal Saint Claire:
Oh, man
Game time is gonna be fun for you.
As long as it's on weekends, I'll survive.Alexander Hauswald:
We should scheduleCrystal Saint Claire:
because I literally cannot friday, saturday, Sunday.
Work, Work, TFN
Most likely scenario
LikeAlexander Hauswald:
Right now is the best
Oh.Crystal Saint Claire:
I could work this.
On this day.
sameCassie-May O'Brien:
Same.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
We'd miss Varulv, tho.
Yeah...Crystal Saint Claire:
He went to bed, didn't he.
Who, Var?Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
He did.Crystal Saint Claire:
Varulv.
Went to sleep.
YeahNephi "Longiron" Delano:

So.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
What if we start like
He'd pass out an hour and a half inCrystal Saint Claire:
Threeee hours agoNephi "Longiron" Delano:
I could do that. Unsure about anyone elseCrystal Saint Claire:
And also Doc is a person
I can do that.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
This is true.
I'd do that tooAlexander Hauswald:
I could do that myselfWhitney G. Elieen:
Sooooo, we're set then?Alexander Hauswald:
Hell no, we have to get Varulv, Doc, Varmus...Crystal Saint Claire:
I think just them.
Oh and Moondew
So I think
If Crystal was using a shotgun
It would be...
But I am unsure.Crystal Saint Claire:

Anyhoo, can I sleep?Alexander Hauswald:
You may, if you wish.Crystal Saint Claire:
You don't need my permission.
I mean, I'm curious because you might need me around.Alexander Hauswald:
Did you ask Doc if he had anything planned for your introduction?Crystal Saint Claire:
If he doesn't then we could probably write you in on the spot, no?
But if he does then I don't wanna step on that.
So we are probably not the ones to talk to about whether you're gonna be needed or not.
Well, Doc isn't around.Alexander Hauswald:
Right.Crystal Saint Claire:
So I guess you can sleep.0000

I'm usually not a dickhead if it can be helped.Doc (GM):
Unless it's Nev.
And he knows I'm joking.

So, are we planning on anyting tonight?

...Hello ladies.
Crystal Saint Claire is hiding behind Whitney after all that
Crystal ends up hiding in the gigantic dress that Whitney wore.Whitney G. Elieen:
...
(Also I need to get to bed! If need be, assume Whitney is taking a little snooze)
I like to imagine Crystal can wear Whitney's shirt as a dress.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
This is accurateCrystal Saint Claire:
This is almost a certainty.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is leaning against the door of the train, canteen in hand, looking out over the
miles of countryside rolling by.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks out into the distance, almost like he can see something out there. His gaze
narrows, as if whatever he's looking at is there, taunting him. He frowns.
Crystal Saint Claire hesitantly approaches.
"...what are you looking at?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"...Countryside."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Wondering how far we are from Utah right now."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano takes a sip from his canteen
"...You holding up? I'm sorry if I scared you earlier."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Roughly one-thousand and ten miles."
"...Well, I got no idea how to check anyways, so I'll take your word for it."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...You remind me a lot of my younger sisters, you know."
"You mentioned this."Crystal Saint Claire:
"They got all the brains in the family anyhow."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Crystal Saint Claire is digging through the carpet bag she carries everywhere.
"I got all the brains. Got everything. Only child."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Sorry to hear that."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"It did not make much difference."Crystal Saint Claire:
"It does, though."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I am glad I had no siblings."Crystal Saint Claire:
"You never have to fight for nothin. Don't gotta battle for scraps at the family table."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"They would have had to meet my parents."Crystal Saint Claire:
"I was never real good at that. Heh, you wonder how I got to be so darn skinny?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...never had to fight?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"I'd squabble with my siblins all the time."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Crystal Saint Claire is suddenly looking at you. Not quite sad, closer to angry.
"Who gets the last piece of bacon, who gets what toy, who gets to go shootin with
ma."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Y'gotta have siblings to know it like that."
"I suppose."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Well, you don't gotta worry. Between myself and the rest of the cowpokes on this
train, we got enough firepower here to hold of darn near anythin."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Competition without consequence."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Ain't nothin to be afriad of here."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano kneels down to be on Crystal's level.
"You ever need anythin or anyone's hurtin you, you hollar and I'll come help, alright?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Crystal Saint Claire is rummaging through the bag, but freezes as Nephi comes down to her level.
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano resists the urge to give her a friendly pat on the head, and returns to looking out
of the window.
"Please step away"Crystal Saint Claire:
"..."
"Awright. As you like it."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...thank you"Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire relaxes.
"You remind me... of my uncle."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Heh, really?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"He the good kind?"
"Yes."Crystal Saint Claire:
"He is why I am not dead."
"I'm actually an uncle now myself. Oldest brother had his first baby not long before I
left."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"That is good."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Got back from his mission and had his girl arm in arm."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Real wild child from Mexico."
"Had tattoos and everything. But she joined the church, and if it's good enough for ma and pa, it's good enough for
me."
"I hope she is happy now."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Yeah. Can't help but wonder how they're all doin. Probably gonna send a wire home
when we get to Kansas City."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I will contact my uncle."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Perhaps Professor Cecil."
"Professor Cecil... He the one who trained you Back East?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Yes."Crystal Saint Claire:
"He is a professor of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."

"The contest. The one you have going with Ranger Mathers."
"I have a request, if you would be willing to hear it..."
"...Yeah?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Crystal Saint Claire pulls out a strange-looking revolver from the carpetbag. It looks unused, and there are
strange runes stamped shallowly into the surface.
"Would you be willing to use this?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Whoa!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano nearly jumps out of his skin at the girl drawing a revolver on him
"C-careful with that, guns ain't a toy, y'know!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Crystal Saint Claire is pointing it at the ground, holding it by the barrel.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano realizes this after a second
"..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I am aware. I am trained in safety procedures concerning these sorts of things."Crystal Saint Claire:
"I ain't really a good pistol shot, unfortunately."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Ma only taught me how to use rifles."
"How are you with shotguns?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"And dad showed me how to shoot the newfangled automatics."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Don't do well with those either. The kickback near broke my shoulder last time."
"...hm..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Tell you what, you're free to tinker with the guns I got, alright?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Are you sure?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Positive."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"That's a sciencey term, right?"
"Any modifications straying from the factory standards could cause a notable decrease in
the reliability of the firearm..."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"I got another rifle, you know."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Lightning repeater. It's a hand me down, but it's the same one my big brothers used. If it was good enough for
them, it's good enough for me."
"Lever-action, or revolver?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Revolver!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"It's a revolvin rifle."
"Got a slide you pull between shots."
"I could try to alter the mechanism, to make it a little smoother, but any change I can make
has probably already been tried somewhere."

"That's fair. Miss Callie uses pistols, though. If you think she's cotton to tryin it out, be
my guest."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I know I'm gonna win."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano grins wide, brimming with confidence.
"She ain't got a chance, weird science gizmo or no. I'm the best there's ever been."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Well, gonna be, anyways."
"And I know just the way to prove it..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano goes back to looking out the window...
"I'll be ready for you soon..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Does it involve shooting a renowned sniper?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"...Naw."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Somethin..."
"..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has a peculiar look on his face. The kind of look a man gets when his most
trusted friend has just told him his pa just crawled out of the grave.
"...Else."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Don't feel like talkin bout it."
"You seem distressed. I will discontinue this line of conversation."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Ain't your fault. Just thinkin bout what I gotta do."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Have you considered options for close-quarters combat?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"...Don't even know if it was real."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Girly, lookit me."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is quite a bit taller than Crystal, sure, but just as skinny.
"Do I look like the kinda fella that's good in a brawl?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Yes. You are not strong. Hand-to-hand capabilities likely lacking."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Well ya don't gotta put it like that!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"What you have to be so mean for..."
"That is why any brawler with an ounce of sense will target you first."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Hey, think you can ah..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"If they get too close for the rifle to be reliable..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Come up with sometin like the rebs have?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"With the pistol that has a shotgun too?"
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire pulls the pistol slightly further from the carpetbag, revealing the shotgun attachment.
"...Niiice."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Think you could fit one on my rifle?"
"That'd be a way better surprise than some bayonet."
"...I am currently attempting to prototype something to that effect."Crystal Saint Claire:
"It would be odd, and similar to tying a shotgun to your rifle."
"The reason it works with the pistol is that a shotgun and a pisto, are about the same size, mechanism-wise."
"Perhaps the way to do it would be to use the same hammer mechanism... And simply place a full shotgun barrel
beneath the rifle's barrel?"
"It would likely need to be made of ghost steel."
"Otherwise it would become prohibitively heavy."
"Unless a sawed-off length barrel was used."Crystal Saint Claire:
"But then one would have to use a separate trigger mechanism for the shotgun, adding more maintainence and
potential for error."
Crystal Saint Claire rummages through her bag for paper and writing stuff.

"I do not follow."
"Like"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Just make the trigger for the shotgun like..."
"Like a rod you pull."
"Perhaps if there was a safety to disengage first..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Attach it to the side of the body"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Then you pull it when somethin uppity gets too close."
"Maybe like"
"Twist it first?"
"If there is not a safety, shifting one's grip on the firearm might cause premature gunfire..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"One moment."
"...Yeah you work on that."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I'll be here. Wouldn't be the first time I was used as a guinea pig."
"Ishmael would mix elixirs into my morning juice."

"You would have to push forward, twist counter-clockwise, and then pull back, firing the
shotgun.
Crystal Saint Claire:
"
"...Maybe it'll make sense when I'm lookin at it."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I am unsure how to create a foolproof safety..."Crystal Saint Claire:
".."
"You'll figure it out. Ah got faith."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Okay. So..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"If you were pointing the gun forward
There would be a grip of some sort."
"Which hand do you not pull the trigger with?"
"And we still got a ways to travel, so you figure it...."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I'm a lefty. So my right."
"Your right hand would be supporting the gun."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Yep."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"And where it usually lies, there could be some sort of grip.Crystal Saint Claire:
"
"You push the grip forward until you hear a click, then turn left until you hear another click, then push forward to
fire."
"No wait you pull back to fire."
"It would take practice to make the motion smooth..."
"But it would be kind of a..."
Crystal Saint Claire mimes the action.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano stands there, listening to Crystal ramble with a faint smile, occasionally
muttering a "Mmhmm"
Crystal Saint Claire looks like she's giving someone at her shoulder height a handjob REALLY SLOWLY.
"..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Like this?"Crystal Saint Claire:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has no idea what that is either.
"Yeah, actually, looks pretty good."{Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano says with utmost sincerity.
"...Somethin..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Somethin seems weird about it, though. Can't quite put my finger on it."

"Keep workin on it. You'll get it.":Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"When it comes time to build it, you let me know. I learned a thing or two from watchin Ish' work."

I just remembered what you can spend your cash on.
A better lab setup.

Due to an unfortunate coincidence
Crystal is going to be terrified of Reginald for a not-insignificant time.
Silly Irish superstition, I'm sure!Varulv:
Nah. Sheer trauma.Poage:
Irish. Superstition.Varulv:
Remind me to link you her backstory later~!Poage:
Why not just put it in the public section of the sheet? =PVarulv:
Like how Reginald's is.
Well, how much of his backstory would Reginald bring up? OR talk about if asked?Poage:
All of it.Varulv:
At least as far as he's aware himself.
There are pieces of Crystal's backstory she doesn't remember, and pieces she will not talk about.Poage:
Because I drew BOTH DAMN JOKERS

S'just so much harder to keep track of who I've told wht to.
Anywho
Take a read!
Crystal Saint Claire has a backstory
AnywhoCrystal Saint Claire:
Ooohboy.Varulv:
Someone getting a punchin' if they ever come around.
Train is chugga chugga chugging alongCrystal Saint Claire:
...pls no punch me
Of course not! A gentleman would never pay a finger on a lady.Reginald Percival Grenfell:
lay*
To my knowledge, he never hit her.Crystal Saint Claire:
There are other things covered by 'laying a finger on' than punching.Reginald Percival Grenfell:
Anyhow....
We could do a late-night stop.Crystal Saint Claire:
All the others are asleep, or something.
That also works.Reginald Percival Grenfell:
Crystal Saint Claire promised to stop staying up late for Whitney but sometimes she gets ideas in the
middle of the night
Crystal Saint Claire is currently in the dining car, the only place with big enough tables to contain her
work.
Reginald Percival Grenfell was one of the newest arrivals on the train, having gotten on-board at its latest
stop. In fact, he had only just gotten on to the train and found his own compartment, before deciding that
a little night time-drink was the perfect way to round off the day. As he stepped into the dining car, three
things made him stand out from likely anyone else on board: his clothing was near sparkling clean, hardly
a fold to be seen. Not in the coat - that was clearly of military origin, but did not belong to any American
army - or the perfectly tailored suit he wore underneath. Then was his hat, a bowler that one would be
hard pressed to find anyone else in the States wearing. A walking cane despite not seeming like he
needed such aid. And finally: he was huge. In both good senses of the word. So tall he had to lean
forward slightly to get through the doorway, and enough muscles to likely put even a horse to shame.
Reginald Percival Grenfell pauses for a moment after entering and looks around, a light, non-bothered,
smile on his face. Only noticing Crystal, he removes his hat and casually approaches.
Crystal Saint Claire is tinkering with something on a table, currently rummaging in her carpet bag. She
waves back over her shoulder.
"I know I said I would sleep Whitney but I had a breakthrough"Crystal Saint Claire:
"I promise, just one more hour"
"Forgive my intrusion, madam, but would you happen to know if this establishment
offers nighttime services?" His voice did not at all match the body, seeming more at home with an actor, or singer.
Reginald Percival Grenfell:
1/20/2018 Chat Log for Wonderful Cowboy Adventure Land
https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 22/791
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Reginald Percival Grenfell removes his hat, revealing a mostly bald head.
Crystal Saint Claire freezes the moment she hears the unfamiliar voice.
The sound of a revolver cocking is distinctive, and carries at least across a silent dining hall.Crystal Saint Claire:
Reginald Percival Grenfell raises an eyebrow at the sound, but does not seem bothered by it otherwise.
Crystal Saint Claire turns very slowly, one hand in the carpet bag, the other holding onto the table
The moment she actually sees Reginald, she's off and running.Crystal Saint Claire:
"Apologies if I frightened you, madam." He offers a light bow, hat head against his
chest.
Reginald Percival Grenfell:
Her work is left on the table.Crystal Saint Claire:
"Oh bother."Reginald Percival Grenfell:
"Madam, please, there is no need to fear," he calls after her.
You can hear footsteps going down the train.Crystal Saint Claire:
Well, away from the dining car.
Reginald Percival Grenfell moves to the table, looking over the assorted items strewn about with mild
curiosity and interest. After studying it for a moment while rubbing his chin thoughtfully, he grabs at bag
and stoves everything down into it, then heads off after the running girl in an attempt to catch up with her.
Actually, how old is crystal? In a girl vs woman sense.Varulv:
15.Crystal Saint Claire:
So girl.Varulv:
She is 15 years of age.Crystal Saint Claire:
Yeah.
How careful are you with that? It looks like delicate machinery; clockwork.
Rrrrelatively. Everything goes in the bag, but it's not 'arm on table, brush it all in in
one motion'.
Reginald Percival Grenfell:
Got it.Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire has locked herself in a sleeping car.
How certain would it be that any one of them was hers?Reginald Percival Grenfell:
She didn't lock herself in her room. Just the first one she could find.Crystal Saint Claire:
Would he have seen her enter?Reginald Percival Grenfell:
The train is pretty unoccupied.Crystal Saint Claire:
He would have seen her take a hard left into a room, likely.

Reginald Percival Grenfell carefully knocks on the door. "Apologies for scaring you, miss, and for still
bothering, but you left your belongings on the table, I would like to return them to you."
"If yer don't step back oi'm gonna shoot."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Now, now, I assure there is no need for that. Just let me return your belongings and
I shall be on my way."
Reginald Percival Grenfell:
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Jist put de bag down an' walk away."
The sounds of furniture moving are evident from the other side of the door.
"If you are certain, miss, but this is not like back home. The gents of these lands do
not have the tact to simply leave unattended belongings be."
Reginald Percival Grenfell:
The sound of a bag with... what ever all she has in it can be heard
"I wish you a pleasant evening." And with that, heavy footsteps leaving - back towards the dining cart - can be
heard, before fading.

It's a late night when the stop comes up. The train's engine stops chuffing out smoke
and the huge metal beast grinds to a halt. There are two men on the platform. One of them looks fine. The other
looks like death warmed over. The man that looks fine has a suitcase and a dog. The man that looks like he
belongs six feet under has a suitcase tucked under both arms. There is a cobalt six gun on his hip.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:

Oj that works kindaCrystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire is still holes up in second-guess, having barricaded a sleeper car.
Well, a compartment.Crystal Saint Claire:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is nearby where Crystal is staying.
"Hey, Missy Crystal? We've stopped."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"You wanna see who's gonna get on?"
"...Y'been in there an awful long while."
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"....is he still on the train?"
"Ishmael would get like that sometimes. She'd always come out for ma's cookin
though."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...Who's still on the train?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks out the window.
"Oh hey, this guy's got a dog."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...the monster"Crystal Saint Claire:
Alexander Hauswald waits for the train to come to a full stop, his face neutral. He checks- one last time-
that his suitcase and the gun on his hip are still there, and that Sacks is held on the leash.
"...Dunno what you're talking about, but I don't think there's any monsters about. I'm
going to go greet the new fellas, eh?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Cassie-May O'Brien came over with another mug of tea. Come to think of it, you don't think she slept
since you met her.
"Whuh, we takin' passengers?"Cassie-May O'Brien:

Cassie-May O'Brien sipped her coffee.

The sounds of moving furniture are evident from the other side of the door.Crystal Saint Claire:
"Someone come on that scared the poor girl?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Reminds me, I ever ask your name train waiting buddy?"Wily Galen:

"Some fella's getting on."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Cassie-May O'Brien leans out of the window to take a good look at the two.
"Yer shittin' me, we're finally gonna get off this damn train?"Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"Nope, takin on another passenger."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Well I'm Galen, Wily Galen."Wily Galen:
"Maybe two."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"One of em's got some kinda dog."
Crystal Saint Claire looks like she hasn't slept in at least 24 hours.
"Work up in Kansas city."Wily Galen:
Alexander Hauswald points at the dog by his side. For the life of you, you can't tell what this thing is.
You're not entirely sure it's a DOG.

Alexander Hauswald pauses. And offers his hand for a shake.
"Bounty hunter."Alexander Hauswald:
"Nice to meet you Hauswald."Wily Galen:
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers looks at the... thing. "Uhh, good... doggy? Ah think?"
"...Delano."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Yeah?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano peeks in.
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers blinks and then shakes his hand. "Callie Mathers. Texas Ranger."
Wily Galen places his hand in Alexander's for a shake. Galen's hand is cold, far too cold.

Alexander Hauswald doesn't seem to be disturbed- or, rather, if he is, he does a fantastic job hiding it.
"Fair enough."
"I have the Opus."Crystal Saint Claire:
"...Fair."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Alexander Hauswald snaps his finger at the mongrel by his feet. "Come on, Sacks. We're going."
"Whatcha need me for, Miss Crystal?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Wily Galen steps up onto the train with a little jig and heads towards the sleeper compartments. He walks
past most of the others on the way there. He leaves behind a peculiar smell of light rot.
"To explain to Whitney if I must abscond."Crystal Saint Claire:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano coughs at the stench that passes by.
"...Yeah, sure, miss Crystal. I ken do that."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks back, anticipating the other entrant.
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"...I don't trust him either, Sacks. Still. We go where we called."Alexander Hauswald:
Crystal Saint Claire walks after the slightly rotted man
Alexander Hauswald follows, tugging gently on the leash.
Cassie-May O'Brien wiggled her nose.
"Excuse me, sir? Why do you smell of Death? Are you one of the mortially challenged?"Crystal Saint Claire:
Cassie-May O'Brien tensed up.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is standing near the door of the first train compartment.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks out as Alexander approaches.
Wily Galen opens a sleeper compartment with his foot and pokes his head in to look around. After
ascertaining that no one is occupying it, he trots in and tosses both suitcases down.
Does Cassie-May recognize this person from her earlier misadventures or
something?
(From Cassie-May O'Brien):
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers sniffs, getting a good whiff of the smell. "Well shoot, looks like we might jus'
have some... 'musical accompaniment' durin' our travels."
This one is new.(To Cassie-May O'Brien):
he is a walking dead like the others, though? Can Cassie recognize that?(From Cassie-May O'Brien):
Alexander Hauswald looks at Nephi, the stoic emotion on his face softening ever so slightly, before he
nods. "Hello."
Wily Galen twirls around on his heels and bends down to look at Crystal.
"Howdy, friend!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 29/791
Nephi "Longiron" Delano offers a hand forward to shake.
"Oh, hi."Wily Galen:
"Welcome to the motleyest crew this side of the rockies."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Good evening."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Also yes."Wily Galen:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano says, with a chuckle.
Cassie-May O'Brien nods at the dog-haver.
"Howdy, stranger. Nice beast yer got here."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I may have an ointment to help with the smell..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers eyes the dog warily, never quite sure with supernatural stuff
Alexander Hauswald shakes the hand, before looking at Cassie. There's an actual emotion on his face
now- even if you can tell what it is.
"Thank you. His name's Sacks."Alexander Hauswald:
Wily Galen straightens up and removes his hat to scratch at a tattered mop of hair on top of his head. The
man does not appear to have eyes.
"Sacks? Aww. Who's a good boy?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano leans down, looking at the dog.
"If you do not mind smelling like either a young girl or an engine, instead."Crystal Saint Claire:
"An' mah name's Cassie-May. Jus' call meh Cassie or Cas. Yew?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I think I'll pass, but thanks for the offer."Wily Galen:
"How do you see things? Do you? Is it hard?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Mmmm?"Wily Galen:
"Oh, the eyes."
The dog stares at Nephi. You're not sure if he understands you, but he doesn't seem to
appreciate it too much.
Alexander Hauswald:
"Can you hide things in fake eyes in the sockets?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"I can still see."Wily Galen:
"...Thaaasss a good boy."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Maybe not as a good as I used to, but I manage."Wily Galen:
"Alexander. No nicknames."Alexander Hauswald:
"Would putting fake eyes in the sockets impede your vision?"Crystal Saint Claire:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano gently pats the dog.
"Something to do with...magic or something else."Wily Galen:
"Oh. I'm Nephi Delano. Most folks call me Longiron.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I don't go in much for that."Wily Galen:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is wearing a weatherbeaten duster, obvious hand-me-down clothes, and two
rifles in scabbards on his back.
"So Alexander, how'd ya come ta be travelin' with... Sacks, was it? Yeah, with Sacks
here."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"Yer gunne have ta live wit' Alex, sugercube."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Alexander Hauswald stays silent, nodding at Nephi in acknowledgement.
"...but you could sneak little tiny flasks wherever you went! You'd just have to make them
look like eyeballs!"
Crystal Saint Claire:
"Shucks, I think you're gonna fit in around here just fine."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"..."Wily Galen:
"... Fair enough." he says to Cassie before looking at Callie.Alexander Hauswald:
"Walked with me from New York."
"Or diamonds, or small but important things!"Crystal Saint Claire:
Oh no. He's a YANKEE.Alexander Hauswald:
Wily Galen squints at Crystal with his sockets. It looks unsettling.
Crystal Saint Claire squints back with her cloudy eyes.
"New York? Mister Alexander, you gotta tell me!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"What was it like?"
"You're not a normal little girl are you?"Wily Galen:
"I always wanted to visit New York!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"New York, ya say? An he ain't tried ta attack ya or nothin?"Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"No, sir! I am most at home amongst abnormalities, to a degree."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Things I can study, and that cannot..."
Crystal Saint Claire trails off.
"There an, end to that sentence?"Wily Galen:
"No sir."Crystal Saint Claire:

"New York's big. Too big."
can Cassie recognize Wily as undead much like the one she encountered before?(From Cassie-May O'Brien):
"...Oh."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano falls a little bit more quiet then sits down.
Oh yeah. It's pretty obvious he's not amongst the living.(To Cassie-May O'Brien):
The mutt, meanwhile, lies on his stomach, calmly judging you all.Alexander Hauswald:
"...'M kinda concerned 'bout th' other guy."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I am an engineer, sir! We are meant to ignore most oddities, unless dangerous!"Crystal Saint Claire:
Alexander Hauswald follows Nephi's steps, sitting down as well. "Got the letter too?"
"Sure did."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Ain' nothin' good comin' from folks like him."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano flashes it from his duster pocket.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano says, more as if to reassure himself than anyone else.
"Sure there are."Alexander Hauswald:
Wily Galen throws one arm back and braces himself on the bed of the sleeper compartment as he adopts
a relaxed lean.
"...Not around the Ranger..." He mumbles under his breath.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Cassie-May O'Brien stared flatly at Nephi while taking a sip of coffee.
"Sure them are. Dead but nawt done, them are. Met 'em before. Bad news, the lot."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"What happens up at oven MIT?"Wily Galen:
"I got a letter recently giving me an excuse to leave Colorado, so I did."Crystal Saint Claire:
"...Ranger?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Mostly education."Crystal Saint Claire:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks over towards Callie.
"Never got much of that."Wily Galen:
"...Why nawt?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers chuckles. "Ya really think Ah didn't guess y'azll knew there were?"
"..."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald rubs the back of his neck.
"I remember a few odd classes in demonology they required we take. Something about
being able to rebut arguments that Ghost Rock was the soul of the innocents and such."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"...No, Sacks. I'm not telling anyone. Stay silent."Alexander Hauswald:
hi YuppiedimVitrarius:
Alexander Hauswald looks at the dog, seemingly conversing with him.
"So, you're telling me it's not congealed soul juice?"Wily Galen:
((Also hi, Yupster))Alexander Hauswald:
"...Miss Callie's the only law dog here."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Welp, guess we're all on th' same page, 'side from mistah sharpshootah there."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien motioned at Nephi.
Hello hello!Yuppie b.:
"An' long as none of y'all take a shot at me, we're gonna get along jus' fine."Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"Not even t'keep a secret?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"No sir. Ghost Rock is a silly name. It is simply a porous form of coal containing densities
sulphur, creating the screaming noise and brimstone odor."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"That works for me."Alexander Hauswald:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano frowns.
"Well, could have fooled me."Wily Galen:
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers smirks. "Now if ya sing 'Dixie' fer me, Ah might jus' deputize ya too."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano hmmphs!
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Don't need to. Thank you."Alexander Hauswald:
"So, Ah'm gunna take first watch on tha' walkin' dead friend of yers, Alex. Who's gunne
change meh in two hours?"
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...An'. fer the record, where's he?"
"We're taking watches now?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Are you tired? I can go back to my fort..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"He's not dangerous."Alexander Hauswald:
There was a knock upon the door AlexanderWhitney G. Elieen:
"...An' Crystal? An' our amazon nun?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I could use a nap, but it's not essential anymore."Wily Galen:
"Annoying, yes. Not Dangerous."Alexander Hauswald:
"....Amazon nun?"
"...Sounds like her now."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I like to close my eyes and not think about things for a while."Wily Galen:
"Eeeeyup. C'mere in, Whitney!"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Can't quite sleep right anymore."Wily Galen:
"That's as close as I can get."
The door opens...Whitney G. Elieen:
"I have been trying to eat better about sleeping. Whitney lets me sleep with her."Crystal Saint Claire:
(giggity)Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"It saves a bed, and I get cold easily. "Crystal Saint Claire:
And in steps an incredibly large woman. Her body hunched over ever so slightly so as not to
hit the celling. A thick set of blond hair atop sparkling blue eyes and an almost impossibly beautiful smile.
Whitney G. Elieen:

"Makes sense."Wily Galen:
"Good evening all of you...I have returned from my evening exercises."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Might do that if anyone ever wanted to bunk up with me these days."Wily Galen:
"Hey miss Eileen." He's still getting it wrong.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Only one I know of that might do it is Billy."Wily Galen:
"And I see the lord has graced us with even more company!"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Sure did."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"He's been off for..."Wily Galen:
"Couple weeks now?"
Wily Galen strokes an imaginary length of beard with his free hand.
"Have you considered warm, slightly damp blankets? The feel is similar to human
companionship..."
Crystal Saint Claire:
Alexander Hauswald just stares a the massive nun, confused. One hand slowly reached to hold an
absolutely terrified Sacks.
"...Hello."Alexander Hauswald:
"Warm and damp don't go together too well when you're trying not to rot."Wily Galen:
"I prefer not to make whatever's keeping me like this too hard."
Cassie-May O'Brien sipped her coffee, grinning and watching the scene so far.
"Do not be frightened...no good soul should ever live in fear of a servant of the lord."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Whitney Gould Elieen. I am blessed to meet you two."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers chuckles as she leans back and lights a cigar
"Than perhaps a heated stone?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"She's a good one, Mister Alexander. No need to stand on a-flutter!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...Alexander Hauswald." He says eventually, offering his hand to Whitney, pointing at the
mongrel in the other hand. "This is Sacks."
Alexander Hauswald:
A pot full of rocks, boiled and dried, would likely be free of microbial life."Crystal Saint Claire:
"That's better."Wily Galen:
"Nephi, Callie, y'all saw Crystal anywhere?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Whitney G. Elieen reaches forward and grips it with a smile. Her grip is firm. There was a great deal of
strength there...
"Alexander and Sacks. I shall say a prayer for the both of you."Whitney G. Elieen:
"She ran off somewhere."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Uhh... think she followed the corpse."Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
Alexander Hauswald just shakes it, his face betraying a hint of uneasiness.
"...Thank you."Alexander Hauswald:
"...He ain't a corpse."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"To thank the lord that he brought you with us...I assume you as well are answering the call of
the Marshall?"
Whitney G. Elieen:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano grumbles.
"A corpse you say...?"Whitney G. Elieen:
Alexander Hauswald nods. "Everyone here got the letter?"
"Yup."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Alexander Hauswald seems to connect the dots.
"He's a leper."Alexander Hauswald:
"Not a corpse."
"...See, now that's something that's not crazy talk."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Cassie-May O'Brien tensed up. She moved the coffee mug to the left hand and rested her right on her
revolver, then powerwalked out of the wagon in search of Crystal.
"Crystal? Y'all okay there?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Crystal Saint Claire leans out a door.
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers goes out the door, watching Cassie, her own hand on the handle of her revolver
Wily Galen pokes his head out of the door above the shorter Crystal.
"Yes, though I think I may be bothering my new mortially challenged friend."Crystal Saint Claire:
"A leper...an ancient and most wretched disease."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Jesus healed the lepers, didn't he, miss Eileen?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Shit, is there a leper on the train?"Wily Galen:
"Cruel as sin to the afflicted. Whomever your friend is I shall say a prayer for him."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Not a friend."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald shrugs.
"Through the power of God Nephi nothing is impossible."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Y'all don't look like no leper to me, sugercube."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien stared intensely at Wily.
"Undead, though, eeyup."Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Mortially challenged."Crystal Saint Claire:
"I prefer dead."Wily Galen:
"Potayto, potahto."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Five dollar words were never my strong suit."Wily Galen:
"Hands where Ah can see 'em."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Let them deal with it."
"It means you were bad at dying sir."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Whatever it is. Leper or no."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Or you'll fill me full of lead?"Wily Galen:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano pulls his hat down over his eyes.
Alexander Hauswald just sighs, facepalming.
"On a train."Wily Galen:
"Please do not shoot him."Crystal Saint Claire:
"What're you good at, mister Alexander?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Right after I've had a pleasant conversation with Miss Crystal?"Wily Galen:
"No, Sacks. Not until they do something dumb."Alexander Hauswald:
"I would rather not bury anyone tonight."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Ain' one to make the first shot, stranger, but Ah know yer kind. Don'cha cause no trouble
here, comprende?"
Cassie-May O'Brien:
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers steps forward and flashes her badge. "Teas Ranger. Ya got a good hold on that
manitou in yer head?"
"And digging two holes is difficult at my size."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Wasn't planning on it."Wily Galen:
"I was just catching a ride back to Kansas city."
Alexander Hauswald looks up at Nephi. "Shooting. Tracking. Treating animals. Know a thing or two about
occult things."
"Ye better."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien nodded and sipped her coffee.
"Oh! We're headed to Kansas City!"Crystal Saint Claire:
"You and everybody else on this train, apparently."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Fer erryun' involved."Cassie-May O'Brien:

"The Divine will at work~"Whitney G. Elieen:
"He has delivered unto us the gift of company."
"God's got better things to do."Alexander Hauswald:
"Please stop launching about with threats. Be clear. Be concise."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Well, nice to meet you too Miss itchy trigger finger."Wily Galen:
Pauncing*Crystal Saint Claire:
"God always has time for his children." She says with a smile.Whitney G. Elieen:
"I'm gonna go take a nap, unless you want to have a jaw?"Wily Galen:
"Something like 'You will be shot if you become an issue's would suffice here."Crystal Saint Claire:
Cassie-May O'Brien spat on the ground and moved her hand off her revolver.
Issue's *Crystal Saint Claire:
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers nods to the Harrowed. "Jus' know that if any trouble starts brewin' Ah'll be on
ya faster'n ya can blink."
"Tha's whut Ah said."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Well, we three seem to be the only sane ones on the train right now."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...Benefit of doubt, people."Alexander Hauswald:
"He didn't do nothing."
"That is what you implied. Implications are for those unwilling to face the consequences of
following through on a proper threat, ma'am."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"Jumpin at... First guy comes on smelling of cabbages and they all jump up and start
yammering about walkin dead."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Alexander Hauswald shoots a dirty glare at Sacks."
"That is what I was taught in Psychology, anyway."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Buncha wackos."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Cassie-May O'Brien sipped at her coffee.
"Fahne, missus blabber. Ah don't trust ye, dead and walkin' stranger, so if y'all go 'round
doin' mischief, Ah ain' gunne have no problem puttin' yer in th' ground fer good. Tha' better?"
Cassie-May O'Brien:
Wily Galen draws his head back into the sleeper compartment nice and slow. He takes quiet steps over to
the bed and curls up on the edge of it. The two suitcases afford him little room, but he doesn't seem to
mind.
"Wacko adventurer, a reb, and a scientist."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Crystal Saint Claire scribbles something in her small, leather bound journal.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano grumbles.

"I think he understood the first time. My correction was for future instances."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Y'all talk too much."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...I should likely sleep soon... Have any of you seen Whitney?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Yeah, she's back with us."Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"Back wit' th' others."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien thumbed over her shoulder.
"...We're gonna get along fine.Alexander Hauswald:
Sacks likes most of you."
"Well that's great to hear!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"He's a good dog. Love dogs."
"Had a golden retriever back home."
"...What kinda breed is he? Sacks, I mean."
Crystal Saint Claire runs off to find Whitney for bedtime!
Crystal Saint Claire knocks on the for to the compartment.
Whitney G. Elieen goes to open the door
"Crystal...welcome sister!"Whitney G. Elieen:
Alexander Hauswald shrugs. "No idea. Probably a mongrel."
"Tell me do you know the hour?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Whitney!"Crystal Saint Claire:
"...No, Sacks. Your word isn't good enough."Alexander Hauswald:
"Well, Mongrel dogs are the really smart ones, y'know."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Crystal Saint Claire hugs Whitney. She reaches MAYBE the larger woman's hip.
"Nick your wallet while you're sleeping, they will."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Is it bedtime yet?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Go on a vacation to Miami."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Not this one. Used to be dumber than a sack of hammers."Alexander Hauswald:
Whitney G. Elieen returns the hug with as much strength as she could without crushing the poor young
girl.
"Right you are! Tomorrow we shall arise bright and early."Whitney G. Elieen:
"I enjoy my mornings with you very much after all."
Crystal Saint Claire nods.
"You are a good listener."Crystal Saint Claire:

"We gotta be in Kansas by now anyways."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"We got a day or two."Alexander Hauswald:
"Tell me then. Are you ready to go to bed now? And have you had a chance to say hello to
our new friend?"
Whitney G. Elieen:
Cassie-May O'Brien peeked her head into the compartment where the undead went to sleep in.
"I'll go sleep. Let's go, Sacks."Alexander Hauswald:
Wily Galen one arm is hanging off the bed. His bowler hat fell off during the transition from floor to bed.
Galen looks like a disheveled corpse. He is a disheveled corpse in most anyone's eyes.
Cassie-May O'Brien furrowed her brow and pulled back, leaning on the wall in the corridor, observing the
partially-opened door and sipping coffee from her mug in left hand, right hand resting on the grip of her
revolver.
Alexander Hauswald passes by Cassie, stopping briefly to look at the scene.
Wily Galen reaches one hand behind himself and scratches at the seat of his pants.
"If he wanted, he'd do something."Alexander Hauswald:
"No use eyeballing him."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers puts a hand on Cassie's shoulder. "Ah'll take second watch."
"...You do know I can hear you assholes standing at my door, right?"Wily Galen:
"Jus' doin' my job."Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"Can you close the door so it's harder to hear you badmouthing me?"Wily Galen:
Cassie-May O'Brien nodded at Callie.
"Ain' takin' no chances."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...You sure, Sacks? Well, no use changing your mind."Alexander Hauswald:
the dog sits down next to this commotion, ever vigilant.
"Sacks said he'll take watch."
"Look, Ah'm not biased against th' Harrowed. Ah've known a few who're great
Rangers. Jus'... the things in yer heads can be... unpredicatable... is all."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"Yeah, yeah, ain' no use keepin' on runnin' yer mouths, y'all. Go change meh in two hours,
Callie."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
Alexander Hauswald just shrugs, going to find his own place to sleep in.
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers nods and goes to catch some sleep before her shift
Wily Galen turns over and rearranges himself on top of his bed.
(Also the dog is still sitting there. MENACINGLY)Alexander Hauswald:
Cassie-May O'Brien just stays there with her gun and coffee.

The train to Kansas is rolling along smooth as silk across a long stretch of desert land.
Most everyone is in the seated portion of the train. Reginald is in his cabin snoozing still. The vitally challenged
fella, Galen, is still sleeping like the dead in his cabin.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
(I shall be off for a bit. Feel free to do things in the mean time.)
Whitney G. Elieen has her head bowed low. Perhaps in prayer. Perhaps in rest. Try as she might poor
Crystal was squeezed in a little tight.
Poage seemed satisfied, asleep in Whitney's bed. She slept the kind of sleep one experiences after a long
trip.
Crystal Saint Claire *
Oh hey there's peopleUrbanCritter:
Alexander Hauswald is tending to Sacks, his face filled with gruffness as he tries to readjust the canine's
collar.
Crystal Saint Claire is hugging Whitney's arm like a lamppost, mumbling nonsense in her sleep.
In particular, a few thing deepest.Crystal Saint Claire:
repeat
But y'all don't care about that flummery. S'just sleeptalkin'!
(Oh my gosh you gave Sacks his own icon)Alexander Hauswald:
The train goes over a fair to middling size bump in the tracks. It disturbs stomachs and
some small mugs of coffee. Sacks crawls out from under the table where he was resting and begins to stretch.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Alexander Hauswald absentmindedly pets him, lost in thought.
Sacks does a big doggie yawn that ends with him smacking his lips.
[Traps are gay]Sacks:
Sacks barks something that Alexander can't quite interpret. Doggo probably wants
more pets pardner.

Whitney G. Elieen breaths shallow, restful breaths as Crystal hangs on her arms as tight as a sleeping girl
can muster. The giantess's eyes were closed. Her expression one of absolute serenity.
Sacks takes a few steps towards the giant nun, looking at her with mild terror. He's trying to sniff in her
direction from afar, confused.
Whitney G. Elieen 's left eye slowly opens
Sacks makes an alarmed step back!
Whitney G. Elieen smiles
Whitney G. Elieen puts a finger to her lips as she motions her head towards the sleeping Crystal.
Sacks 's ears flatten as he nods, slooooowly making his way back to Alexander. And hiding under his
seat.
Whitney G. Elieen closes her eyes again
Whitney G. Elieen takes a deep breath
Not really here yetdimVitrarius:

Are all the textures weirdly low quality for everyone else or is it just me?Nevermore:
Crystal Saint Claire shifts in Whitney's arms as the train bumps, making a noise halfway between a groan
and a yawn before settling back down.
I'm on mobiileCrystal Saint Claire:
One minute
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has started tapping his foot in impatience.
"Feels like we've been on this train for the hairy edge of forever."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Any minute now."Alexander Hauswald:
"That's what I keep saying!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Give it time. Might be an hour. Might be longer."Alexander Hauswald:
"...Fff."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...Y'got a deck of cards, Mister Alex?"
Whitney G. Elieen stays nice, steady and silent through it all. Giving the poor girl someone to lean on
through this bumpy, largely uncomfortable train ride.
"Don't play cards."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald shrugs.
The textures are low quality cuz that's the way they came.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"Got no luck."Alexander Hauswald:

"Ma taught me how to play poker for chores. Fun way to pass the time when there's eight ways for them to be
divided."
"Brother used to play a lot."Alexander Hauswald:
"Never was any good. I always ended up having to do the sweeping."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Stopped when the debts started piling up."Alexander Hauswald:
"See, that's why I never play for money. I like to play for bullets. Got plenty of those."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano jangles the vest he wears under his duster. Jingle jangle goes the bullets stuffed
into every single possible pocket with more added on besides.

Alexander Hauswald looks at him.
"...What?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Stay away from fire."Alexander Hauswald:
"S'not a sin if it's not money."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano sits, satisfied with his cleverness.
"Too much gunpowder on one person."Alexander Hauswald:
"You'll explode the second someone lights a cigar."
"I gotta carry all this though. That gatlin' rifle I got? Chews through bullets like
nobody's business."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"You got any of those newfangled shootin irons, mister Alexander?"
Alexander Hauswald , in response, pulls out a Colt Army revolver.
"That answers it?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Ooh. You customize it?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...I don't need customizing."Alexander Hauswald:
"Everybody needs some customizing! What good's havin a special gun if everybody
don't know about it?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Really, when ya think about it, a famous shootist's gun is just as special as he is!"
"I don't need customizing."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald slides the gun back into the holster, giving it a little pat.
"Don'tcha want to be famous?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Figgure that's half the reason most folks head out West to begin with."
"I got bigger fish to fry than fame."Alexander Hauswald:

Crystal Saint Claire snugs up against Whitney, mumbling something about the river
"I don't care why or for what reason. He's a dead man one way or the other."Alexander Hauswald:
"...Reason's real important. You do the right thing for the wrong reasons, it's still a
sin."

Alexander Hauswald looks at Nephi, sighing.
"I'll go to hell happy."Alexander Hauswald:

"Might have a pack."Alexander Hauswald:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano reaches into a belt pouch right in front of another kind of package and pulls out
a thick wad of cash and some coins.
Sacks looks at Alexander with his best puppy dog eyes at the mention of lunch.
"...About... $80 union, and..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Some Reb odds and ends."
"Think they'll take union cash here."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald turns to Sacks.
"You just had breakfast."Alexander Hauswald:
"Probably not."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
, is it next day?(From dimVitrarius):
"But there'll probably be a bank that'll do exchanges."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
It means that Cassie had to sleep, yes?(From dimVitrarius):
After you picked up Alexander and the walking stiff? Yes.(To dimVitrarius):
Also yes.(To dimVitrarius):
I think we should make the nightmares roll, then! ..and sort out the Fate Chips.(From dimVitrarius):
"Probably. Heard from someone gold's worth the same everywhere."Alexander Hauswald:
"Why I keep most of the rest in coins."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Gold's gold."
"Course, Ghost Rock's worth more these days. Way more."
"Ghost Rock's bad."Alexander Hauswald:
"Sacks doesn't like it."
Alrighty roo. Make the nightmare roll and we'll sort out fate chips after we resolve that.(To dimVitrarius):
"What's the problem with Ghost Rock? It's just really good coal."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Not according to Sacks."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald idly pets the dog.
"No idea what it is, but it's bad."Alexander Hauswald:
You can roll it in the main chat or gmroll it. Your pick.(To dimVitrarius):
"He's just a silly ol'dog, that's what he is."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Sacks doesn't even bother growling. He just gives Nephi a long, disapproving look.

Cassie-May O'Brien woke up with a start, sitting up in panic with bloodshot eyes and hand on her
revolver. She blinked and rubbed her face with both hands after a second.
"...Uuuuuuuughhh..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Ey!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Language!"
"Y'kiss your mother with that mouth?"
"And yours too."Cassie-May O'Brien:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano frowns.
Cassie-May O'Brien stood up, scratching her head with a scowl.
Alexander Hauswald stifles a snicker.

"...Coffee. Must... coffee. No talky to Cassie."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Well yer a..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Dern it."
"Don't."Alexander Hauswald:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano grumps back into his seat.
Cassie-May O'Brien waved at Nephi with one hand, rubbing her face with the other, apparently still trying
to get her bearings.
Nephi's momma raised a polite boy, perhaps polite to a fault.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Whitney G. Elieen opens her eyes slowly
"Sassy-livered blinkspot..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Whitney G. Elieen gives Crystal a little shake. "Rise sister...it is getting close to our time."
Cassie-May O'Brien slaps herself and groans, then looks around for means to make herself coffee.
Nephi mumbles under his breath.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
I'm gonna try to use Riducule mostly deadpan-style(From Crystal Saint Claire):

Crystal Saint Claire squirms a little, getting comfy.

Cassie-May O'Brien returns with a sour expression and a steaming mug of coffee.
"Mmmiss Eileen? Miss Crystal? Yew two awake?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Cassie-May O'Brien turned to Nephi.
"Sawrry, pardnah. Ah git real cranky in them mornings until Ah can git mah cuppa joe."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Crystal Saint Claire holds onto Whitney's hand, trying to pull her along. She might as well be tugging a
fencepost.

"...Nephi? Cummawn, pardnah. Didn' mean nothin' bad."dimVitrarius:
*Cassie-May O'Brien:
The back door of the train shudders open and a familiar face appears. The Conductor
shoves a rattling metal trolley through the door. It jounces a little on the door jamb, but the covered plate and the
large pitcher of coffee stay relatively still.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:

"Coffee!"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...Guess it's coming to us."Alexander Hauswald:
Cassie-May O'Brien quickly downed remaining half of her mug and extended the empty container to the
Conductor.
"Fill meh up, sugercube."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Look, I don't have anything else to do but make you guys as comfortable as possible."Conductor:
"Alexander Hauswald:
"...Drive the train?"
"The train goes back, and forth, and sometimes it changes tracks."Crystal Saint Claire:
Conductor squeezes around the trolley, grabbing the coffee pitcher as he does. He obliges Cassie and
fills her mug back up full of steamy black goodness.
" The lord has delivered unto us a bounty it seems."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Really, if it needs to stop suddenly, that is what the conductor is for, no?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Ohh, yer a godsend. If y'all say yer got some breakfast on this trolley here..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Is there anything sweet?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Eggs, bacon, toast, beans, ketchup, and salt."Conductor:
"Think there might be a few toasted apples in there."
"Gimme."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"How much is there?"Alexander Hauswald:
Cassie-May O'Brien took a seat with a grin.
"Beans and water will do just fine for me."Whitney G. Elieen:
"I hope it's enough for all of you."Conductor:
"Ah'm takin' full course. Girl's gotta eat!"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Conductor takes a few plates out from under the cart and begins distributing the food accordingly.
"Toast and eggs. Sacks'll have beans and bacon."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald glares at the dog.
"One of these days I'm going to get some help."Conductor:
"No, I'm not going to ask if the beans are organic."Alexander Hauswald:
"...Yer whut."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Conductor finishes piling up a few plates and glasses. Then he gives Alexander a look.
Alexander Hauswald takes a step forward to help the conductor.

"Th' fuck is organic?"Conductor:
"I don't know."Alexander Hauswald:
"But Sacks wants it."
"That's the dog right?"Conductor:
Alexander Hauswald nods.
"He's a picky eater."Alexander Hauswald:
Conductor grabs the plates and walks up the length of the train car, doling out the ordered food and drink.
Cassie-May O'Brien rolled her eyes with mouth full of beans and bacon and eggs.
Crystal Saint Claire takes toast and beans and ketchup and a toasted apple!
Alexander Hauswald sets Sacks' plate next to him, and starts eating his own.
Sacks sniffs curiously at his plate. Before starting to nibble at the bacon.
Conductor walks up to Crystal and gives her a plate. Then he hands Whitney a plate full of beans
accompanied by a cool, clear glass of water.
Whitney G. Elieen takes a simple bowl of beans and water herself
"Mind if I squeeze past you two?"Conductor:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano also got breakfast and is having plenty of munch along the way
"Oh! I apopogize..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Nephi, y'all fergive meh or nawt?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Crystal Saint Claire wriggles back past Whitney with her food
"Thanks, there might be a rough patch coming up soon."Conductor:
Crystal Saint Claire eats methodically, a small spoonful of beans being placed on a small bite of toast.
The apple is being saved for last.Crystal Saint Claire:
Whitney G. Elieen eats her simple meal as slowly as she could. A few bites of beans followed by a sip of
water.
"Yeah, yeah. I fergive ya."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Don't know if they cleared out the riff raff that was hanging around here last time I came through."Conductor:
Crystal Saint Claire also tries to drink as much water as she can! Hydration is important!
"Gewd."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano drops back into one of the seats.
Cassie-May O'Brien gulps a mouthful of beans.
"Riffraff?"Cassie-May O'Brien:

Alexander Hauswald stops chewing, looking at the conductor.
"Folks who don't have anything better to do than hang around and shoot shit."Conductor:
"Tha' much Ah reckon, jus' how much an' how well armed?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Have you considered getting security?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"...Got a feeling we're security."Alexander Hauswald:
"We're security."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Eeeyup."
"Cheap pistols last time I came around. Though that has been a while."Conductor:
Cassie-May O'Brien grinned at Alexander.
"...I have signed no such contract"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Y'all agreed to a bullet in yer gut?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Alexander Hauswald has the barest hint of a smile back at Cassie.
"We're marshals. Oriented or not."Alexander Hauswald:
Conductor lopes up the train and passes through a car door. It shuts behind him with a metallic clack.
"I am not of the mercenary persuasion"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Well someone's gotta keep us in good nick, right?Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Ain' answerin' mah question."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"That's probably yer job, miss Crystal."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Please word your question in a more comprehensible fashion, then."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid of them for the lord your God goes with you; and
he will not forsake you."
Whitney G. Elieen:
Cassie-May O'Brien quickly finished up her monster of a breakfast, belched into her fist, finished her
coffee, and stood up to retrieve her stuff.
"God is with me...whatever could I fear of man and his foolishness?"Whitney G. Elieen:
Crystal Saint Claire digs into her carpet bag and pulls out a pistol and two little pouches.
Cassie-May O'Brien makes sure her Winchester, double-barrel and revolver are all loaded and ready.
"Who here is good wth pistols?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"I am."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Alexander Hauswald lifts a hand.

Alexander Hauswald points at Sacks.
"...A superstition is not a dog."Crystal Saint Claire:
"You asked."Alexander Hauswald:
"He says the dog's superstitious."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Sacks doesn't like Ghost Rock."Alexander Hauswald:
Cassie-May O'Brien puts her revolver and shotgun in their respective holsters, and leans on the wall with
her Winchester rifle at the ready.
"Ah."Crystal Saint Claire:
"...Never heard of a superstitious dog in my life, tho."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
(be back in a tick.)Conductor:
"Then Ghost Steel would likely be an issue for him as well?"Crystal Saint Claire:
Alexander Hauswald pulls his sixshooter out.
Sacks makes a silent whine.
"I think he'll manage."Alexander Hauswald:
Crystal Saint Claire is holding a very strange gun.
"Whuzzat?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"This is a gun."Crystal Saint Claire:
"I cal it my Opus Magnum!"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano stifles a snicker.
"... That's not a gun."Alexander Hauswald:
"...Awrigh', how's it speshul?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"It is a variant of the Lemat Grapeshot Pistol, made of Ghost Steel."Crystal Saint Claire:
"As such, it is lighter, more durable..."
"...You made a ghost shotgun."Alexander Hauswald:
"...Huh. Nifty, sugercube."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Alex?"
"Yeah?"Alexander Hauswald:
"And capable of loading rounds with a higher powder-to-not-powder ratio. That is not a
technical term."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"Also it has two settings. the pistol setting is a nine-shot revolver."

Alright fellasNevermore:
?Crystal Saint Claire:
I'm working with Doc on a new initiative system since the one the game comes with is slow as
molasses.
Nevermore:
okCrystal Saint Claire:
This is mostly for Varmus' benefit, really, as he's the only one who knows how slow it can be.Nevermore:
So, currently, we've worked out that when rolling for initiative you roll your Quickness stat normally. This
determines when you can take your first action. You get a number of actions equivalent to your Quickness dice or
5, whichever is lower.

((Wouldn't it be easier to just roll Quickness?))Alexander Hauswald:
It would be.Cassie-May O'Brien:
But having multiple actions is kinda a big thing in Deadlands.
You can get way more or less than two actions.Nevermore:
If two or more want to act at once, the one with higher Quickness roll this round acts first.Cassie-May O'Brien:
Fair?

Having multiple actions is also important for movement.Nevermore:
You can move and shoot in the same action.

Crystal Saint Claire is busy loading bullets into her gun one at a time, very carefully.
Crystal Saint Claire has CLEARLY never been in an actualy gunfight before.

"Remember to take cover."
"Make sure yer not loadin' those bullets in backwards."Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"If the Lord gives us cover we should hide in it."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Good thinkin'."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Lord could give us more than cover."Alexander Hauswald:
"The main issue here is that we do not know where these train robbers will approach from,
and therefore cannot set up our defense appropriately."
Crystal Saint Claire:
Almost done.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Yay!Crystal Saint Claire:
"Oh!"
Crystal Saint Claire remembers something!
"Hmmmm?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"What is it?"
Moondew, we can expect robbers and rabble-rousers and other riveting rapscallions to try to ravage
our ride.
dimVitrarius:

It's a hard shot, but Callie manages to take aim through the narrow margin afforded
her by the bouncing train, the slight amount of bandit visible, and the bouncing baddie's mount. The bullet kicks
him in the side of the head and he pitches off his horse.

Big Bawss Bandit opens the door and walks in. His cotton cloth bandages are flowing in the wind that
passes through the train. He is holding a six gun in one hand and a shotgun on his back. The only thing
visible through the bandages and metal plates is one red eye and grimy nubs of fingers.

Big Bawss Bandit takes the three bullets straight to his head. The sheer force of the impact forces him
back onto the ground. He lays still for a moment. He scrabbles to his feet a moment later. His face is a

You tap the massive bandit on the head with the metal rod. It would be nothing coming
from someone smaller and less coated down with muscle, but from Whitney... It knocks him out and stops just shy
of caving his skull in.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"...Nice work!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Conductor pokes his head out. He has a scrap of his shirt pressed to his hear. The scrap is soaked
through with blood.
"It was not my work that felled him..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Is it over?"Conductor:
"...Guess we're done then."Alexander Hauswald:

Whitney G. Elieen frowns

Alexander Hauswald calmly loads his gun.
"..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"We should get him out of this armor, cuff him, and take a look at his wounds."Crystal Saint Claire:
Conductor takes the red scrap of cloth off his ear.
Cassie-May O'Brien reloads herself.
"Preferably in that order."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Oh, I'll be fine."Conductor:
Whitney G. Elieen leans forward
Whitney G. Elieen reaches her hand out...

them from their wounds
That's a pass.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"No, Sacks, it's not my fault he didn't listen."Alexander Hauswald:
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers coils her whip back up and then reloads her revolver. "Told 'im he was under

"That...feels better."Conductor:
Whitney G. Elieen places her hand upon the injured ear...
Crystal Saint Claire starts removing the armor.
"Wait..."Conductor:
Whitney G. Elieen closes her eyes
Conductor feels the side of his head.
"The...hell?"Conductor:
Whitney G. Elieen grimmaces ever so slightly
Alexander Hauswald holsters his gun, sighing.
"Thanks for the new ear."Conductor:

Whitney G. Elieen pulls back, rubbing at her own ears, she opens her eyes with a smile
Whitney G. Elieen shakes her head
"Don't thank me..."Whitney G. Elieen:

Crystal Saint Claire is removing armor
"I'm going to go and check on the engine."Conductor:

"Sacks, watch the big man."Alexander Hauswald:
Crystal Saint Claire holds out her pistol.
"...Whitney, was it?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Yes...yes Whitney."Whitney G. Elieen:

"Good job."Alexander Hauswald:
"Here. If he gets out of the cuffs just shoot him. It's set to shotgun right now, at this range
the armor will be insufficient."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"Might want to stop his bleeding."Alexander Hauswald:
Cassie-May O'Brien holsters her rifle and begins to remove whatever armor Big Bawws is wearing.
Crystal Saint Claire starts dragging the pieces of armor up the train, towards the engine room.
Cassie-May O'Brien also removes his weapons.
Crystal Saint Claire already did that, Cassie.
"..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I have no power but what the Lord has given me...and though this one is a sinner..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Cassie-May O'Brien removes his cash, too.
"Would be a waste of keeping him alive."Alexander Hauswald:
(You can have the weapons tho)Crystal Saint Claire:
Whitney G. Elieen leans down and inspects the wounds
"The Lord works in mysterious ways...perhaps he may have use of him in his plan."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Either way it is not up to me to decide"
Alexander Hauswald leans against the window, groaning loudly. "Let's try this again."
(Can I try and hex?)Alexander Hauswald:
*Whatever those wounds may be she would reach her hand forwardWhitney G. Elieen:
Crystal manages to get a fair amount of armor off the man. You now have Big Bawws'
scrap armor.

He has about twenty bullets for the Colt Navy and five twelve gauge shells for the
shotgun.

(Can I draw my cards or did I immediately get my magic boolits?)Alexander Hauswald:
It is scrap metal armor pocked with bullet holes. There is a light coating of blood.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Regular shells.
Gimmie a tick.
Anything personalized about it?Crystal Saint Claire:
A name, or an insigina, or a rubber duck
Not the body armor.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
I took the helmet, if possible, as well.Crystal Saint Claire:
I think it's grafted onto his face.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
The face plate might have had something on it, but that's a pile of scrap that's
distributed all over his head.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
I'm an engineer, I can fix this.Crystal Saint Claire:
Granted, we'll need a doctor to separate it from his face
Cassie-May O'Brien straightens up, pocketing the shells and bullets, stuffing the Colt Navy in her belt
behind her back, and slinging the single-shot over her arm.

Gun Runner hat seems to change shape for a second. It becomes smaller and more weathered. Then he
reaches up and adjusts it. Still a sombrero.
"...Nice hat."Alexander Hauswald:
General Store Owner face becomes a little more lined and aquiline. He reaches up and smooths it out in a
moment.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano eventually comes down the stairs to the main floor, looking groggy as anything.
"Thanks ese, is that one of your friends?"Gun Runner:
"One that looks like chewed shit?"
"...Mmmister Alex?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Yes."Alexander Hauswald:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks around the room.
Alexander Hauswald turns towards Nephi.
"You folks playin cards?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano rubs his eyes.
"I just came down to see if I couldn't find a nice tall glass o'water."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"We are boy, care to join us?"General Store Owner:
((Here I expected a "Why are you sitting alone"))Alexander Hauswald:
"...Well, why not. I'm mighty tired, though."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Might be..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is interrupted by a yawn.
"Crawlin back into bed after a few hands."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I'll get you a nice cool soda if you steal the pot from me next hand."Bartender:
"...Oh yer on."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"We'll finish this one up, then deal you in."Bartender:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano pops a seat next to Alex.
"Next to last round."Bartender:
"Thrown down your money."0

Bartender puts a twenty five cent piece in the pot.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano reaches into a belt pouch in front of his other package and pulls out a sack filled
with coins.
General Store Owner scratches his cheek for a couple of seconds before doing the same.
"Usually don't like playin for cash. God says it's a sin, but everybody's gotta do
somethin to pass the time."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I don't think you two gringos have any damn tells."Gun Runner:
Gun Runner tosses a quarter into the pile of coins.
"Call and raise."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald throws fifty cents in.
"Brave fella."Bartender:
The other players slide in another quarter to match.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"Last round."Bartender:
"Make your plays."
Spirit check from both of you.

Bartender has something stretching out behind his head, like tree branches, but after a blink the figment
of Nephi's imagination is gone.
"So, Mister Alex, you got any family?"General Store Owner:
"..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I uh... I'll be back soon."
(Time for me to go arrived sooner than I expected. Going to see Kingsman, probably.)
"See you later cowpoke."Bartender:
((Am I seeing the same?))Alexander Hauswald:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks to Alex warily, unsettled a little bit.
"...Big brother. Nobody else."Alexander Hauswald:
(A little bit, but less than Nephi.)Bartender:
(More like dots swimming through Alex's vision.)
Bartender knocks on the table.
"Check."Bartender:
"Check..."General Store Owner:
"I don't trust you."Gun Runner:

Alexander Hauswald closes his eyes.

"God damn, sneaky son of a bitch."Gun Runner:
(From left to right: Bartender, General Store Manager, and Gun Runner.)

"Works fine for me."Alexander Hauswald:
(He's actually splitting it with the Gun Runner, who can replicate his hand, since he has the Joker.)Gun Runner:

The bald man with the mustache and the Gun Runner halve the pot and take their cut.Wonderful Cowboy Land:

"Thank you for the game."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald eyes them suspiciously.
"You staying for another hand?"Bartender:

Accidentally backed out of the game, gimmie a tick.Doc (GM):
Alexander, these fellas are not what they seem.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
You blink, and then you see them.
One man in a red suit with a cow's skull for a mask. The antlers stretching up into the blackness surrounding the
table. You think the bartender was sitting there. Where the General Store Manager was, there is now a white
boned skeleton wearing a red jacket. The bones gives a happy little wave. The Gun Runner has been replaced by
something...wrong. You can't see its face. When your eyes try to tell your brain what they see, the signal gets
garbled and broken. All you can tell is that he is wearing a battered Stetson and red stained riding duds.

There is, however, a sizable pile of money, and that odd card.

Alexander Hauswald checks the card, first. It seemed valuable enough for the players to be surprised by.
Holy shit.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
That's one of Hoyle's cards.
"...Well now."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald quickly stashes in in his pocket, before looking at the money.
The money looks, a bit different in this light.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
The coins are all from various ages, some look older, some look newer. Some gleam with a hint of gold in them.
Some are made from some metal that you don't know of.
All of them are, assumedly, valuable.
Best to take them all and sort through them at a later date.
"..."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald sweeps them all into his pocket. Better do this after he slept.

Cassie-May O'Brien was sitting at one of the tables, a mug of steaming coffee and a glass of whiskey that
might have had ice inside once sitting beside her heavy riding boots, perched on the wooden surface.
Alexander Hauswald climbs down, groggy, followed by that damn mutt of his. He looks around, yawning,
before taking something out- you can't make it from here- out of his shirt pocket, examine it intently,
before walking down.
"Howdy, pardnah! Slept well?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Not really."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald stretches, groaning.
"Had a strange dream."Alexander Hauswald:
"Yew an' meh both."Cassie-May O'Brien:

Alexander Hauswald lets a tiny grin break the stoic facade.
"I won, too. Got a card."Alexander Hauswald:
"Gewd fer yew, pardnah. Ah guess."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"If only. I think the bet was my brother. Things are getting foggy."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald takes a look at Sacks.\
Sacks barks.
"Ain' nothin' good yew can find in dreams, Alex."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien took a huge gulp of coffee and chased it with a sip of whiskey.
"I know. They usually aren't this vivid."UrbanCritter:

"And yes."Alexander Hauswald:
"Yes?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I'll send you to your room."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald grins again. You think.

Alexander Hauswald shrugs.
"Dumber than a sack of hammers."Alexander Hauswald:
Sacks rolls his eyes. You never knew a dog can roll his eyes.
Cassie-May O'Brien didn't seem to notice that.
"Y'all shouldn' be badmouthin' poor Nephi while he ain' here."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"That's just rude."Alexander Hauswald:
"Sacks doesn't like him. But he's alright."
"Jus' makin' a joke, pardnah."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien raised her hands defensively.
"Nuthin' bad meant."Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Can't tell some of the time. Never had enough to laugh at."Alexander Hauswald:
"Realleh naw? This gal here's thinkin' y'all gotta find yer fun where yew can, life ain' gonne

Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Well, I don't get the chance. Too busy with something."Alexander Hauswald:
"Realleh naw? Whuzzit?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Alexander Hauswald 's face grims for a second. He pulls away, heading towards the counter, and after a
minute or two with the bartender, comes back with a glass of water.
"...My brother. He's been kidnapped."Alexander Hauswald:
"...Darn, tha's awful. Ah'm real sorry ta hear that, pardnah."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Don't be. I'll find him."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald sighs, looks around, and taps his Colt Army on the glass. The liquid immediately
starts shifting color...
Cassie-May O'Brien 's eyes widened.
"...Nobody's watching us, I hope."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald keeps doing that, waiting before there's a glass of something... VAGUELY liquid that
could pass as coffee. If you had no sense of smell or had no idea what coffee was.
"...Did y'all jus' turn water ta coffee jus' like tha'."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Cheaper than buying it."Alexander Hauswald:
"Tastes like it, too."

"... It's really bad."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald thinks that changes anything.
"It's coffee."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Theoretically. It's what manitous think coffee is."Alexander Hauswald:
"...So."
Alexander Hauswald takes a sip, cringes, and takes another one.
"Why'd you agree to this?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Ta whut, Marshalin'?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Alexander Hauswald nods.
"Just curious."Alexander Hauswald:
"Ah jus' wanna help out them folks, Ah guess. An' bein' a Marshall coulda help meh wit'

Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...Noble of you.Alexander Hauswald:
I did this to find Thomas."
Crystal Saint Claire walks down the stairs, wearing a stained labcoat over a set of pajamas. She yawns,
stretches, and toddles over to the barkeeper to pester him for a cup of sasparilla.
Crystal Saint Claire gets her cup, and sits with the two faces she recognizes.
"Howdy, sleepin' princess."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Morning, kid."Alexander Hauswald:
Sacks sniffs Crystal's pajamas curiously. And barks happily!Sacks:
"So, Thomas is yer brother's name?"Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Yes, those."Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire perks up.
"You can?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"And hexslinging has to be taught by a person, not a book."Alexander Hauswald:
"When you hex, you let a manitou in your body."
"And then you do a little fight with it in your head. It can be anything. My teacher used chess, I use poker."
"And if you win, it has to do what you tell it to and scram."
"Sometimes it wins. Sometimes it has room to punch you on the way out."
Alexander Hauswald points at Sacks.
"My familiar. Longer than just a hex, but he's as smart as us now."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald moves his eyes to Sacks, sighing.
"Yes, Sacks, that includes Nephi."Alexander Hauswald:
"...So"Crystal Saint Claire:
"What if one is not Hexing"
"Do manitous often communicate with the living?"
"Woulda explain mah dreams."Cassie-May O'Brien:

"I would imagine there are outliers on either side."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Bah. I met nice ones. I met rude ones. They're all the same."Alexander Hauswald:
Cassie-May O'Brien switched to whiskey.
"So... there are some people who claim the ideas of... inventors, such as myself, are often
influenced by such beings. So I was considering an experiment."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"But for it to work, I'd need to speak to at least one Manitou, in person or through a go-between somehow."
"...Bad idea."Alexander Hauswald:
"Real bad idea."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"....Sacks says it's a bad idea too."Alexander Hauswald:
"Why?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"According to mythos, manitous can be cheated. That means they follow rules, for the most part, no?"
"It's risky. You could dieAlexander Hauswald:
. Or worse."
"If I die, I will be consigned to oblivion. Whitney told me so."Crystal Saint Claire:
"If yew die, yer soul gonne be captured by them an' tortured fer eternity in their home."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Believe meh, Ah know sumthin' 'bout it."
Cassie-May O'Brien shuddered, downed her whiskey in one shot, and chased with a huge gulp of coffe.
"...Hauswald, you've spoken with a manitou, have you not?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Perhaps you could help me!"
"I'd rather not, kid."Alexander Hauswald:
"I accepted these risks. You haven't."
"I will accept any risk necessary to further humanity's progress."Crystal Saint Claire:
"...You sure? Your life's ahead of you."Alexander Hauswald:
((Hang on, going mobile))
"...I..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire looks down again.
"I can do it. I know I can."Crystal Saint Claire:
"All I need is an idea, just to prove that they can make them."
"... lright. I'll think about it. Tell me about this experiment of yours."UrbanCritter:
"Well, sometimes inventors have odd ideas. Ideas that do not fall in line with their "usual"
vein of creations. For example, my Opus Magnum. I am, for the most part, an engineer. I focused mostly on
engines, and mechanical things."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"But one day the idea came to me almost out of nowhere. I was concerned for my safety, and about my skill
protecting myself"

"And you think the ghost shotgun is manitou work."UrbanCritter:
"And the idea came to me to make a pistol from Ghost Iron. Easier for someone of my
stature and strength to use."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"I think that, if manitous are capable of such things, the Opus Magnum was their work."
"...hum."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien crossed her arms.
"My hands, their ideas. The blueprints were my own, the conceptualization, the craft..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"But the spark, the idea... it was like lightning from a blue summer sky."
"... Interesting thought.UrbanCritter:
"So... to test this..."Crystal Saint Claire:
I'll have to find a Huckster, first."UrbanCritter:
"I would make a list. Of ideas, as they came to me. And each one, regardless of content,
regardless of morality, would at least be written down."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"I can only call them to me for hexes. Can't just drop one to talk to you."UrbanCritter:
"Pare out the most dangerous, and the blatantly unethical..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"And then attempt to bring the rest to fruition."
"The key would be letting... someone... know I would be a blank slate for that period of time."
"That no idea would be shelved without inspection."

"Well, perhaps it could be worded as a challenge?"
"Perhaps not against me, I am... informidable."
"But could one, in theory, inspire competition?"
"... We'll have to find a huckster. Or a shaman. Or something."UrbanCritter:
"They would know more, then?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"I will ask about."

(With Alex, Sacks and Crystal, at the hotel they stayed in, after morning coffee and in

Cassie-May O'Brien:
(Right.)Doc (GM):
The bell above the door makes a cling clang as Cassie and Crystal enter the general
store. The owner scrapes himself back to wakefulness in a few seconds. He glances to the two coming in the
entryway, then to the clock on the wall. He cracks his neck and smacks his lips before tipping his chair back to a
more comfy position. The store is filled with all manner of useful items, provisions, cheap guns, cheap bullets,
rope, shovels, axes, pickaxes, work clothes, slightly fancier work clothes, horse blankets, saddles, feed, and a
hundred other things.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
(It is however half past midnight. So if we're doing something it's gonna happen now- oh
great)
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Howdy, pardnah."
"Howdy miss, if you're looking for anything specific, I can help. If you're browsing, then I
see no reason for me to interfere."
General Store Owner:
"Whut wuz it y'all wanted ta check out, Crystal?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...something resistant. Cloth of some sort."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Something that would function well in a n armored vest..."
Cassie-May O'Brien just browses around for anything unusual and interesting, out of curiosity more than
need. Maybe a coffee maker she could use in the field comfortably? She was somewhat in a problem with
that lately.

General Store Owner fishes a tin of indeterminate origin from a vest pocket. It is long and metal and the
label has long been worn off. He takes a thin paper and some dried stuff out of it.

"Oh, and a book or two! I get bored sometimes on trips, so having something to read would

Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal, there is a deck of cards tucked into the pocket of a plaid work shirt. It looks a little
bruised, but the seal is still intact.
General Store Owner:
Cassie, you locate a mesh strainer. The spacing on the mesh is perfect for coffee grounds. The only problem is,
the mesh looks to be about two foot but four foot. Unless you've got a big ass coffee cup this is going to be
useless. Might be able to modify it though...
"...Hmm. Eeeyup."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien grabbed the strainer.
"How much fer tha'?"Cassie-May O'Brien:

"May I buy these?"
Whitney is huge. The only thing you can make out of this shirt is something that will cover
her chest and most of the body above that. Significant, skillful alteration will be needed for even that.
General Store Owner:
"Sure kid. Twenty five for the deck and..."
General Store Owner examines the plaid on the shirt with obvious distaste.

"Alright, thirty cent."General Store Owner:
"Fahne."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien paid up.
"Should have some tents..."General Store Owner:
General Store Owner takes the coinage from Cassie and stuffs it into the wooden drawer that serves as
the register.
"Now, how ta make it inta proper coffee strainer..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"With the lanterns and lantern oil and spikes and rock salt bucks."General Store Owner:
"Standard camping supplies."
Crystal Saint Claire pays the man for the stuff she has
Crystal Saint Claire checkes for that stuff! Camping supplies!
Cassie-May O'Brien meanwhile just lets Crystal browse while she wonders how to make a gold strainer
into a coffeemaker.

And a journal!Crystal Saint Claire:
The promised lanterns are there, as is all manner of oil. The spikes are in a bucket next to
a bunch of rubber mallets. Canvas tents are stacked against the wall. There's a couple boxes of what looks to be
specialty shotgun shells next to the tents.
General Store Owner:
Crystal Saint Claire takes a look!

"Sir, what are these?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Wuss what?"General Store Owner:
Crystal Saint Claire tries to bring him one of the boxes
"Oh, them's rock salt shells."General Store Owner:
"For scaring off prairie ticks and other nonsense you find out in th' wild."
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire plunks two boxes on the counter
Crystal Saint Claire also gets a tent
General Store Owner looks over the boxes of shells and the tent for a few moments. His finger taps the
counter top with a rhythm that seems familiar, probably a song.
"Howsabout, two dollars for the lot?"General Store Owner:
(Note, you guys should be keeping track of your inventory and money exchanged.)
(How many vests could I make from this tent?)Crystal Saint Claire:
(Depends on who you're making it for.)General Store Owner:
(Might be able to get four for a regular sized fella.)
(Two, and maybe a third of a vest for someone of Whitney's size.)

Crystal Saint Claire plunks the tent on the counter.
"And this..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Do you know where I could find someone skilled with gunsmithing?"
General Store Owner holds out a wrinkled hand and rubs his thumb and two fingers together. The
universal sign for 'dosh please.'
"I saw the tent in your hand. Two dollars, as I said."General Store Owner:
"As for gun smithin'..."

"Oh, my apologies!"Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire digs in her carpet bag and pulls out a small canvas sack.
"Vaquero down the street might know something."General Store Owner:
Crystal Saint Claire rummages around
"He's more into firearms than I am."General Store Owner:
Crystal Saint Claire finds 2 dollars, and hands them to the Store Owner.
"And... anyone skilled in metallurgy?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"...a blacksmith."
"I need to find a blacksmith."
"Apologies, I am trying to use simpler words..."
General Store Owner takes the two dollars and slides them into the register.
"I may not be partial to five dollar words, but I do ken the meaning."General Store Owner:
"Thank you sir!"Crystal Saint Claire:
"..."
Crystal Saint Claire looks around for Cassie.
General Store Owner scratches at his chin scruff as he smokes and thinks.
Crystal Saint Claire is considering asking the General Store Owner about any Hucksters in the area...
"Metalworker..."General Store Owner:
Crystal Saint Claire opens the deck of cards in the meanwhile!
"Think there's an Eli Drummond on South street. 'Cross the railroad tracks."General Store Owner:
"Think he does some work fabbin' parts for special orders."
"The Vaquero down the street about guns, Eli Drummond on south street across the tracks
for metals..."
Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire shifts, unable to find Cassie.
"What's eatin' atcha?"General Store Owner:
"I was wondering... if you might know anywhere I could find information about occult
phenomena... For research. Anyone who knows about that sort of thing, or perhaps a library..."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"Dunno 'bout that stuff meself."General Store Owner:
"I'd ask barkeep about it."
"They keep their ears open, and a man talks a lot when he's liquored up to his eyeballs."
"Thank you sir."Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire looks for something to buy to thank the man for his troubles, because just sliding
someone money is sometimes illegal and often insulting

You locate an old hat underneath a pile of belts. It looks to be a collapsible top hat
with...thirteen bullet holes in it.
General Store Owner:
...Crystal Saint Claire:
This is SO COOL
Crystal Saint Claire plops it on the counter
"...may I buy this?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Why are there bullet holes in it?"
"Yes."General Store Owner:
"...it is still a nice hat."Crystal Saint Claire:
bkCassie-May O'Brien:
"I imagine the bullet holes are there because the stupid bastard I won it off had a habit of
getting in duels."
General Store Owner:
"He was a dwarf though."
"Most folks are used to shooting for the guts on a regular sized fella."
"Ah."Crystal Saint Claire:
"How much would you like for it?"
Cassie-May O'Brien just observed with a smirk
General Store Owner holds his chin in a way that makes his wrinkles look almost comically deep.
"Dollar an' ten."General Store Owner:
me nods.Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire nods
"...I do not have change..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire hands him another two dollars.
General Store Owner takes the money and shoves it into the register. He roots around in the drawer for a
minute or two. The General Store Owner comes back with a couple of coins. He drops them onto Crystal's
section of the countertop. Looks to be four dimes and a half dollar.
"Ah think tha's way too much fer a holey top hat, fella."Cassie-May O'Brien:0

Crystal Saint Claire whispers something to Cassie
Cassie-May O'Brien raises her eyebrow
"You wanna play a hand and see how good I am?"General Store Owner:
"Sure!"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Or are yo-"General Store Owner:

General Store Owner scrapes his hand across his face.
"Alright."General Store Owner:
"...I am always up for learning new things! I am not great at poker, the University frowned
upon such things..."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"But my uncle taught me the basics. This hand better than that hand, et cetera..."
"It would be good to learn from someone more skilled than I!"
"Cassie, would you like to play?"
"Right, mind handing me that deck of cards you got?"General Store Owner:
Crystal Saint Claire holds the deck out to the GSO.
"...Eh, sure. Coulda go fer a round.Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Yay!Crystal Saint Claire:
General Store Owner takes the deck and cuts it in half before riffling it back together.
Crystal Saint Claire watches
"This is a new deck, correct?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Should be, seal was still on it."General Store Owner:
"Mind if Ah shuffle it mahself?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"You a huckster?"General Store Owner:
"Faaaaar from it."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I am not a huckster! Should I shufle the cards, as a third party both individuals believe to be
bad at cheating?"
Crystal Saint Claire:
"...that is how it works, is it not?"
"Whoever is worst at cheating shuffles?"
General Store Owner runs his eyeballs over Cassie. He gives the deck of cards to Crystal.

"Go ahead."General Store Owner:
Crystal Saint Claire shuffles. She can't do it quite as fancily, but her hands are steady.
She still has to do it with the cards on the table.Crystal Saint Claire:
"Ah sure like when no one's trustin' each other over them game of cards. Keeps it nice an'
honest."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"You look like you're a weathered cuss."General Store Owner:
"Take it as a compliment."
"Ate bread from many ovens, Ah dun'."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Of course! You can always trust someone who lies to lie to you, so it's jsut as easy as
expecting the truth. Statistically, people who identify as honest are harder to trust, because when they do lie they
ofte get away with it!"
Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire places the shuffled deck on the table.
"The cards are shuffled!"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Would anyone like to do the thing where they pick up half the deck and put the bottom on the top?"
General Store Owner takes the deck and deals cards for Hold 'Em.
"I imagine the decks pretty well shuffled, shouldn't need to cut it."General Store Owner:
Cassie-May O'Brien took a glance at her cards.
"Bettin' anything?"General Store Owner:
"Mmm. Ah wuz wonderin' if we're all playin' jus' fer Crystal's sake here or makin' it
interestin',"
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"What are the stakes? Typically we would play for money..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire takes out a dollar. "Would this be adequate, for a simple, friendly game?"
"I am unfamiliar with gambling etiquette."Crystal Saint Claire:
"That'd be more than ad-eck-wit."General Store Owner:
"Sorry. I will try to stop using expensive words."Crystal Saint Claire:
General Store Owner slides open the register and takes out a dollar to place in the pot.
"No problem with me, but some folks don't take too kindly to it."General Store Owner:
"Miss Doubtful?"
"Ain' got a problem wit' it."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien passes her own dollar onto the table.
"I will try to speak simply, then."Crystal Saint Claire:

"So we... bet, or... check... or raise?"Crystal Saint Claire:

"I will raise."Crystal Saint Claire:

"Did I do something wrong, sir?"Crystal Saint Claire:
Cassie-May O'Brien puts the third dollar down.
"Naw, he's got a crummy hand."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"But he is remaining in."Crystal Saint Claire:

Cassie-May O'Brien leaned over the table, her breasts pressing down and cleavage bulging out from

"Is this where the term "upping the ante" came from?"Crystal Saint Claire:

Righto.General Store Owner:
You can see the belts of ammunition, the pistols, the shotguns, and the rifles from outside. You can
hear some music that sounds like it's being played by a gramophone somewhere deep in the store. You can see
the man at the counter looks like Pancho Villa. What is not certain from the outside is the overpowering odor of
gunpowder, gun oil, and gun metal. It's like a goddam WALL when you open the door.
Gun Runner:
"WELCOME AMIGOS!"
"Sh-"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...Howdy."
"I see you are very fine tasted, very discerning pair of gringos."Gun Runner:
Crystal Saint Claire sighs.
"Before you say anything else."Crystal Saint Claire:

"I don't sell cheese."
"Why would you sell cheese?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Cheese is good."Gun Runner:
"Oh, right! Would you look at my gun?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Keeps long time."Gun Runner:
Crystal Saint Claire is, for a reminder, 15.
Cassie-May O'Brien decides to check if there's brennekas aka slugs for shotgun.
Gun Runner peers down at Crystal from his counter. It has several tiny Mexican flags sticking out of it.
The flagpoles are bullets.
"As long as it is invisible."Gun Runner:
"Or..."
"Not invisible."
"Si."
"It is my bag."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Your bag is a gun?"Gun Runner:
Crystal Saint Claire reaches into the bag really slowly.
"No, the gun is..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Cassie.Gun Runner:
"Oh, here it is!"Crystal Saint Claire:
There are piles and piles of shells.Gun Runner:
Some are in boxes of twenty.
Some are in a glass case with nameplates underneath them.
Cassie-May O'Brien checks if all of those are shot, or any slugs.
There are a good many slugs amongst them.Gun Runner:
Crystal Saint Claire slowly pulls out the gun.
If you want to look for something specific, make a smarts roll.Gun Runner:
"Please be careful. It is not loaded, but one should treat guns like they're loaded unless
you're in a gunfight. Then you treat an empty gun like an empty gun."
Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire looks at the bullets with nameplates!
Nah, just regular shotgun slugs instead of buckshot.Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie gathers up...
"Si, Si, let me take a look at it."Gun Runner:

...20 slugs.Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I made it myself, and was wondering if a professional like you could give me any advice."Crystal Saint Claire:
That should be $2, same as 20 shotshells, yes?Cassie-May O'Brien:
Slugs are a little more specialty than regular shot, but here, two dollars should cover it.Gun Runner:
"I will see what I can see."
"Would Ah git a discount if Ah traded yew sum' of mah buckshot shells fer those?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Some of..."Gun Runner:
Gun Runner looks up from Crystal to Cassie.
"I can give you credit."Gun Runner:
"Long as the shells are good."
"Them are. Whut can Ah git fer 40 of them?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Forty shells of what gauge?"Gun Runner:
"Twelvers."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien pat-patted her double-barrel.
Gun Runner takes the gun from Crystal as he talks to Cassie. He gives it the hairy eyeball from every
angle, pops the cylinder out, touches the metal to his tongue, and hefts it in his palm.
"Can give you two dollar fifty cent in credit."Gun Runner:
"How 'bout we jus' trade forty shotshells fer twenny slugs? Think yer makin' a profit there
anyway."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"You should not lick that, sir"Crystal Saint Claire:
Gun Runner shuffles around behind the counter for a minute before emerging with a box of bullets. He
loads up the cylinder of Crystal's revolver in about ten seconds.
"Fine with me compadre."Gun Runner:
"Keep head away from target for couple of seconds."
Cassie-May O'Brien nods.
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Works fer meh."
Crystal Saint Claire plugs her ears
Cassie-May O'Brien removes 40 shotshells and adds 20 slug shells
Gun Runner holds the pistol up and fires it across the room at a set of metal targets. Behind the targets
are sandbags. Behind the sandbags is a thick oak wall.
The Opus Magnum is a 9-shot revolverCrystal Saint Claire:

Gun Runner picks out the two used cartridges from the gun's cylinder and empties the still good ones
into a pocket on his poncho.
Gun Runner pops in a shotgun shell.
Gun Runner adopts a shooting stance and holds his shooting hand with his free hand.
Gun Runner pops the expended shell out and juggles it in his hand as it cools.
"Everything seems to be in order senorita."Gun Runner:
Gun Runner trots back behind the counter and lays the gun on the table.
"Anything special you want worked on?"Gun Runner:
(Be back in a tick.)

Crystal Saint Claire is looking at the bullets with the nameplates
"I... do have an idea about something."Crystal Saint Claire:
"But it is a bit odd, and still young."
Crystal Saint Claire reaches into her bag and pulls out a little notebook!
"I had the idea talking with a friend."Crystal Saint Claire:
There's a few named after peppers. Jalepeno, Habenro, and Ghost. A couple for really huge guns.
There is also one called, "Tequila Special."
Gun Runner:
"The small, mounted shotgun. With the proper work, could something like that be mounted
on a rifle?"
Crystal Saint Claire:
"Also, what are these?"

Crystal Saint Claire digs in her carpet bag.
Gun Runner taps himself on the head a few times.
"Dollars."Gun Runner:
"Okay!"Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire hands him the money.
"Thank you so much... These will probably save my friends at least once, sir."Crystal Saint Claire:
Gun Runner takes the FAT WAD of cash and shoves it into an iron safe behind the counter.
"You are welcome tiny senorita."Gun Runner:
"...would you mind not telling anyone I came in here?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Well, Cassie will not mind, but"
"If someone learns I have something like the Ghost, my things may go missing..."
Gun Runner takes out a box of fifteen shot, ten shot, and one shot from under the counter.
"Two rules for Ghost."Gun Runner:
"Do not shoot in store."
"Do not shoot in town."
"If want me to keep tight lip about you coming in here..."
Gun Runner rubs two fingers and a thumb together in the universal sign for 'more currency needed.'
"I will not shoot this near any buildings."Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire sighs.
"How much? I have limited funding, at this point."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Five dollar."Gun Runner:

Crystal Saint Claire digs in her bag, placing the boxes of ammo in there.
Crystal Saint Claire gives him five dollars.

Crystal Saint Claire leaves with Cassie, after Cassie gets what she wants.

There is a tiny figure peering in one of the windows. He looks to be wrapped in

The newly minted band of three make their way to the General Store. There is a little
light shining through the windows, but not much. Walking through the door sets off a jingling bell mounted above it.
The tall, lanky store owner turns from where he is examining his stock to face the newcomers. He holds a lit
lantern in one hand and a pad of paper in the other. The pad is covered with neat handwriting. He holds the
lantern up and squints for a second before recognition dawns.

Whitney, you're not sure, but there is something peculiar about this man. Perhaps you should,
touch him. Touch him to be certain he is flesh and blood, not something...else.
(To Yuppie b.):
"Do you know where we would find sewing supplies, Mr. Bean? I am trying to stitch together
a vest for Whitney. Something armored."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"Couple shelves back that way. Should have a lot of bright colored thread spools on the
middle rack. Can't miss it."
General Store Owner:
"Thank you, sir!"Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire scampers off to look.
is Junior shorter than Crystal, or is she still kinda stunted?(From Crystal Saint Claire):
General Store Owner plunks his lantern down onto a nearby rack and scribbles something down on his
paper pad.
Whitney G. Elieen walks forward towards the store owner
Whitney G. Elieen walks forward slowly with her arm stretched outward.
Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit follows Crystal's petticoat tails.

Whitney G. Elieen slowly takes her hand off of his shoulder.

General Store Owner turns back to Whitney.
Crystal Saint Claire finds the stepladder!
"Junior I found the ladder!"Crystal Saint Claire:
"What sort a godbotherer are you?"General Store Owner:
Crystal Saint Claire carries it back to the shelf for thread with some difficulty.
Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit walks around a set of shelves with a peppermint stick held in his bandaged
hand.
"Where did you find that?"Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire climbs up to find thread.
"Whitney what color do you like?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"It was in a jar."Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit:
"Big glass one."
" A follower of the Adventist tradition. A simple missionary of God's will and the church's

Whitney G. Elieen:
"Ah, great! I should purchase a few."Crystal Saint Claire:

"They have green, yellow, blue, red, black, white... What color is this? It's not quite blue, but not green..."
"We are few...but we speak and live true."Whitney G. Elieen:
General Store Owner uses deft fingers to roll up the tobacco in the paper. He gives it a twist to seal it off
and picks up the lantern cover.
"White please. White or...green now that you mention it."Whitney G. Elieen:
"I am fond of green."
"White and green! No problem!"Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal is much less formal speaking with Whitney than anyone else. Am I doing
well in conveying this?

(To Yuppie b.):
Whitney G. Elieen leans back and lets the breath out slowly when she is confident she is free of the
smoke.
"So, howdja meet the kid?"General Store Owner:
"She don't seem like the Adventist type."
"We met on our travels here actually. As the Lord would have it I have been given the chance
to have company on the train."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"A match made in heaven as they say. In the short time we have known one another she has become a fast friend
of mine."
Crystal Saint Claire walks up to the counter, her eyes about level with the flat surface.
Crystal Saint Claire puts the spools on the counter.
"Junior, the other thread?"Crystal Saint Claire:
General Store Owner takes the cigarillo out from betwixt his lips and holds it in his hand. His jaw drops
down and his lips part to fire a ring of smoke off to the left of Whitney's head.
"She's a sweetheart."General Store Owner:
"And, potential, a card shark."
Crystal Saint Claire seems not to realize that they're talking about her.

General Store Owner sticks the cigarillo back in his lips and picks up the lantern. He lopes back on over

Does Junior have a Hankerin/Cravin for Peppermint Sticks?(From Crystal Saint Claire):
He is fond of them, that's about it. He'll be pretty happy if he does get peppermint sticks though.(To Poage):
"What d'ye got for me kid?"General Store Owner:
"Some thread... And possibly peppermint Sticks. Junior likes them, and we're going to be on

General Store Owner trots back out from behind the counter and to the aisle where Crystal was a few
minutes ago. He squints at the array of supplies on the shelves before snatching a leather pouch off the
racks.
"Awright."General Store Owner:
General Store Owner slips behind the counter again and slides the pouch onto the countertop.
"Should be everythin' you need for sewing most anything in there."General Store Owner:
"'Cept the thread."
"That gonna be satisfactory?"
"That will be perfect!"Crystal Saint Claire:
General Store Owner takes a drag on his cigarillo and puffs out a bit more smoke.
"Good, good."General Store Owner:
General Store Owner does some quick arithmetic in his head. He counts out a few numbers on his fingers
and taps on the counter twice.
"Three seventy five alright with you?"General Store Owner:
Crystal Saint Claire thinks.
"Yes, that is fine!"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Then it shall be three seventy five."General Store Owner:
Crystal Saint Claire holds out four dollars.
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"I am fairly sure some of these were yours at some point."
"They will be happy to return to you."
General Store Owner gingerly takes the dollars and shuffles through them. He sticks them into the
wooden drawer of the register and pulls out a quarter.
"Does the money have feelings about who has it or how it's used?"General Store Owner:
You back yet?(To Yuppie b.):
"I like to imagine it does. Sometimes I give them little voices."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Hmmm..."General Store Owner:
General Store Owner taker another pull of his cigarillo. He pulls it out of his mouth and taps the ash off on
the counter's edge.
"Interestin' proposition."General Store Owner:

Whitney's hand reaches out and brushes against Bean's arm as he pushes the

"I am surprised that went as well as it did!"Crystal Saint Claire:
It's uncertain at the moment Whitney. Sleep on it.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Both of you can have a red chip.
Crystal Saint Claire snuggles up to Whitney for warmth
Whitney G. Elieen snuggles right back. Holding her just a little bit tighter and a little bit closer.
Her heart beats like a rabbit's.Crystal Saint Claire:
Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit naps at the foot of the bed.
Whitney G. Elieen squeezes...
Crystal Saint Claire has provided LB with the tent to use for wamth, and a pillow.
"JUST BANG ALREADY." Yells Jesus from heaven.(To Yuppie b.):
Crystal Saint Claire is actively Not Moaning
Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit snoozes happily in his tent on the pillow that is just about his size.
Whitney G. Elieen runs a hand through her hair...
Crystal Saint Claire is NOT GONNA MAKE A NOISE
Crystal Saint Claire is very warm tonight.
Whitney G. Elieen is just as warm and oddly grabby tonight
Crystal Saint Claire doesn't seem to mind... She remains nestled up against the much larger woman like a
stuffed animal.
Crystal Saint Claire is mumbling in her sleep agian.
Whitney G. Elieen holds you tight with the occasional stroke of the hair...seeming especially restless this
evening.
Crystal Saint Claire mumbles something you understand!
"Whtny..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"...lv...yu..."

Stuff about parabolas and ignition temperaturesCrystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire is holding Whitney a little tighter, though.

It's a book reference, and the ignition temp. of paper.(To Poage):
Crystal Saint Claire squirms a little closer to Whitney.
I know THAT, but why are you-- oh , ok(From Crystal Saint Claire):
The whole ingition point thing(From Crystal Saint Claire):
Crystal Saint Claire doesn't do much else, just keeping as close to Whitney as she can.

Two thirds.Doc (GM):
Yuppie will not be joining us today due to extenuating circumstances on her end of
things.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Moon will be back momentarily.
And I have arranged for several surprises.
Kansas city is pretty nice, all things considered. There's good drink, good food, and good company, if you take my
meaning. There is business to attend to though, and after a day to rest from travels, everyone bands together to
head to the main Marshalry Offices.
Alexander Hauswald is waiting, a stoic expression on his face. Sacks is by his side.
Sacks idly scratches his ear.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks terribly excited
"All that travelin' and we're finally here."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Poage is here too
"Guess we are."Alexander Hauswald:
"How'd that poker game go, by the way?Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I had a call o'the, uh..."
"Brown rain."
"Think it mighta had something to do with some old beans."
"...Went too well."Alexander Hauswald:
"...What's that supposed to mean?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Cassie-May O'Brien looked somewhat grouchy. Perhaps the reason was her not drinking coffee at the
moment, even though at this point she constantly smelled of it.
"...Very long story."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald looks around, and examines something in his pocket.
"Maybe we can play some time! I learned from Mr. Bean at the general store!"Crystal Saint Claire:
"I should play with more people to improve..."
"...Mr. Bean?"Alexander Hauswald:
"He owns the store."Crystal Saint Claire:
"...Mr. Bean?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...Think I played with him."Alexander Hauswald:
Big Bawss Bandit has irons on his arms and legs and is walking along with the rest of the party. He
grumbles something on occasion.
"He taught me poker... and I may have accidentally won twenty dollars."Crystal Saint Claire:

"Y'all, never play poker wit' Crystal 'ere."Cassie-May O'Brien:
is the kid here?(From Crystal Saint Claire):
"...Reminds me."Alexander Hauswald:
"...Then again, Ah never woulda pay tha' much fer a steak mahself, howerver darn good it
wuz."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"And of you know something about coins?"Alexander Hauswald:
Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit walks along behind the larger bandit with his colt's stock at his shoulder.
Crystal Saint Claire moves back to talk with the two of them.
"So."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Should I go over the general plan again?"
"...Guess that's nobody."Alexander Hauswald:
Big Bawss Bandit stares at Crystal with his one...sort of good eye. It is hard to tell the quality of it since it
appears to be red and not made entirely out of flesh.
"Nothin bout coins here."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Take em to a banker, maybe?"
"They got a bank in town, I bet."
"...Uh..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Don't think I can."Alexander Hauswald:
Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit perks up and peers up to Crystal's face from the ground as he walks.
"Huckster stuff."Alexander Hauswald:
"I'll take your word for it."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"We're takin these fellas in for the bounty, right?"
"Junior, try to stick with your father as long as you can. I am sure the two of you have much
to-- EXCUSE ME LONGIRON"
Crystal Saint Claire:
"Whut?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Crystal Saint Claire sounds pissed.
"...Since when them's two?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien stared at the bandits
"..."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald looks at the bandits, and then at Sacks.
"We are not 'taking in' a TEN-YEAR-OLD for a BOUNTY."Crystal Saint Claire:
"What's the problem?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"...Why do we have a ten year old bandit here."Alexander Hauswald:
"He is not..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"He is not a bandit."
"Eeeyup, whut in tarnation dun' happen?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"He is my bodyguard."Crystal Saint Claire:
"I'm not?"Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit:
"Where'd th' kid come from?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Oh, right."Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit:
"He is the son of the man in the leg irons"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Aw, look. Crystal made a friend."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I came from dad's camp when he didn't come home the other night."Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit:
"Whom I will be attempting to deputize."Crystal Saint Claire:
"..."Alexander Hauswald:
"Awrigh, but where did he dun' come from!?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Alexander Hauswald looks at Crystal.
"...You got a bandit's kid following you around."Alexander Hauswald:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano pokes Alex lightly.
"Ssssh. Just let her have this."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"The way I see it, he managed to succeed as a bandit for a while."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Why do you-"Alexander Hauswald:
"I don't think she's ever had a friend before" He whispers.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Alexander Hauswald looks at Nephi.
Alexander Hauswald rolls his eyes
"That means he knows how bandits think, how they work. That makes him an asset, if he is
willing to work with us, and provides him a source of income he can use to provide for his family without resorting
to banditry."
Crystal Saint Claire:
Big Bawss Bandit grumbles something unpleasant sounding.
*"But where did y'all git him from!? Ah sure as sugar donCassie-May O'Brien:
Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit jabs the bigger bandit in the knee.
remember him bein' there on th' train!?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...Don't think about it, Cass."Alexander Hauswald:

"Just don't."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano shrugs
"But Ah-"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...Am Ah really th' only un' concerned by this?"
"No."Alexander Hauswald:
"No. But I know that Crystal's going to throw a fit if we disagree and ah don't want to
deal with that right now."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"But thinking only makes it worse."Alexander Hauswald:
Sacks sniffs the little boy.
Ah, there they are. Big wooden building with a shiny star hanging off the front. There
are a set of double doors just waiting to be opened.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit smells like peppermint, for some reason.
What's the protocol for entering the office of a bunch of lawmen, and women, again?Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Knock on the door?
Alexander Hauswald just knocks on the damn door.
Shoot the lock off and kick the door down to establish dominance?Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Sacks wags his tail!
Cassie-May O'Brien stared at the assembled posse with a complicated expression on her face. Mostly
bewilderment.
"Bark bark!"Sacks:
"...But Ah j- ye know whut, fuck it. Whutever. Ah ain' drunk enough fer this."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Just as Andrew's hand is about to make contact with wood, the door swings open.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"Oh."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Behind it is a red headed woman in a green dress.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano blinks
"Helloooooo~"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Hello, you must be the ones Mister Fossifer sent for."Secretary:
Alexander Hauswald nods and pulls out his letter.
"We sure are!"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"That's us."Alexander Hauswald:
"Come in, come in."Secretary:
"Yess ma'am."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"I'm sure you've got lots of questions and we've got lots of answers."Secretary:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano tips his hat to the lady and follows in behind the others
"Not all of them, but some."Secretary:
Secretary steps aside and waves you into the offices with a flourish.
"Pretty empty for such a big place."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Can everyone see and move?Wonderful Cowboy Land:
YepNephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...Waste of space."Alexander Hauswald:
(Yep)Poage:
Alexander starts fucking running around the room to prove his point.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"Figger it's built for more folks than are currently occupying, right?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Correct..."Secretary:
"That seems likely."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Most likely."Alexander Hauswald:
"We've been having, a little trouble as of late."Secretary:
"tha's a huge office..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"..."
Secretary walks forward towards the desk at the back of the room.
"...Tha's a dead man at th' desk."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"We are here to speak with..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"What should we do with the ah..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Crystal Saint Claire digs through her bag for the letter.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano jerks a thumb back towards the big bandit.
"... Looks like Deadman got here first."Alexander Hauswald:
"Marshall... the rest of it is covered by a stain."Crystal Saint Claire:
Wily Galen is scribbling something down onto a piece of paper with the nub of a pencil.
Sacks 's ears droop at the sight of the walking talking corpse.
"...Right. Welp, no time like the present."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Good to know you guys are just as polite as the last time."Wily Galen:
"Sorry."Alexander Hauswald:

https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 223/791
Alexander Hauswald shrugs.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano pointedly ignores the dead man.
"Sacks doesn't like you."Alexander Hauswald:
"Nothing personal."
"Are the rest of you coming?"Secretary:
"C'mon folks!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Crystal Saint Claire waves to Garen!
"Hello!"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Don't be shy."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Come along. We will most likely remain in the back, while the others talk..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Wily Galen waves back, then resumes scribbling on his pad.
"And then we try to figure out how this will work!"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Marshal Fossifer?"Secretary:
("Dear diary, my pencil is not working. Love, Galen.")Alexander Hauswald:
((Also gimme a sec, nature called))
Secretary walks forward a few steps and taps her heel against the desk.
"THAT was his name. Fossifer!"Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire steps forward.
Crystal Saint Claire scribbles something down in her little lab hournal
Overmarshal Fossifer pops up from where he was bending over in his chair and looks up to see the
visitors in his office. He rubs a hand over his dark skinned face and blinks a few times.
"...Howdy?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Alexander Hauswald just nods at the man.
"Sorry, late night."Overmarshal Fossifer:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano bows his head and removes his hat.
"Greetins!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Overmarshal Fossifer takes a moment to run his eyes over the group. The marshal's eyes get a little bit
wider when he sees the two bandits. His left hand slides open a drawer in his desk and pulls a book out.
Crystal Saint Claire nods.
"Hello."Crystal Saint Claire:
"I take it all of you got your letters and made it here with..."Overmarshal Fossifer:

Crystal Saint Claire is shaking a little, but places herself directly between the Marshall and the bandits.
"Not going to say no difficulty."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Only minor difficulty."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Good, good."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Could've been worse."Alexander Hauswald:
"Coulda been way worse."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Lil' problems."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"But hey, no better way to prove we know our stuff, right?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Big Bawss Bandit bristles a little, but is otherwise silent.

"Right you are."Overmarshal Fossifer:

"Well, allow me to welcome all of you to Kansas city."Overmarshal Fossifer:

"Is what is left of the main Marshalry offices."
"...What's left?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Lookin' minda empteh."Cassie-May O'Brien:

Crystal Saint Claire turns to Bawss.
"You were quite terrifying, honestly."Crystal Saint Claire:
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers looks at the Bawss. "This y'all's doin'?"
"It used to be full, before my marshals started dropping faster than flies on poisoned
horseshit."
Overmarshal Fossifer:
Big Bawss Bandit shakes his head after a few moments of contemplation.
"...Not something you tell to new candidates."Alexander Hauswald:
"You want me to lie to you?"Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Keep you in the dark and treat you like mushroom?"
Alexander Hauswald shrugs.

"But that's not it."
"Just what someone wants it to look like."
"...Assassinations?"Alexander Hauswald:
"...Well that ain't good news."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Mmmmm..."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"How d'ya figure?"Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
Overmarshal Fossifer rubs at his chin for a few moments.
Crystal Saint Claire sits back in a chair to listen.
"Some of them, probably, some of them just bandits with better shooting, better guns than
they any right to."
Overmarshal Fossifer:
Cassie-May O'Brien takes example from Crystal - she steps over to the desk, kicks the chair to turn it, and
sits down.
Crystal Saint Claire is writing stuff down in her book, on a fresh page..
Alexander Hauswald just stays standing.
"So, why us?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Can I get a page for Crystal(From Crystal Saint Claire):
"Y'all dun' ask fer us specifically."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"She has a point."Alexander Hauswald:
Titled "Conspiracies."(From Crystal Saint Claire):
"I am curious how my name even reached your ears. I have tried to be... subtle."Crystal Saint Claire:
Cassie, the chair squeaks as you sit down in it. You feel a little shock. It passes before
a second is over.

Overmarshal Fossifer squints and taps his desk five times.
"Go ahead, you can say it. You didn't ask for those two."Crystal Saint Claire:
"No, I sent letters to six."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Only five of you."
"...Also, Whitney is not here at the moment."Crystal Saint Claire:
"She will be here."
"Ah."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Ah wuz wonderin' where's she."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"She was sick this morning."Crystal Saint Claire:

Cassie-May O'Brien wiggled in the chair, confused.
"I hope it is nothing..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Let's hope."Alexander Hauswald:
"She is strong. She will overcome."Crystal Saint Claire:
"As for why and how I know about each of you, mostly by reputation."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Miss Cassie I heard about from Pony Express."
Overmarshal Fossifer turns to regard Cassie for a moment.
Overmarshal Fossifer smiles an odd little smile.
"Yes, Pony Express."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Very good, retired from job not in a pine box."
(Goddammit. Applejack was heard about from Pony Express. GG.)Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
(Oh, NOOOOO)Crystal Saint Claire:

"Heard about Hauswald from old townsfolk."Overmarshal Fossifer:
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers blinks and then shakes her head. "Ah need ta quit drinkin' rotgut..."
(Okay that's far enough)Crystal Saint Claire:
"Went looking around to see what had happened there."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Nothing good."
Alexander Hauswald remains stoic, looking at Fossifer.
"...Hurm."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...Yer name's Hauswald?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Secretary clicks forward in her raised heel half boots. She tops in front of Alexander and bends down to
Sacks' level. She holds out a hand.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano says, looking to Alex.
Alexander Hauswald nods.
"Huh."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Sacks sniffs the girl's hand. Before looking up at her and wagging his tail.
Secretary smiles at the little dog and scratches his floppy ears for him.
Sacks barks happily!
"Bark bark!"Sacks:
(I like to imagine that Sacks just says "bark" at some point, like he's given up on trying to
convince anyone.)
Crystal Saint Claire:
"Miss Crystal, I heard about from a few professors, and her uncle."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Worried."
(("Shit, she's on to me"))Sacks:
"...how do you know Uncle Ichabod?"Crystal Saint Claire:
((...Okay when is Crystal making him a dog-to-English translator))Sacks:
((When I get a Royal goddamn flush on the draw.))Crystal Saint Claire:
"That one is, partially, my fault."Secretary:
"Expound."Crystal Saint Claire:
"...Ah'm thinkin' ol' Overmarshall 'ere knows lot more he shows..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Secretary stands up straight again and walks over to her desk to fiddle with the drawers.
"Course he does."UrbanCritter:
Crystal Saint Claire has not looked up from her writing, and only moves if it is obvious the Secretary
needs her to.

"I keep up with the scientific community as one of my hobbies, and I heard about an exceptional young
graduate from MIT."
Secretary:
"Oh, you have interests in science?"Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire perks up a little.
"Any fields in particular?"Crystal Saint Claire:
Secretary pulls out a small, round, corn bread looking ball. She takes a sniff of it and looks satisfied.
Crystal Saint Claire looks at the ball.
"What is that?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"I have a degree in Civil Engineering, but Physics has always been my favorite subject."Secretary:
"Oh, this?"
"It's a hush puppy."
Sacks perks up at the word "puppy".
"...do you have more food in here?"Crystal Saint Claire:
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers 's eyes start to glaze over until she hears the words 'hush puppy."
"If so, may I have some? I... slept through breakfast this morning."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Of course."Secretary:
"...Y'all got hush puppies?"Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"On both counts."Secretary:
"...on all counts."
Crystal Saint Claire makes a note in her book: "Snack bag"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano rubs his temples.
"I'm not hungry. Sacks is, though."Alexander Hauswald:
Secretary clicks back over to Alex and Sacks. She bends down and offers the hush puppy to the little dog.
"We should get back to doing things."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Why specifically us, I believe we were asking?"
"I understand them... But adding in myself, I cannot see us as a "Posse," so to speak."
"Each for different reasons."Overmarshal Fossifer:
Sacks gently grabs it with his teeth, putting it on the ground, and licking the nice lady.
"List 'em?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Sacks then starts eating.
"But all, because it seemed to me you are all concerned with doing good."Overmarshal Fossifer:

I mean, it's going to take him a while to chew. So yes.(To Poage):
"Strange, though."Alexander Hauswald:
"We're not the best out there."
"I know I'm not."
"Of course not. The best are likely overpriced."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Or on the 'other teams' as it were."
"Best?"Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Concern with..."
Overmarshal Fossifer rubs two fingers and a thumb together in the age old gesture of, "Munnay."
"Fair enough."Alexander Hauswald:
"Don't need folk too concerned wit greenbacks."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Need folk concerned wit helping."
"That don't mean I ain't gonna pay you."
"Just gotta have..."
Overmarshal Fossifer runs his fingers over the oiled cylinder of the gun on his desk as he searches for a
word.
"Right pri-or-ee-tee."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Huh."Cassie-May O'Brien:

"I will."Crystal Saint Claire:
Overmarshal Fossifer scoots his chair back from his desk and walks over to the desk Cassie is sitting at.
His coat has a lot of tassels with bright orange and yellow beads. The tassels click together as he walks
with a pleasant sussuration.
"Also, I have questions regarding... these two."Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire points to Bawws and Junior.
Overmarshal Fossifer jimmies one of the larger drawers open and pulls out a small leather bound book.
Some of the pages are a little yellow.
"Mmmm..."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"The main question being, may I deputize the larger one?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"No."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Taking him in."
Crystal Saint Claire sighs.
"What are your plans for him?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Stand trial."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Or..."
Overmarshal Fossifer tucks the books under his arm and walks forward to look at Big.
"Is there anything I could do to convince whomever will be handing out the verdict that he is
potentially a valuable asset to the law, and a victim of circumstance?"
Crystal Saint Claire:
Overmarshal Fossifer doesn't say anything, he puts a hand on Big's neck and feels around for something.
His hand pauses over a certain spot his neck. Fossifer's index finger taps something, then traces around
Big's neck to his eye.
"Hmmm..."Overmarshal Fossifer:
I'm back. Has the mission begun yet?Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
(Not yet)Crystal Saint Claire:
"I was wondering... about that."
"Seen some of it recent."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Not right."

"Been meaning to investigate."
"He can help."
"No trial, for now."
"Help how?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Tell where he got eye, maybe something else."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Be safe with me."
Big Bawss Bandit reaches up and moves the Marshall's hand away from his face.
Crystal Saint Claire walks up to BB.
"Do these terms sound agreeable?"Crystal Saint Claire:
Big Bawss Bandit turns and looks to Junior for a moment. The smaller bandage covered individual nods
and pats Big on the leg with affectionate reassurance. Big turns back around and nods.
"I'll help."Big Bawss Bandit:
"Good."Overmarshal Fossifer:
Overmarshal Fossifer walks back over to his desk and pulls out a small box. The box jingles as he places
it on the level wood plain of the desk.
"Then I will agree to the terms of employment as well."Crystal Saint Claire:
Overmarshal Fossifer sets the journal down on the desk with one hand while he opens the box. He takes
out a small stack of money, thinks for a moment, then puts another stack on top of it.
Overmarshal Fossifer closes up the box and chucks it back under his desk.
"Hundred dollars for supplies and horses, fifty for the notorious Big Bawws, and record of
cases Billy was working on."
Overmarshal Fossifer:
Crystal Saint Claire takes the record.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has been getting bored of all the listening, and decides to spend his time
looking out of the window.

Nephi makes it over the fence with style. The rickety construction wobbles under his
weight, but he is both scrawny and careful about where he applies what little force he has.

Two of the bullets kick up clods of dirt around the tumbleweed. The third hits it. The
bullet slices through the weed and sends red splashing onto the ground. The weed jerks, rolls five, twenty feet,
and stops.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano turns to look towards the speaker.
Little Girl stands behind Nephi. The right leg of her dress is torn. Her legs is bleeding. So is her arm. She
is cradling a small furry creature in her arms that makes a mewling noise every few seconds.

"...That's a cat, huh?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Yes, he is."Little Girl:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano takes a look
Little Girl continues to hold the mass of fur to her chest. Nephi can see as he gets closer, the girl's arm is
not bleeding. The cat is. There are dozens of puncture wounds across the feline's body and no small
amount of blood on the girl's dress. He needs a veterinarian quick, or he will die.

Anyway.
Cassie-May's scene.
Also, something that will likely be relevant.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
The missing marshal's name is Billy.
It has been a long day Cassie. You've been trying to watch our for everyone and make sure the small bandit still
with you doesn't get up to any funny business. The only thing that seems to hold his interest for longer than two
seconds is peppermint sticks, shooting, and Whitney. Not sure if the little fella is actually interested in her sermons
or the...holy sacraments inside her dress. Not too bad really, or at least no worse than Nephi. The big fella got
dropped off at the marshal's office, so he's out of your hair now. Time to lay down and, sleep.
Cassie-May O'Brien was NOT happy about the sleeping part. She avoided sleep as long as she could, but
she realized her body needed the rest. It's a shame it was no rest for her mind and poor soul.
Cassie-May O'Brien made the sign of the cross and, taking a sigh like a trooper about to go over the
trench, flopped on the bed.
(Forgot to hand those out last session, and you might need them for this.)Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Aye aye, added to sheet.Cassie-May O'Brien:
This should be simple. Close your eyes. Don't think of anything. Sleep should come
soon. All it takes is waiting and not thinking of what might be lurking in the blackness.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Son of a bitch.
It's itching again.
The spot on your hand.
Cassie-May O'Brien rubbed her palm with a groan, clenching her jaw.
You can hear the whispers.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Like always.
But, something a little different this time.

"N-nnnrrrrgh..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien trashed in the bed. What was that... What was that voice saying...?
The harder you listen the more you feel like something is tugging at your chest.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Cassie-May O'Brien weakly pawed at her chest in her sleep.
There's something there.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
An old hand, weathered by work, time, and sun.
A familiar hand.
"N-no..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien turned her head, as if trying to see it in her sleep.
There's something else in the bed with you. Little round things that clack together as
you roll.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
They are warm.
Some warmer than others.
"Whuu..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien turned her head in her sleep, trying to see with closed eyes.
The hand is there. You can see a brown palm. The palm shares your mark. It brushes
against the discs. They shine with a wan luminescence. There are five ones that shine white. Five that shine red.
One that shines blue.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Cassie-May O'Brien tries to grab the palm!
Cassie's hand wraps around the palm.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
You can feel the tugging get stronger, pulling at your chest even harder than before, but there is no resolution, not
yet. The palm is cold. Perhaps it could use, a little warming up?
Cassie-May O'Brien put her other hand on the unfamiliar-yet-famliar palm and ran her fingers over it in
confusion. She has always had warm hands.
Her other hand makes the palm no warmer. It bend down and brushes against the
gently glowing discs.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
*bends
"..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien let go with one hand, and extended it to the discs. What were those...? That hand
seemed to... want them? Should she give one up...?
The fingers of the palm point to two of the white discs. It gets close, but does not
touch them. Then it returns to the position it held before.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Cassie-May O'Brien was confused... this was nothing like her usual nightmares. It was so...
Cassie-May O'Brien grabbed one of the white discs in her hand.
The palm curls its fingers inward in a gesture of beckoning.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
1/20/2018 Chat Log for Wonderful Cowboy Adventure Land
https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 243/791
Cassie-May O'Brien moved her lips silently. There was something...
"..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...."
"...w..hy?"
The palm makes no reply.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
It waits.
Cassie-May O'Brien was torn. Ain't nothing in life for free, Dad said. But...
"..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien put the one white disc in the cold palm.
The palm accepts the disc. It holds it for a moment, testing it maybe. It bounces the
disc in its palm twice. It did touch two of them.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien grabbed the other white disc. Ah, what the hell. If this was all it took... this was so
much better than her normal nightmares. Another white disc was sacrificed to the palm.
The palm accepts the second disc.The fingers curl closed and the palm becomes a
fist for a moment. It squeezes. When it opens again, the discs are gone. It reaches forward and gently takes
Cassie's arm.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Then it yanks her with the force of a cannon blast into blackness so dark that her eyes might as well be gone.
"!!!"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie travels through the darkness for some time. She can't tell if the palm is there
any longer, only tenebrous black remains.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Then.
Cassie realizes that the black is no longer the same.
It feels like the black of being in a room with no light, instead of being in...whatever she was before.
Cassie-May O'Brien reached out, feeling for... anything, really.
Aches and pains emerge. Strange ones that correspond to nothing that Cassie has
felt before. Alien sensations probing into her consciousness from some peculiar body.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
The ground shifts.
Cloth moves.
Rustling of papers.
The rasp of a match, and finally some goddamn light.
(Can you see?)
(I can now)Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien took a shaky step forward.
Cassie-May O'Brien then another. And another.
A wall.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
1/20/2018 Chat Log for Wonderful Cowboy Adventure Land
https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 244/791
Dirty, and peculiar.
Cassie-May O'Brien moved along it, hand on the wall.
The wall seems to stop and give way to...the blackness of dreams.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
It would not be a good idea to go beyond it, yet.
"..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
The ragged shoes on Cassie's alien body slosh through blood.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Cassie-May O'Brien knelt down. A body...?
It is sticky, and coagulated, but not yet totally dry.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
A man.
Well dressed, but very much dead.
There is a shining pistol in his hand, and something strange over his left eye.
It almost looks like a stove element.
Cassie-May O'Brien examines that weird something.
On closer inspection, it seems to be a red light with a protective metal casing. It
extends out of the man's socket an inch.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
There does not seem to be an eye underneath it.
Cassie-May O'Brien pulls it out
It resists at first, but the hands of this odd body are strong, despite their decrepit look.
The contraption slides out of the man's socket with five good tugs.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
There are several...wires hanging off it.
Cassie-May O'Brien stares at the contraption, dumbfounded.
Some are obviously copper, some look like viscera, and some shine oddly in the light
of the cigarette between the Smoker's teeth.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
This is not something that should have been built.
Not something that any god fearing man would create.
It screams Mad Scientist.
Cassie-May O'Brien inspects the eye hole with the decrepit fingers of the other hand of this weird body.
Joints creak as Cassie makes the Smoker's body bend down and investigate the dead
man's eye socket.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
The device seems to have taken up the space of...about three fourths of an index finger.
"..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Then there's some mangled bits of squishy meat that Cassie takes to be brain.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Cassie-May O'Brien pats the corpse down, curious for other weird contraptions.
There are bullets in one of the suit pockets. They are slick with partially dried blood.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Cassie-May O'Brien takes those. What caliber?
1/20/2018 Chat Log for Wonderful Cowboy Adventure Land
https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 245/791
The Smoker's hand transfers the bullets to his coat pocket. It holds up one for closer
inspection. Looks to be a forty-four. It has an odd engraving of a...bird on the side.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Cassie-May O'Brien looks for the reason for the corpse's demise.
There's two holes in the pants leg of the corpse, and one in the upper chest.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Judging by the blood trail, the poor bastard might have been alive enough to crawl over here before bleeding out.
Cassie-May O'Brien pocketed the weird device and patted the corpse's pockets again to make sure, then
stood up.
The Smoker's body moves at Cassie's command. There's the tap of something
against the chest of the Smoker as he stands. Cassie can barely feel it amidst the aches, pains, and popping
joints, but it is there.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Cassie-May O'Brien glanced down and put her - his? - hand there, curious and confused.
Ah, a shoulder rig. Leather one.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
There's a pistol in the holster.
Cassie-May O'Brien pulls out the gun.
It is a heavy piece. Revolving cylinder, feels like a double action. Got an octagonal
barrel and a good grip. It feels right in the Smoker's hand, like a handshake from an old friend.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien checks the chamber.
The chamber is full. It takes six bullets. Four of them look to be spent.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien checks the corpse for holes again. Three wounds, yes?
Three, two in the leg, one in the upper chest.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Cassie-May O'Brien assumed she was the shooter.
Cassie-May O'Brien came to where the blood trail started and knelt down again, feeling the ground for a...
hole? The bullet?
There's nothing to find, save for the blood and a depression in the ground where the
Smoker laid.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
". . ."
Cassie-May O'Brien checks for wounds on own body.
Cassie-May O'Brien in places the corpse was wounded.
There's nothing on the Smoker's legs, but there is a hole in his gut. His left cheek has
a furrow carved into it.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"..."Cassie-May O'Brien:

Cassie-May O'Brien pulled the contraption from the corpse's eye out again with his/her left hand, and the
gun with the right.

BackWonderful Cowboy Land:
Smoker starts easing the trigger back. It gets fully cocked and the hammer snaps forward, but there is no
bang.
Smoker thumbs stopped the hammer before it could hit.
Smoker frowns.
"I don't remember doing that."Smoker:
Something else is waking up Cassie, and it's pushing you.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"Mmmnnnngh...?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Smoker reaches up to the cigarette between his teeth, and snuffs it.
Back to black.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Cassie, you feel right again.
There's bedsheets around you, covered in cold sweat.
Cassie-May O'Brien groaned. Is it morning again...? Was that enough sleep for her body..?"
There is a light, but it doesn't feel bright enough to be the sun coming through the
window.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Cassie-May O'Brien felt around. This... was better than her usual nightmares.
There's a lantern burning on the nightstand. A bottle of whiskey sits next to it. The
bottle still has frost clinging to the outside.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Cassie-May O'Brien grabbed the bottle.
Cool to the touch.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Cassie-May O'Brien pulled it over amd took a gulp.
The whiskey rolls down Cassie's throat with a smooth, icy burn. It feels good. Takes a
little bit of the edge off.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"...Ffffuck."Cassie-May O'Brien:
The night goes on.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
(There you go.)

Love the new splash.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
I sure do wish I could see itUrbanCritter:
But yeah, let's be heroes and save a little girl's kitty catAlexander Hauswald:
Nephi and the injured girl carrying her far more injured cat catch Alexander as he's
coming out of the marshalry. Sacks is following along behind him. Sacks is always following along behind Alex.
The little girl has been possessed with a peculiar calm the entire time. Having a beloved pet on the brink of death
normally provokes more tears and less stoic determination.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"..."Alexander Hauswald:

Alexander Hauswald pauses in his tracks, examining the girl and Nephi, and noticing the cat.
""... What'd you do?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Nothin!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...Well, okay, I shot a thing."
"But not this thing!"
(BRB real quick one second need to do a thing)
"He told me that we were going to someone who could help Grimmie."Little Girl:
"... Suppose that's me. Let me have a look at him."Alexander Hauswald:
"...Not here, though. Hang on. I got a room by the salloon whete it's cleaner."
"If you think Grimmie will last that long."Little Girl:
Little Girl hugs the matted ball of fur close to her bloodied chest.
"I can't fix him with my bare hands. Come on. Let's hurry."Alexander Hauswald:
Little Girl follows Alexander. She glances at Sacks a few times on the way, but the glances grow less
frequent after she is sure he is not going to do anything to her cat.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano follows
Sacks just stares at her, before following his master.
((skip to like, two minutes later when they reach his room?Alexander Hauswald:
The party reaches the saloon. No one blinks as they bring a girl with blood dripping
down her dress with them. The bartender does indicate that they should stay away from the rugs though.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Alexander Hauswald kicks the door to his room open and moves everything from a nearby table.
"Put him on the table. Nephi, go down and get a bottle of something strong."Alexander Hauswald:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano does exactly that and...
"Uh."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Alex."
"How will I know which one's strong?"
"You ask the bartender. Tell him I need it as disinfectant.Alexander Hauswald:
"...I don't- Got it."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads down and rushes in the general direction of the bartender.
Alexander Hauswald reaches for his suitcase, pulling out a set of tools and setting them carefully.
"when's thr last time Grimmie ate?"Alexander Hauswald:
Little Girl sets her cat on the table. She keeps pressure on the area that has the most puncture wounds,
but the cat still oozes blood onto the tabletop.
"This morning."Little Girl:

https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 249/791
"About five hours ago."
Alexander Hauswald takes a rag and a bottle of chloroform.
"Good. Means we can sedate him."Alexander Hauswald:
Bartender is waxing his mustache when Nephi comes back down the stairs.
"Hmm?"Bartender:
Alexander Hauswald gently presses the now-wet rag against the cat's face, gently making sure he's not
causing any more damage.
"Alex needs some disinfectant!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...Gimme the most alchol-y alcohol you got that alcohols."
The cat breathes in the chloroform for a few minutes. Then his breathing get a little
more shallow.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"Alright. We can operate."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald tries to check the damage, looking at the door.
Bartender stares at Nephi for about five seconds before putting away his mustache wax tin. He bends
down and rummages underneath the bar, then slams a jar of clear liquid onto the countertop.
"Dollar."Bartender:
"Nephi, hurry up!"Alexander Hauswald:
There is no wound that is overly terrifying. Each one is about as bad as getting a
fishook ripped out, but there are a lot of them, centered around the cat's belly.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"...These aren't as bad as I thought. There's just a lot of them."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald turns to the girl.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano slams down a dollar from his pocket
"I thought Nephi shot him."Alexander Hauswald:
Bartender takes the dollar.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano grabs the jar as soon as it's offered then runs his ass upstaris
"It was a not tumbleweed."Little Girl:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano bursts through the door like a man possessed.
"ALEX! Hah-hur-hurf, just... One sec-"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...I know the kind-"Alexander Hauswald:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano holds out the jar
Alexander Hauswald grabs the jar, opens it, and takes a tentative sniff.
"I gotta-hurfotta... Oof."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"... This'll do. This'll do fine."Alexander Hauswald:
"Cost me a dollar so it darn well better... HURF."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Alright, ah'm good now."
"You must not run a lot."Little Girl:
"Not like that, no!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Alright. Most of these aren't bad. We could get away with cleaning and bandaging them. A
few are gonna need a stitch."
Alexander Hauswald:
It's time to roll.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Alexander Hauswald sets the jar of livercide on the table, gently using it to wet another rag and clean a
needle from his toolset, before gently dabbing at the wounds. With the alcohol rag. He doesn't expect to
cringe the germs away.

Did we save the catte?UrbanCritter:
Alexander manages to get the cat's wounds under control with a liberal use of plasters
and stitches on the wider holes. The bleeding is slowed significantly after he finishes. Within five minutes there is
only an occasional drop of blood that seeps out. The cat's breath is still shallow, but it is stable.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
UrbanCritter wipes his brow, sighing.
Little Girl looks down at the patchwork kitty. She sighs and the tension in her body eases.
"Thank you."Little Girl:
"...Good work, Alex."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
""He'll live."UrbanCritter:
"Now, listen. Don't let him get out of your sight until he gets better. He WILL try to pick on the stitches and
bandaging."
Your name's wrongNephi "Longiron" Delano:
"And try to keep his diet light. As liquid as possible for the next few days."Alexander Hauswald:
"Overall, he should be fine."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has found a nearby chair and sat himself down in it.
Little Girl nods as Alex dispenses medicinal wisdom. She reaches out a hand and rests it against the cat's
head.
"...Y'know you never introduced yourself, little missy."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"You never asked for my name, and a gentleman is supposed to make the first move."Little Girl:
"A-"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...Well alright ya got me there."
"If everything's alright, come in about two weeks so we could get the stitches out."Alexander Hauswald:
"You don't seem like much of a gentleman though."Little Girl:
Alexander Hauswald looks at the little scene, the barest hint of a smile on his face.
"A-hey! Ah'll have you know I'm a spittin'image of a right gentleman."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Is that why you have all those guns?"Little Girl:
"...M'workin through some things."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Gentlemen carry guns."
"They carry guns on their hip, sometimes."Little Girl:
"Not rifles."
"...I got bigger things to shoot."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Real nasty things. Things little ladies shouldn't hafta worry about."
"Things so scary you'd go runnin home to momma."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano stands up and heads for the room's little window, looking out of it towards the
horizon.
Alexander Hauswald just cleans his hands and starts packing, his back turned to them as he fights the
urge to laugh.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano doesn't seem well at ease until he's done this.
Little Girl stands there with blood down the front of her dress and a slight frown on her face.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano eventually seems satisfied with what he sees out there.
"Now, c'mon. Let's get you cleaned up."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"M'sure we can find a bucket somewhere round here."
"I'm sure that I can clean myself just fine when I want to."Little Girl:

Little Girl takes the cat with gentle hands and cradles him against her chest.
"I will."Little Girl:
"...You got a home to go back to, lil'missy?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Yes."Little Girl:
Little Girl scuffs her feet on the wood floor for a moment.
"I do."Little Girl:

Alexander Hauswald nods.
"It's past the tracks. On the other side of the foundry."Little Girl:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano returns with his duster coat slung over one shoulder.
"Le me pack up and we'll be on our way."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald starts packing up, putting the jar of theoretically-alcohol on the shelf.
Sacks was remarkably silent all this time.
"Ready to mosey on outta here, Alex?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Let's go."Alexander Hauswald:
Little Girl walks forward with the cat, careful to maintain a good grip on him.
Bartender watches as the party leaves the saloon. His mustache is now waxed. It looks luxuriant.
Alexander Hauswald nods at the bartender knowingly.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano just carries on.
Bartender does not change his expression in the slightest. He does pick up a glass and begin to polish it
with a stained white cloth.
I gotta goNephi "Longiron" Delano:
I'll be back.
"... Haven't asked. What's your name, kid?"Alexander Hauswald:
(seeya
"Tessa."Little Girl:
The little girl leads Nephi and Alexander through a twisting complex of alleyways and fences. It is difficult to know
exactly where they are. The three of them come to a door.
Little Girl pulls a key out of the pockets of her dress. It shines in the dusk light.
"Alexander."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald just patiently waits.
Little Girl walks up the little set of steps to the door and inserts the key into the lock below the handle.
She twists. Something inside the lock clicks. Tessa pushes the door open.
Alexander Hauswald remains stationary- he wasn't invited in. It's basic manners, really.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano does the same.
"You can come in if you want."Tessa:
Tessa takes the key out of the lock with one hand and tucks it back into a pocket of her dress. It
squelches a little. Probably all the blood.
Alexander Hauswald takes a look around before following the girl, wiping his boots before he enters and
closing the door after him.
I'm going to assume he lets Nephi get in as well.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Cause it would be a dick move to just shut the door in his face.

Let's assume.Alexander Hauswald:
The interior of the place is nice. Wood floor with a long rug on it. There are rooms with
brass numbers on the door fronts. lining the hall. There is a simple spiral stairway at the end of the passage.
Tessa starts forward, cat held tight against her.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Alexander Hauswald just follows Tessa silently.
Sacks sniffs around, curious for anything suspicious.
yeah sorry stuff going onNephi "Longiron" Delano:
Back.
"...Wheeewee."
Alexander's footsteps creak on the floor and his boots leave small prints of dust in the
rug for the first few steps. Sacks smells mostly old people, and something very sweet.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Sacks tries to pin the sweetness down as Alex follows, the dog now curious.

"Sacks smelled something he doesn't understand."Alexander Hauswald:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano doesn't actually do that
The door does not open, because it is not unlocked. Alex does manage to jiggle the
handle though. Tessa turns and gives him a look. It seems to insinuate the Alex is doing something
incomprehensible.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
(also, be back in a tick)
"It's probably just some kinda weird spice."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...Mind if I ask what's in there?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Something from... Whatsit, India?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"That's Miss Vard's room "Tessa:
"She's the one who takes care of the garden in the back."
"Ah, see? Probably peaches or summat."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I think it might be persimmons at this time of the year."Tessa:
Alexander Hauswald nods and shrugs.
I'm sorry for trying to pull you into 6AF I did not know you guys were doing a thing(From Poage):
"...Man, I remember one time I traded some bullets for a whole jar of Georgia
peaches."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Fine by me. It just confused Sacks over here.*Alexander Hauswald:
"Tasted like heaven in a bottle."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Don't like peaches."Alexander Hauswald:
"Whaaaaaaaaaaaat"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I knew you seemed odd."Tessa:
Alexander Hauswald shrugs.
"Too sweet.Alexander Hauswald:
Tessa continues up the stairs after a moment.
Alexander Hauswald keeps following, Sacks staying behind to sniff at the door.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks at the door for a short while longer before also following.
Give us a tick, things are freaking out.Tessa:
)(Doc, you okay?))UrbanCritter:
Tessa walks along the corridor until she comes to a room a fourth of the way along its length.The number
on the door is 62. Tessa opens the door with the same key she used on the door to get into this place.
(Sorry, stuff happening in another game that got my attention.)Tessa:

https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 256/791
Alexander Hauswald follows the girl, soon followed by Sacks.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano raises a curious eyebrow.
Tessa pushes the door open and enters the room. It is a small affair. Most of the space is taken up by a
bed in the corner, and the books all over the floor. Tessa walks through the maze of tomes and lays her
cat on the bed.
"...You live alone?"Alexander Hauswald:
"...Yeah, don't you got any parents? Or uh, siblings?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"No."Tessa:
"I don't."
Tessa lowers herself onto the bed next to her cat and lays a hand on the poor feline's chest.
"... My condolences."UrbanCritter:
)Net is rapidly degrading)
(Maybe we can end this here?)
"...Yeah."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...We should be gettin back though. Alex?"
"Think we do."UrbanCritter:
UrbanCritter turns to Tessa.
"Come back in two weeks, I'll pull the stitches out."Alexander Hauswald:

After the morning at the marshalry, Crystal needs some time to think over everything
that transpired. Her growling stomach leads her back to the hotel where she bought Cassie that steak. The food is
good here, and the atmosphere should not intrude on her contemplation overmuch.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"...Hello."Poage:
*Crystal Saint Claire:
Thin Waiter peers over his podium at Crystal for a moment.
"Here for lunch?"Thin Waiter:
"Yes sir."Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire is not looking at the Waiter, her eyes buried in her work.
Thin Waiter dips down to grab a menu from the shelf next to him and walks around the podium to stand in
front of Crystal. He throws one arm across the room.

"Seating preference?"Thin Waiter:
Crystal Saint Claire looks up form her work.
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Somewhere quiet... or at least, the least distracting."
Thin Waiter twiddles his mustache idly.
"There is the nook, but we do not serve there. Too much damage to the books."Thin Waiter:
"If I eat, may I go to the nook after?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Of course."Thin Waiter:
"Then.. may I sit at the empty, long table?Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire points to the table near where the Grand Marshall and his coworkers are eating.
"Indeed madam. Would you prefer your accouterments as you dine, or shall I hold them here for
you?"
Thin Waiter:
"I would prefer they remain with me."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Less chance they are negatively impacted."
"As you wish. Follow me."Thin Waiter:
Thin Waiter strides off with the menu tucked under his arm.
Crystal Saint Claire follows...
Thin Waiter slides the menu onto the table and takes a set of silverware from his apron pocket. The
utensils are arranged with spectroscopic precision a moment later.
Thin Waiter extends an arm to the seat and bows his head a few degrees.
Crystal Saint Claire nods.
Crystal Saint Claire sits.
"Thank you."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Would you like a few moments to look over the menu madam?"Thin Waiter:
"...yes, please."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Then I shall return to my post. If you have need, call on Miss Jan."Thin Waiter:
Thin Waiter struts back to his podium and attends to the book on the podium.
"Thank you. I will."Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire looks at the menu.
Machinist looks up from his sandwich for a few seconds to observe the new arrival. His eyes slip down to
his food after a minute analysis.
Crystal Saint Claire looks over at the Machinist.

https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 258/791
Crystal Saint Claire tries to observe said Machinist. What does he look like he could do? Possible threat?
(Cognition?)Crystal Saint Claire:
The menu reads, "Special today- Trout in a garlic based Oriental sauce. Sandwiches-
Reuben, Gustav Special, Steak in a bun. Salads- Mixed Greens and chicken with Oriental dressing, Romaine with
breaded lamb. Steaks of all sizes and cuts, cooked to order. Sides vary with dish." There is a list of beer, wine,
and soda on the back.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
(That is a lot of typing)Crystal Saint Claire:
(There we go)
(...is that a fucking hamburger)
She will get...
Hm...
She looks for "Miss Jan"
Machinist is dressed in a stained vest and an undershirt that has a tattoo peeking over the top. He looks
young, but weathered. There is a cigarette butt next to his plate.
"...salad, Gustav, and?"Missus Waiter:
"I'll just have a bottle of red."Wily Galen:
Crystal Saint Claire hears a familiar voice!
Crystal Saint Claire turns towards that voice!
"Right."Missus Waiter:
"...oh!"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Hello, Mr. Garen!"
Wily Galen the skin around his eyes scrunches together for a moment in what might be a blink. He turns
to Crystal. Recognition dawns after a moment and he waves.
"Hey kid."Wily Galen:
"How has your day been?"Crystal Saint Claire:
Missus Waiter looks to Crystal, then flips to a new page in her notebook.
Crystal Saint Claire glances at the soda menu.
"Pretty good, haven't had more than eight people drag my name through the mud."Wily Galen:
Is there sasparilla?Crystal Saint Claire:
Yes.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"...why would people drag your name through the mud? It would be like insulting a cripple..."Crystal Saint Claire:
There is also an option to upgrade any soda to a sarsaparilla float.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Crystal Saint Claire seems genuinely confused at this

"Well, there's some folks that do insult cripples."Wily Galen:
Crystal Saint Claire moves closer so that they aren't calling out across the restaurant.
"They are, almost to the person, detestable."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Mmmm."Wily Galen:
"I say almost because I cannot provide empirical evidence."Crystal Saint Claire:
"What kind of evidence?"Wily Galen:
Missus Waiter taps the table with her pencil.
"Empirical. Evidence that cannot-- oh! Sorry..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Ready to order?"Missus Waiter:
"May I have a sasparilla, and the Gustav Special, please?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"...what is the gustav special?"
Missus Waiter scribbles the order down on her pad before looking up again.
"Is the cook's name Gustav?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Cook's name is Duret."Missus Waiter:
"Gustav handles the...beverages."
"Liberal consumption of which was involved in the creation of the Gustav Special."
"...that sounds interesting."Crystal Saint Claire:
"It's a sandwich with two chicken breasts battered and covered in hot sauce. Add a few fixings
and a good slice of sharp cheddar and you got the Gustav special."
Missus Waiter:
"...That sounds delicious!"Crystal Saint Claire:
"...Would you mind asking them to be gentle, with the heat?"
"No problem."Missus Waiter:
"...Thank you!"Crystal Saint Claire:
"That all?"Missus Waiter:
"Y-yes, ma'am."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Right, should have it out in a couple minutes."Missus Waiter:
Missus Waiter turns on her heel and slumps off towards the counter at the back.
Crystal Saint Claire nods, and brings her workbook up onto the counter.
She's on a page with... math... on it.Crystal Saint Claire:
Fat Waiter pops out of the small doorway that leads behind the counter with visible effort. He bounces
over to the table where Galen and the rest of the marshalry crew sit with a tray of drinks held aloft by one
hand.

("Mawwiage... Twue wove...")Crystal Saint Claire:
Fat Waiter sets down a beer, a chilled bottle of wine, and a glass of tea.
Fat Waiter shifts his weight and angles himself towards Crystal's table, momentum takes care of the rest.
Fat Waiter sets a bottle of sarsaparilla down onto the tabletop.
"Enjoy youw bevewage deaw."Fat Waiter:
"Thank you, sir!"Crystal Saint Claire:
"...are you Gustav?"
Fat Waiter tucks the tray under his arm.

It has been a while since everyone finished up at the Marshalry. It is a little past lunch time and everyone needs

Cassie-May O'Brien nods and tips her hat to the Marshall and his lackeys before removing it from her
head and placing on the table next to her
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers watches Alexander walk around and up onto the table
((jk))Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
Overmarshal Fossifer has his nose buried too deep in a sandwich to notice at the moment.
Alexander Hauswald just watches the little tea party from his spot by the table.
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers also removes her hat and sets it next to her
"...Guess Deadmen's gotta eat too."Alexander Hauswald:
Thin Waiter strides back over to his podium.
Alexander Hauswald has no hat to remove.
Wily Galen is busying himself with a bottle of red wine. There seems to be no food on his portion of the
table.

"...there simply must be a reason for it. It's been going from best to worst."Secretary:
Cassie-May O'Brien listens in
Wily Galen swirls his bottle of wine a few times before taking a gulp.
"Why the hell would anyone go from best to worst?"Wily Galen:
"And how would they know who the best is and the worst is?"
Alexander Hauswald just listens silently, looking at the menu.
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers listens as well
The menu reads, "Special today- Trout in a garlic based Oriental sauce. Sandwiches-
Reuben, Gustav Special, Steak in a bun. Salads- Mixed Greens and chicken with Oriental dressing, Romaine with
breaded lamb. Steaks of all sizes and cuts, cooked to order. Sides vary with dish." There is a list of beer, wine,
and soda on the back.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"...Sacks is going to like this."Alexander Hauswald:
Cassie-May O'Brien glances on the prices.
Overmarshal Fossifer sets his sandwich down and wipes his mouth with a stained handkerchief.

"Ready to order?"Missus Waiter:

Cassie-May O'Brien turned to the waitress.

Rockett Rimbjob chuckles a little to herself, taking a sip from the bottle as she looks over her shoulder at
the doorway. "See y'all later, fellas~!" she calls out, smiling a sly grin. Her dress has slipped down past
her shoulders, revealing a remarkable amount of chest and bare skin to any onlookers. Her dress, tight
and short, is well-kept, and... almost up to her knees. Let's say it

Alexander Hauswald nods at the newcomer. And also at the floating ghost hat.
"Unless y'all packin' a sausage on eggs under tha' skirt, nawt really."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is visibly sweating.
"Packin' a whole lot more'n that."Rockett Rimbjob:

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers chuckles again, watching all this unfold
Nephi "Longiron" Delano does his damndest not to look.
"If I tell you it's his birthday, will you make it harder on him?"Alexander Hauswald:
Rockett Rimbjob walks over.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano notices her walking over.
Fat Waiter approaches the table in an odd motion that looks like an approaching storm of flab held in
check only by the starch in his white shirt. He has a tray of drinks in one hand and a tray of food in the
other.
Rockett Rimbjob leans forward, resting on her elbows.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks normal. Ish.
Rockett Rimbjob gives him a niiiiiice good look at her cleavage.
"Ah'm gunna buy yew a beer if y'all sit in his lap."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano screams internally.
"Kid. Kid, it's okay."Alexander Hauswald:
"Ah'll buy ya one too! Double 'r nothin'."Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
Fat Waiter pauses in deference to Rockett.
"She won't bite."Alexander Hauswald:
"I think."
"Probableh."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Ah won't bite, sweetie. Quite tha opposite~"Rockett Rimbjob:
Rockett Rimbjob sits down right next to him.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano stiffens like a board as she approaches.
Cassie-May O'Brien snickers
Rockett Rimbjob gets reeeeal close, and slides a leg over his.
"H-h-h-owdy ma'am."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Alexander Hauswald is actively trying not to laugh.
"Lovely eeeevenin."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"How you doin~?"Rockett Rimbjob:
Fat Waiter chuckles to himself as he sets both trays down. His hands flit to his mustache and he twists
the end of it to calm his fidgeting hand.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano stares straight ahead. Thinkin about Granny Delano lookin right at him with her
piercing pioneer eyes and puritanical spirit.
"You ain't never had a tussle with a missus, have ya, sweetie..?"Rockett Rimbjob:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano straight up faints.
Rockett Rimbjob holds her mouth to her hand and starts -laughing.-
Alexander Hauswald starts laughing. Hard. You weren't aware he's capable of showing this much
emotion.
"...Ah think Ah did a good job..."Rockett Rimbjob:
Rockett Rimbjob looks at the others at the table. "Now, about them beers..."
"...Sweet Mary Magdalene, Ah didn' think he'd actually faint."Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Job offer. We're the new marshals."Alexander Hauswald:
Rockett Rimbjob raises her brows.
"New marshals?"Rockett Rimbjob:
Fat Waiter sets both down in the middle of the table and takes the silvery serving trays back to his post
behind the counter.

Cassie-May O'Brien pushed the platters with food to respective owners and took a huge gulp of her beer.
Rockett Rimbjob grabs her own beer happily.
"Ain't that somethin'."Rockett Rimbjob:
Alexander Hauswald set the plate with the rare steak aside, grabbing his own steak-in-a-bun.
Cassie-May O'Brien cracked her fingers and stared at the extra spicy Gustav Special.
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers takes a bite of her sandwich and washes it down with a gulp of beer
"...Tally ho."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Asked for us specifically, too."Alexander Hauswald:
Cassie-May O'Brien ate a forkful.
"Really."Rockett Rimbjob:
"Who'd ya impress?"
"Or who'd ya blow?"
Alexander Hauswald looks at Cassie, judging her reaction before taking a bite from his sandwich.
Alexander Hauswald shrugs at Rockett.
Yep. The Marshals are the law in the neutral territories. Kansas City is their base of operations. They
also hire out their services to other places if the price is right. Rockett works for the marshalry sometimes when
there's a job that suits the taste of her and her pocketbook. The fat one is Gustav, he does the drinks.. The woman
one is Jan, she does the not wanting to be here. The thin one is Einhart, he runs most of the hotel. The cook's
name is Duret.
(To Scotty):
Cassie-May O'Brien is waiting for Doc's decision
"Just got the letter one day. Not exactly well known before."Alexander Hauswald:

Fat Waiter perks up from where he was pouring himself a bottle of wine, pouring it down his throat
straight from the bottle.
"Can a bring me a payback, honeydoll?"Rockett Rimbjob:
a cigar(From Rockett Rimbjob):
Fat Waiter nods for a moment before disappearing through the doors to, assumedly, the kitchen.
"...Eh, from whut Ah can take, each of us got sum' fun adventures under our belts."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien ate another forkful.
"..."Alexander Hauswald:
"Ain' half bad. Coulda stand ta be spicier."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Alexander Hauswald took a bite from his own sandwich, slowly reaching for the beer.
"But. Ah'm familiar with tha Marshals. They usually bring in good folk, but... they been lax
lately, it seems. Lazy. Maybe a little desperate."
Rockett Rimbjob:
"Y'all ain't second-rate, are ya?"
"Or crooks? Ah hate crooks."
Cassie-May O'Brien looked at Rockett
Fat Waiter pops back out and heads over to Rockett with a cigar in one hand and a matchbook in the
other.
"I think we're the new generation."Alexander Hauswald:
Rockett Rimbjob takes the cigar and matchbook, nodding to him once.
Fat Waiter proffers the payback.
"Thank ya kindly."Rockett Rimbjob:
"Ain' no second-rate crook, sugercube."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Fat Waiter bows with one arm held over his paunch, and retires to his drinking.
"Good ta hear. Ah take it ya gonna prove that ta me soon, then."Rockett Rimbjob:
"Somethin' tells me it ain't a coincidence y'all showed up right now, right here."
Alexander Hauswald lifts a brow.
((Also, doc, verdict on the spicy?))Alexander Hauswald:
"Y'all knew them deposed marshals, missus Rockett?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"They was mah steady income, friends, an' colleagues -- sure as shit Ah knew 'em."Rockett Rimbjob:
The spiciness appears to have been tailored to be not too terrifying, unless the fool
who ordered it asked for the spice. In that case, the spice appears mild at first, but after one good bite goes down
the hatch, it comes up from the stomach like a volcanic eruption.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Rockett Rimbjob lights her thin cigar and gives it a few puffs to get it burning.

"Welp, missus Rockett, any info woulda be apprecciated. Anythin' unusual happenin' ta
them lateleh? Someone them stepped on them toes ?"
Cassie-May O'Brien:
do I know anything from being a nosy whore(From Rockett Rimbjob):
added to charsheet, doc.dimVitrarius:
Information seems scant. Dead marshals tell no tales. All that anyone seems to know right now is
that they appear to be dying in the line of work. There's something real goddamn fishy about that though and not a
lot has been done to hide it. Just enough is wrong to know there's something up without enough being wrong to
find out what the cause is.
(To Scotty):
Like Jones a couple months ago. He was a good shooter, and a tough bastard to kill. Died in a
shootout with some strange desperado that rolled into town and rolled out soon as Jones was cold.
(To Scotty):
(Gonna be away for a bit.)Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"Well. Ah wish Ah could tell ya anythin' more'n Ah already know. Much as Ah hate ta say it,
dead marshals tell no tales. Fishier'n an unwashed ham-holster, an' it's infuriatin' that Ah ain't been able ta do
nothin' about it."
Rockett Rimbjob:
"Ah'm employed, but in mah line of work, business an' pleasure are one an' tha same -- jus' so happens ya get ta
know these folks real well. Ah'd go right ahead an' say Ah made a few good friends. Like Jones, couple months
ago -- tough bastard, good shot with any gun he held, tougher'n a brick shithouse. Died in a shootout, of all things,
with some... desperado that rolled in, an' was gone like a fart in tha wind soon as Jones was glass-eyed."
"Been diggin' fer a lot more than gold lately. Comin' up drier'n a nun's nasties."
"...My condolences."Alexander Hauswald:

the bulging coinpurse on her hip.

Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Anything at all. No matter how minor."Alexander Hauswald:
Anything?(From Rockett Rimbjob):
Rockett Rimbjob looks at Cassie. "Took tha phrase 'shoot an' scoot' ta whole new levels. But 'side from 'is
speed, his dead eye, an' his determination ta run me outta mah line of work, Ah can't think of nothin' off
tha top of mah head."
(I gotta go. I got work soon-ish that I need to get ready for)Moondew:
"Nawt even his looks?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Dead eye. That his aiming or his actual eye?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Aimin'. Motherfucker outshot Jones, an' Ah was hard-pressed ta outshoot 'em mahself."Rockett Rimbjob:
"An' no. Didn't see 'em. Ah was here when it happened."
"...Where'd it happen, then?"Alexander Hauswald:

"Tha clinic. Jones was goin' in ta get bled, an'..."Rockett Rimbjob:
"...well. Sure as hell got bled all right."
"Right. How long ago? Is anyone who worked that day still working?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Hm."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Couple months ago. Doc Mitchell's high-tailed it ta Dodge."Rockett Rimbjob:
"Don't blame 'em, bastard just about got shot."
"...Guess that's our first witness, Cass."Alexander Hauswald:
The only thing anyone can say about the stranger is that his clothes were ragged, and his hat was
black as coal.
(To Scotty):
"Doc Mitchell in Dodge. Y'all know of anyun' else who coulda see th' scene?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...Ah actually heard one thing from mah last buyer. But it ain't nothin' surprisin' -- he was one
of them egotistical, shady bastards, with ragged clothes an' one of them ugly black hats."
Rockett Rimbjob:
"An' no. Ain't nobody else saw this 'cept tha killer."
"...What'd he say?"Alexander Hauswald:
I'm sorry I improv'd so much I hope it's fine(From Rockett Rimbjob):

"Here's hoping Doc Mitchell can say something."Alexander Hauswald:
"...That's every living one, Cass."
"Slow ones don't stay living."

Cassie-May O'Brien:
Rockett Rimbjob puffs from her cigar, letting out a quiet sigh.
Alexander Hauswald taps his holster.
"Usually folks pay me ta find that out, hun."Rockett Rimbjob:
Cassie-May O'Brien aimed that last question at Rockett of course.
"Depends on how generous the manitou are."Alexander Hauswald:
Rockett Rimbjob smirks slyly ar Cass.

Rockett Rimbjob reaches down and slips something out of a thigh holster.
Did you like your intro, by the by?(To Scotty):
"An' whether y'all prefer derrngers or rifles an' consarn it."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Rockett Rimbjob sets down an enormous derringer on the counter -- a good five inch long barrel, with a
bore bigger than any reasonable fellow would consider good for a handgun.
Cassie-May O'Brien pinched the bridge of her nose and snorted a laugh.
"...We're all adults here."Alexander Hauswald:
Rockett Rimbjob slides it over to Cass. Two bullets spill out of the chamber and roll across the chable --
very large bullets, in fact.
Alexander Hauswald examines the gun curiously.
Cassie-May O'Brien stared at the derringer.
"...What IS that?"Alexander Hauswald:
Cassie-May O'Brien stared at Rockett.
Cassie-May O'Brien stared at her skirt.
"Fifty-ninety sharps derringer. Custom-made. Bond arms, straight from Houston."Rockett Rimbjob:
Rockett Rimbjob shuffles her skirt back down.

Cassie-May O'Brien was dressed like a man, somewhat wiry, and bags under her eyes were probably
bigger than her breasts.
"Think you got better things to be self-conscious about."Alexander Hauswald:
"Ah was about ta say."Rockett Rimbjob:
"You jus' signed up ta be a marshal. An' one look at you, an' Ah can say yer ass is tha least of yer problems, hun."
Rockett Rimbjob takes a sip of her beer and another puff from her cigar.
"Oi, mah arse is damn perfect."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"That's what Ah jus' said."Rockett Rimbjob:
Alexander Hauswald stays quiet on that one.
"Ya ears, though, could use some work..."Rockett Rimbjob:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano stays very quiet, having gone back to staring at the table.
Rockett Rimbjob pats Nephi's thigh.
"...Whut's wrong with mah ears?"Cassie-May O'Brien:

Rockett Rimbjob giggles.
"That ain't possible."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano stares back into the table.
"Rockett Rimbjob."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Rockett Rimbjob raises her eyebrows, and glances at the mostly-empty bottle of champagne on the table.
Alexander Hauswald tries to cough and clear his airway, looking bewildered.
"Darn tootin'."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Well."Rockett Rimbjob:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks to Alex with eyes pleading for help
"Any one of them fellas upstairs'd tell ya true."Rockett Rimbjob:

Rockett Rimbjob gulps a couple times.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano actually laughs, relaxing just a tiny bit.
Rockett Rimbjob sets her mug down and looks at Cass.
"Hun Ah lost mah class tha moment Ah booked it from home, Ah ain't gonna act proper in a
place like this."
Rockett Rimbjob:
"Now. If Ah was in somewhere a little less rustic? Or Ah was gettin' payed a lot more? Maybe. Ah ain't bad at
holdin' up a classy facade."
"Ah jus' dont wanna."
Rockett Rimbjob looks at the bar around her.

Alexander Hauswald tries to stifle another laughter.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano actually managed to look her in the face for that one fleeting moment before
turning back to the table and turning red.
"...Y'didn't happen to entertain a fella named Helaman while you were there, did
you?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...My brother has a way of findin out where the... Ladies o'the evenin are."

"Haven't laughed this hard for three years."Alexander Hauswald:

Alexander Hauswald 's smile fades.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano stands up, throws down a couple dollars, then walks right the hell out.
Cassie-May O'Brien snickered into her booze.
Rockett Rimbjob looks at Nephi as he waltzes out.

Rockett Rimbjob slides back into her seat, cigar-less.
Sacks barks and nods.
"Aight. We'll be out soon enough, yeah?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Tessa looks up to Rocket for a few moments longer than seems normal.
"What happened to your stogie Miss?"Tessa:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano stends up and stretches, then heads back inside.
"Finished it."Rockett Rimbjob:
Sacks focuses on his food on the meanwhile.
"Tasted good."Rockett Rimbjob:
((That was me))Alexander Hauswald:
((I meant Alex))
"You smoke fast."Tessa:
"Ah had it for a good while."Rockett Rimbjob:
"Is it better to smoke fast or slow?"Tessa:
"Ah."
"Aight folks, feelin better now."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"An' those are smaller cigars, too. Better ta smoke slow, but... sometimes yer like me, an'
stressed."
Rockett Rimbjob:
"Don't be like me, sweetie."
"I don't think I have the assets for your profession."Tessa:
"So, while I been busy... Studyin the table... We figure out our first job?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Cassie-May O'Brien coughed a laugh into her beer
"Yeah."Alexander Hauswald:
"I hope not, at least."Tessa:
"Fill me in?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Now or later. You stick to tha straight an' narrow, you," she says to the little girl, before turning
back to her drinks.
Rockett Rimbjob:
"Rockett here lost one of her friends. We're heading to Doc Mitchell's to question him
about the desperado that killed him."
Alexander Hauswald:
"One?"Rockett Rimbjob:
"Try a dozen."

"...Yer uh... Gentlemen friends, or uh..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano turns a bit red.
"Yer friends?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Yes an' no. They've all been marshals."Rockett Rimbjob:
"Coworkers."
"...Hmm."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...most of 'em were bedfellas though. But that ain't important."Rockett Rimbjob:
"...Well, seems like a job for us, definitely."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Don't-don't-don't wanna know none bout that."
"Right. We about done here, fellas?"
"Ah kinda do but Ah shouldn' ask."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Ah won't say nothin'. Not now, front'a these two."Rockett Rimbjob:
"I got a hankerin to get stuff done and get paid."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Finish your food, kid."Alexander Hauswald:
"...Mruh."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Don't hold your tongue on my account."Tessa:
"Wasting food's a sin."Alexander Hauswald:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano leans in and slides his plate down past Alex.
"Gettin' paid's good. Think Ah'm gunna be flat broke after this dinner here."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I've been told that I'm too precocious for my own good."Tessa:
"Mostly by Mister Lane."
"Ah'm holdin' it anyway. Little girl like you shouldn't be seein' me, let alone talkin' ta me."Rockett Rimbjob:
Cassie-May O'Brien finished her two dishes in the meantime.
"Darn tootin it is."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"If you say so."Tessa:
"...Mister Lane. Tellin' his daughter ta be innocent an' precious."Rockett Rimbjob:
"Huh."
Rockett Rimbjob looks at Cass.
Alexander Hauswald wipes his mouth, drinking from his mug.
Rockett Rimbjob raises her brows.
"Oh, Mister Lane isn't my father."Tessa:

"Oh?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"He just tries to take care of me."Tessa:
"He's yer father even if y'aint blood."Rockett Rimbjob:
Cassie-May O'Brien rubbed her chin.
"Hmmm..."Tessa:
"True."
"You'n Crystal would probably get on right as rain."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"He's not your father."Alexander Hauswald:
"He can still be your dad."
"I imagine he's sitting back there with Miss Vard trying not to look concerned and failing."Tessa:
Rockett Rimbjob finishes her beer, and then grabs her bottle of wine.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks to Alex with a curious expression at that.
"...Ah think Ah'll have a chat with him later."Rockett Rimbjob:
"Yew do tha'."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Anyhow. Been workin' all day, Ah'm right worn out. Gonna hit tha sack soon -- fer real this
time."
Rockett Rimbjob:
"Leavin' wit'out a goodnight's kiss?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"You fellas don't take a step ta Dodge without lettin' me know. Ah got a score ta settle with Doc
Mitchell, an' Ah got an interest in this case besides."
Rockett Rimbjob:
"Y;all say yer gunna come wit' us?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"..."Alexander Hauswald:
"Damn straight."Rockett Rimbjob:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano seems a little bit uncomfortable with that idea, but significantly less than when
miss Rockett arrived.
"Welcome aboard."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"You'll need a better gun."Alexander Hauswald:
"...She can borrow one'a my rifles."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Hang on."Alexander Hauswald:
"..."Rockett Rimbjob:
"Excuse me?"
Cassie-May O'Brien blinked. Nah, too easy.
Rockett Rimbjob seems genuinely insulted.

"What kinda second-rate marshal needs more than one, let alone two?"Rockett Rimbjob:

"It's more of a trophy than a real gun."Alexander Hauswald:
"Y'all didn' see them things Ah shot down/"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"At least for me."Alexander Hauswald:
"One of em's prone to breakin. Fancy new tech from the mads back in Deseret."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Guess we'll find out once we head out Doc Mitchell's way, eh?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"An' Ah've been 'round tha block."Rockett Rimbjob:
"...How many things did you have to kill, exactly?"Alexander Hauswald:
Tessa kicks her legs underneath the table as she watches the drama unfold.
"More things'n Ah've had ta ride."Rockett Rimbjob:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano scoffs.
"Hope it stays tha' way, sugercube. Anyway! Y'all go hit th' hay. Ah'm gunna go find yew
when we're gunna roll fer Doc Mitchell."
Cassie-May O'Brien:

Cassie-May O'Brien looked at the waitress.
"We're gunna be payin'!"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...That's two and a half from me, plus beers."Alexander Hauswald:
"I'll just put down two."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Missus Waiter stops making eyes at Gustav and heads back on over to the table.

"oookay.

Alexander Hauswald puts five dollars down.

Alexander Hauswald points at the rare steak.
"That's for Sacks."Alexander Hauswald:
Along with the booze.Missus Waiter:
And Cassie's lunch.Alexander Hauswald:
"Oh."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Five bucks is probably enough to pay for EVERYBODY at the table, plus beers.
Missus Waiter collects the money and tucks it into her apron pocket.
"Change?"Missus Waiter:
"How much?"Alexander Hauswald:
"I'm asking if you want it."Missus Waiter:

Missus Waiter digs around in her front pocket and lays down a half dollar and a quarter.

Dice are not necessary.Rockett Rimbjob:
TFN taught me that.
Mainly because you want to avoid rolling dice as often as possible in TFNNephi "Longiron" Delano:
Because every time you do TFN luck happens

It has been a troubling few days for Whitney. The sickness that came on a few days
after she arrived kept her in her room above at the saloon. Crystal kept an eye on her, though she insisted on
wearing a gas mask. The illness passed a day after it arrived and Whitney is feeling her oats again. She heads
over to the Marshalry offices to talk to the man that summoned her.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Wily Galen pokes his head up over his desk to look at the new arrival.
"Hey, Emilia."Wily Galen:
"What is it Ga-"Secretary:
"Oh."
Secretary shoves her chair back from her desk and strides over to Whitney.
Whitney G. Elieen moves forward,one heavy step at a time. Feeling refreshed after so long spent in
sickness.
"Hello. God bless you this fine morning...I am here to answer my summons."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Hello, you must be Miss Whitney."Secretary:
"Foss-"
Secretary clears her throat.
"The Overmarshal is waiting for you."Secretary:
Whitney G. Elieen smiles
"Right this way."Secretary:
"Perfect. I shall follow your lead."Whitney G. Elieen:
Secretary walks up to the desk at the back of the office where a dark skinned, black haired man sits with
his boots up on his desk and his hat over his eyes.
Secretary smiles at Whitney as slams her hand down on the desk.
Overmarshal Fossifer jumps, then lifts his hat with a slow hand.
1/20/2018 Chat Log for Wonderful Cowboy Adventure Land
https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 297/791
Whitney G. Elieen tilts her head but smiles all the same
"Sorry, had lunch not too long ago."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Hello Overmarshal Fossifer."Whitney G. Elieen:
Overmarshal Fossifer takes his boots off the desk and rearranges himself to appear more professional.
"I take it you are Miss Whitney?"Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Yes. That is I. Whitney Gould Elieen."Whitney G. Elieen:
"And I'm Mister Fossifer."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"God Bless, Mr.Fossifer...I am here to answer your summons."Whitney G. Elieen:
"I am sorry I did not get to meet sooner. I came ill of disease. Normally God has blessed me with good health, but
this time I feel I was to be tested."
Overmarshal Fossifer holds his hand up for a moment as if to speak, but ends the movement holding his
chin.
"I see."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"I called you, and your companions, here, because I am in need of a miracle."
"My marshals have been dying by the dozen."
"I do not know an exact reason why."
"But I need help."
"Help from people who want to do good work."
"People no concerned with money, or power of a badge."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"I see. How blessed you are that I work for the ultimate miracle maker." She says with a
smile. "I have been led here I believe for a reason. To save as many as I can and to show them that the Lord I
serve has not ignored their prayers."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"I have no interest in the badge and have no need for mortal trappings beyond what is necessary to do his work. "
"I need only direction."
Overmarshal Fossifer grunts as he drags a hand across the lines of his face.
"Don't agree about Lord business, but agree that people need to be saved."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Told your friends about losing Billy's old caselog."
"Figured he might be alive enough to worry about."
"But, heard them while at lunch."
"Met up with Rockett and she put them on the scent of Doc Mitchell."
"Part of deal about Mysterious gunslinger shot Jones two months back."
"Knew it was real bad when Mitchell up and ran."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Not too brave, but don't know him to abandon patient."
"That is the beautiful thing about him, Overmarshal. He believes in you even if you do not
believe in him. But as for Mitchel...odd that a doctor would abandon his oath to his patient."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"This Rockett is a friend of yours?"

"Marshal, most of time."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Also happens to..."
"Work at brothel, sometimes."
"Good woman."
"Many good women end up in unclean professions unfortunately...Not that God loves them
any less."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Like spies in Canaan."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Whores alright, long as they don't corrupt decent folk."
"Never understand any religion."
"They do as they do for they feel there is no other choice...or they do not know a better way.
My task here on this earth is to show them the better way."
Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen smiles
"I would like to pay a visit to her if i can. For reasons spiritual and mundane."Whitney G. Elieen:
"She knows our direction after all."
Overmarshal Fossifer squints at something he can only see for a moment, before turning to the red haired
woman in the green dress.
"I can probably find her at the hotel if need be."Secretary:
"And you, being so capable, can do without me for a little while."
Overmarshal Fossifer gives a solemn nod to the Secretary's words.
"Anything else you need Miss Whitney?"Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Nothing further at this time."Whitney G. Elieen:
"I don't have anything else for you."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Just remember that I am here."
"Maybe your Lord need me to help you for Him sometime."
"Perhaps he does. As I follow her path it will become clear either way. Wherever the path
takes me I shall follow."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"God bless you Overmarshal."
"..."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Her, path?"
"Never heard anyone consider that before."
"Yes. Her path. It would be folly to think of God in the limited binary of us, the created. He is
beyond our understanding but for his power and splendor and her mercy and love."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Such is the word of God herself."
Overmarshal Fossifer says nothing as he scratches the scruff of his chin. His eyes stay on Whitney.
"Wise words, wiser than I've heard in long time."Overmarshal Fossifer:
"Glad to have you Miss Whitney."

"I have had a wise teacher." She says with a bow of her head. "A pleasure Overmarshal."Whitney G. Elieen:
"All mine, Miss Whitney."Overmarshal Fossifer:
Overmarshal Fossifer tips his hat to her.
"All mine."Overmarshal Fossifer:
Secretary walks forward and takes Whitney's arm, as best she can. It is similar to a child trying to put his
hand around an entire cow.
"I'll accompany you to the hotel Miss Whitney."Secretary:
"Can't have the faithful losing their way."
"Thank you, sister. Let us make our way."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen starts her trek out of the building. Walking slowly so the secretary could keep up with
her tall stride.
The Secretary leads Whitney across town. She seems a little intimidated by Whitney's
size at first, but spreads a grin across her face and attempt conversation despite.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"So, would you like to discuss..."Secretary:
"Erm..."
"Your...faith?"
"Apologies, I don't know too much about you other than your religious preference and your history of do goodery."
"It was, the most salient information."
"I'm sure there's more to you than that."
"Not to say that it isn't good to show yourself, righteous and all that."Secretary:
"I..."
"Am babbling."
"No. No you are fine. Though I would like to discuss faith. If you are so inclined." She says
with a warm smile, looking down at the much smaller woman.
Whitney G. Elieen:
"I am always happy to discuss my faith with the curious."
"I am curious."Secretary:
"Some say it's my vice."
"Sticking my nose where some don't like noses stuck."
"A dangerous trait. But a righteous one. God loves those who love to know. Though if the
story of Eden is any indication it does not come without its grave dangers."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"There is also a strong danger in not knowing. Ignorance of the greater truth has doomed humanity since before
and beyond the era of Christ."
"I suppose there are some things I'd rather not know, but I only knew that after I'd learned them."Secretary:
"But knowing more has helped us all a great deal."
"And once knowledge begins it perpetuates itself, to some extent."
"Like a stone rolling down a hill."
1/20/2018 Chat Log for Wonderful Cowboy Adventure Land
https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 300/791
"Right. And as it rolls down the hill our control of it, for better or worse, is done. All we can do
now is to react to the stone. We can either use what we know and step out of the way or be ignorant of it and be
rolled over."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"...that's a direction I hadn't considered for that simile."Secretary:
"But, I suppose it applies."
"The knowledge in and of itself is neither good nor evil. How we respond to this knowledge,
however, can be either. "
Whitney G. Elieen:
"I can agree to that."Secretary:
"Nobel invented dynamite for construction and excavation."
"Not as a tool of war."
"It depends a lot on the knowledge I suppose. Some is hard to grasp. Some is beyond our
comprehension as mortal beings...and some brings sublime comfort."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Or so it should."
"The bible is a great tool...but a dangerous one in the hands of those who do not understand it."
"Or refuse to."
"Like dynamite"
"Indeed, Copernicus comes to mind."Secretary:
"The bible has nothing to say on heliocentric or geocentric theory, but the papacy assumed the knowledge of the
day to be part of God's truth and would hear nothing to contradict their geocentric view."
"I know little of the sciences...but I do know a great deal of the folly of mortal churches. The
papacy in particular. A decadent institution more concerned with dogma and ritual than truth...and yet through
them God can work wonders."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Yet it saddens me...and saddens her for that matter that her message of love can be warped and twisted so."
Secretary nods her head with evident enthusiasm.
"Yes, it is so frustrating when people refuse to understand."Secretary:
"They don't look at what you're showing them."
"They're looking at something inside their own heads."
"They are not concerned with her truth...but their truth. The truth that is most comforting to
them."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Jesus fought hard against this when he was here on this earth."
"Not many know but he was quite the rebel."
"Spreading the message of the Lord and her truth of love, despite what the Pharisees taught."
"The pharisees being, at the time, among the highest of their religious order. These were Godly men. Or so it was
said."
"People do often say they are one thing while they are something entirely different."Secretary:
"One can have the faith to move mountains...the gift of prophecy, command of the kingdoms
of man and beyond and yet if they have not love in their hearts..."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"They are nothing."
"Today it is more than just the Pharsiee we must look out for...the forces of evil have become bold."

https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 301/791
"They know their time is coming to a close. So they seek to turn as many away from God's love as they can."
"I suppose."Secretary:
"From what I've seen, there are more concerned with damning the mortal body to a wormy pit than slaying souls."
"And it is in this wormy pit that they learn to despair. The forces of evil are blunt. Jesus
himself paid the ultimate price because of it."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"And yet he overcame all the same."
"Indeed he did."Secretary:
"Indeed..."
Secretary twiddles her finger as the Kansas City hotel comes into view.
"I'm going to be honest and say that I have no idea what to say next."Secretary:
"Though, we are here, sort of."
"Miss Rockett should not be hard to find."
"Remember this. God loves you. I shall keep you in my prayers. Knowledge can be comfort
as well...take comfort that she is watching over you."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Thank you kindly for taking me here."
"Oh, no problem at all."Emilia:
"If you need any help finding Miss Rockett, talk to the waiters."
"The thin one is Einhart, the lady who looks like she wants to be somewhere else is Jan, the fat one is Gustav, and
the cook with the odd hair is Duret."
"Thank you so much." She says with a smile. "Be safe and God bless."Whitney G. Elieen:
"I am sure the waiters will guide my way from here."
"Right, be safe Miss Whitney."Emilia:
Emilia turns and walks off to the marshalry offices.
(That should be good until tomorrow, or when we can get Scotty.)Emilia:
(Yes!~)Whitney G. Elieen:

"...Like a... Tarnation, Ah got a colorful comparision there but Ah lost it.'Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Ain't had much ta eat t'day. Means Ah want more. An' it makes 'em kick a little harder'n they
usually do."
Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob sighs, swirling her beer around in the bottle she holds. "It'll be good ta head back ta
Dodge though. Ain't been there fer a time."
"Y'ever been?"Rockett Rimjob:
"Ta Dodge? Eeeyup, once. Jus' in passin', though. Didn' see much a' it."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Not a bad place. Ain't too big, but it's got its charm. Few caravaners an' workers with some
stuffy wallets Ah'm familiar with."
Rockett Rimjob:
"Usually spend a spell there on mah way west an' east."
"They got a nice bar. Real nice. Place ya'd never expect ta find in a place like Dodge."
"Ah thought Dodge's made solely outta places y'all don't expect ta find in Dodge."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien took a gulp of beer.
"...'bout sums it up, honestly."Rockett Rimjob:
Cassie-May O'Brien grinned.
"Y'all been travellin' a lot?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Oh, you bet."Rockett Rimjob:
"Moment Ah left home Ah kept walkin' with these boots of mahne 'til Ah found a coast."
"Then Ah turned around an' kept walkin' again. 'Til Ah got bored of that -- then Ah started walkin' south 'til Ah hit
tha Rio Grande, an' north 'til Ah got too cold."
"Don't usually cross tha Mississippi no more, though. Ah tend ta like it out here."
"Ah'm pretty cimilar, sugercube. Jus' Ah got enough of a brains ta git mahself a horse when
Ah could."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien sipped coffee.
Rockett Rimjob gives Cassie a look.
"Smartass."Rockett Rimjob:
"All tha' walkin' done good fer yer calves though."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Thank you, thank you~!"Rockett Rimjob:
"Gotta put sum' honey on all tha' smartass stingin', don't Ah?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien snickered.
"Smartasses keep tha world interestin'. Or they make it tough."Rockett Rimjob:
"Usually tha first one."
Rockett Rimjob finishes off her bottle and sets it down with a thud.

"Which un' am Ah so far?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Well, ya ain't been dumb enough ta pull a gun on me yet."Rockett Rimjob:
"Ah'd say yer doin' good on me."
"Ye wuzn' dumb enough ta giv' meh a reason ta pull a gun on yew, so... Guess we're gunna
be thick as thieves, goin' like this."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...This reminds meh. Ah always fergit to do tha'."
Cassie-May O'Brien grumbled to herself, finished her beer, and pulled out the double-barrelled shotgun on
the table before her.
Rockett Rimjob looks at it.
"...not bad."Rockett Rimjob:
"Little hefty fer mah tastes, though."
"Mnn."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien broke it open and fished out the two shells.
"Plan B here saved mah sorry arse a few tahmes, hefty as it is."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Better'n no gun, that's fer sure."Rockett Rimjob:
"Pretty good-lookin', too, even though it ain't mah style."
Cassie-May O'Brien checked the barrells and put in two different-colored shells. Slugs.
"Ah usually am fahne wit' mah Winchester. This here's mostleh fer them oh-shit scenarios,
sugercube."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien - come to think of it - has an absurd amount of weapons on her. This shotgun, the
Winchester rifle secure in the sling, a Colt Navy on her hip, a saber on other hip, a Bowie knife, another
two knives...
"...luggin' around all that iron oughta be a real pain."Rockett Rimjob:
"Mah back's killin' meh."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"That's why Ah got an all-purpose fucker-upper on mah thigh."Rockett Rimjob:
"Eeeyup, but it got only two shots innit."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Most situations don't need more than one. Tha rest? Heaven ferbid, Ah might spend a whole
quarter second jammin' two more in there."
Rockett Rimjob:
"...Mmn. Hope y'all never git in a situation yew realize luggin' a loaded spare iron's faster
than reloadin' when a huge fuckin' mass o' muscle an' fur's chargin' at y-"
Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien stopped herself.
"Eh, um, righ'. Think Ah'm gunna need anuther beer."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Ah got another one'a these. Somewhere."Rockett Rimjob:
"Think Ah left it in mah shack in Salt Lake City."
"...don't go there too often. Mormons usually don't take too kind ta me."

Rockett Rimjob chuckles, at that.
"Dunnaw, yew dun' smite lil' Nephi there like an archangel woulda."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien put the shotgun away and motioned at the waitress to get her another beer.
"Ah'll hav'ta catch up with Pastor Creely. If he's even Pastor anymore."Rockett Rimjob:
"That's a fun story."
"Y'all wanna tell it?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien grinned.
"You ever seen an entire town get turned upside down by a pretty little thang in cowboy boots
an' a shoulder-slip?"
Rockett Rimjob:
"Eeeenope?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Well. Little place called Castle Rock. Tiny town, not more'n a hunnerd people, or so. Real cute,
simple. Not far from Salt Lake."
Rockett Rimjob:
"Ah stroll in there on mah way east. Don't got no waterin' hole, since it's an awfully devout place, so Ah head to
tha barber's. Figger Ah might as well trim up."
"Have a nice conversation with a well-dressed gennleman as he's gettin' 'is 'stache all nice an' pretty. Push came
ta shove, he enned up payin' me a king's ransom an' pullin' me ta his home."
"Now, in places like Castle Rock, somebody's eyes are always watchin' -- ain't no doubt there're pryin' eyes 'round
ev'ry corner, with such a tiny community. Ah was used ta it. Don't mind tha attention, neither."
"What Ah didn't know was that Ah jus' bagged tha Pastor."
"Tha married pastor with kids who was also tha effective mayor an' de facto sheriff."
"Th' whole package, huh?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Oh you bet."Rockett Rimjob:
"You could guess 'bout how happy tha whole town was when word got 'round. Didn't take long for ev'ry set 'f ears
ta hear bout Creely an' 'is adventures while his wife was in Salt Lake."
"Ah snuck out tha back window when tha mob came ta his front door."
"Serves him righ' fer thinkin' wit' his pecker!"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Guess it does. Felt kinda sorry. If Ah'da known who he was, even Ah woulda told 'em ta
reconsider. But Ah'd only rolled inta town that afternoon."
Rockett Rimjob:
"Found out later that he was kicked outta town. Not sure what happened ta Castle Rock since then, but Ah think
they're unner new management."
"Might stop by with a duster an' some overalls one day, jus' ta see."
"Y'all got meh curious. Ah wanna see tha'!"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Well. Ain't too sure if we're headed that way, but if we do..."Rockett Rimjob:
"...Then it woulda be a nice sidetrack ta git distracted by."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...maybe do it again. Fer kicks."Rockett Rimjob:
Cassie-May O'Brien snorted into her coffee.

"Yer incorrigible."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"'S mah middle name."Rockett Rimjob:
"Papa tried fixin' me. An' Ah tried bein' reasonable."
"Didn' werk out?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Rockett Rimjob leans back, and kicks her ruby red kickers onto the table.
"Didn't take to it, naw."Rockett Rimjob:
"Well, s- ooh. There's Whitney. Oi! Whitney!"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien waved to the newcomer.
"..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen walks slowly towards the two, each step falling heavy on the wood flooring
Rockett Rimjob smiles, thinking about the conversation she just had, and then turns to face this Whitney
character.
Rockett Rimjob 's face immediately deflates.
"Howdy, sugercube."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien blinks.
Cassie-May O'Brien blink blinks.
Rockett Rimjob is leaning back, in her scanty dress, red boots on the table, smelling of alcohol, tobacco,
and sex.
"Hello Cassie..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Cassie-May O'Brien looks between the two.
"And hello to you Judy."Whitney G. Elieen:
"..."Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob stands up.
'...Judy?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"It has been a long while...but I could never forget that face of yours."Whitney G. Elieen:
"How tha hell'd you find me? And--And don't call me Judy," she barks. Her happy demeanor she
held a moment before is all but gone, replaced with some sort of long-seething anger.
Rockett Rimjob:
"I did not find you."Whitney G. Elieen:
".....Sssssso Ah guess yew two know each other already."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I did not seek you, though you have been in my prayers for a very long time."Whitney G. Elieen:
Rockett Rimjob turns to Cassie.

https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 308/791
Cassie-May O'Brien looks confused and alert.
Rockett Rimjob chops at her neck with one of her hands. Seems she wants Cass to clam it.
"I ask God every other night where you might be...her response is always the same."Whitney G. Elieen:
Cassie-May O'Brien blinks.
Rockett Rimjob turns back to look at Whitney.
Cassie-May O'Brien slooowly brings the coffee mug to her lips and takes a sip, watching the scene.
"Ah wish Ah got popcorn."(From Cassie-May O'Brien):
"Right. Lettin' God solve all yer problems. Uh-huh."Rockett Rimjob:
"You better not be here ta goad me inta headin' home. Ain't happenin'."
"Aiiiin't happenin'."
"She is the supreme problem solver."Whitney G. Elieen:
Rockett Rimjob wags a finger.
"And no. Not at all."Whitney G. Elieen:
"There is no home to go back to but the one up in heaven."
Rockett Rimjob rolls her eyes.
"They are gone."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Ah heard."Rockett Rimjob:
"Mother and father. Ascended. I have seen it with my own eyes. I did not see you however."Whitney G. Elieen:
"I knew you were out here somewhere...I have tried to find you. The last time we spoke..."
Rockett Rimjob bites one of her cheeks.
Whitney G. Elieen lifts her hair up a bit, so as to show a rather nasty scar.
"You did this."Whitney G. Elieen:
"..."Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob grits her teeth.
Cassie-May O'Brien put the mug back on the table with a clunk louder than intended.
"Ain't a mite close ta what Ah came ta you with."Rockett Rimjob:
Whitney G. Elieen sets the hair down
"An' if ya woulda cut tha googly Adventist hoo-hah fer five seconds Ah'd still be able ta read a
damn book."
Rockett Rimjob:
"Fuckin' bitch."
"Your anger is understandable."Whitney G. Elieen:
Rockett Rimjob spits onto Whitney's shoes, then she starts angrily digging into her pocket.

"Father did so many terrible things...misguided. Born of love but expressed in such a terrible
way."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Born o' love mah sorry ass."Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob slaps a bill down on the table and flicks it over to the discarded beer bottles.
"..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Rockett Rimjob looks at Cass.
"She ain't fuckin' with you, is she?"Rockett Rimjob:
"You marshals?"
"...Now, simmer down a bit, y'all."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien held her hands up.
"Ah got no idea y'all know each other up to now so don'cha unload whutever is between
yew two on meh."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
Whitney G. Elieen looks on in silence
"She is right you know"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Do not burden strangers with asylum. I am right here...and now that I have found you I am not going anywhere."
Cassie-May O'Brien swung her legs over the seat and stood up.
"Ta hell you ain't. Ah ain't gonna spend five more seconds around you."Rockett Rimjob:
"Ah'll simmer down when Ah'm six feet under."
"You can't run from me forever Judy..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"..."
Rockett Rimjob pulls a cigar from her satchel, as well as a match, and proceeds to try and light the damn
thing up with desperation and anger.
"Don't fuckin' call me that!"Rockett Rimjob:
"An' you don't breathe a word of this!" she says, giving Cass a rather rude pointing-to before hurrying her way to
the stairs.
"...uh...?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien scratched her neck in confusion.
Rockett Rimjob puff puff puff
"..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"I am sorry you had to hear this."
Rockett Rimjob puffs FURIOUSLY
Rockett Rimjob closes the door behind her after a giant puff of smoke
"God bless you child, you could not have foreseen this reunion."Whitney G. Elieen:

Cassie-May O'Brien turns to Whitney.
"Whut the fuck did Ah jus' witness."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Yer sisters?"
"Yes"Whitney G. Elieen:
"We are."
"Judy Elieen. Daughter of James and Bethany Elieen."
"She goes by another name now it seems."
"...Fits 'er better, truth be told."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien retrieved her coffee mug.
(lmao)Rockett Rimjob:
"...So, lemme guess an' correct me if Ah'm wrong here."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien took a sip.
"Yer sisters."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Yes this is true."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Yer wuz yer dad's favourite while Rockett 'ere wuz at odds wit' him."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Dad beat me all the same. But less so. At the time faith, to me, was a way to live in peace."Whitney G. Elieen:
"So, yew ran ta God while she ran away."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"After throwing a rock at my head"Whitney G. Elieen:
"And sending me into a two week long coma"
"Ah wuz' meanin' ta ask fer th' scar."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Why'd she throw tha' rock? Wait... Yew tried ta stop her?"
"Or defend yer father?"
"She came to me, crying...asking for support. I was flawed. Callous even. It was not that I did
not care but I was...unsure of how to help her."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Tha' explains how angry she wuz."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I tried to tell her how I get by. But I said it in a way that only pushed her away."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Mmm. Mighta wanted ta open wit' tha' instead of tellin' how God crossed yer paths. Mahbe
followed by "Ah'm sawrry Ah failed yew as a sister" or sumthin'..."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien sipped her coffee, then realized that her mug is dry with a groan.
"But God did cross our paths."Whitney G. Elieen:
"She said so herself."
"She doesn' really seem ta care too much 'bout displays of piety, sugercube."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...Ssso, whut 'bout tha' ascension?"

"Mother and father are in heaven. I know this because I have seen it myself."Whitney G. Elieen:
"When I awoke from my coma after receiving my commandment...they were gone. Vanished."
"...Whuh?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I did not see my sister however. I have been told from the highest of authorities that she was
roaming the earth."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Lost and astray..."
"...Did yew see th' exact moment of yer parents flyin' up ta heaven in light an' glory?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"They were there when I arrived."Whitney G. Elieen:
"It seemed like an instant...I was not aware it had been two weeks."
"...Ssso yew did? Or didn't?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I didn't, no. They seemed to be already there when I arrived."Whitney G. Elieen:
"So, all yew did actually see is, yer parents are there, rock, yer parents aren't there two
weeks later."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Yes...why do you suspect something?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Time in heaven works differently than time here."
"Sugercube, yew ain' gunna like whut Ah gotta say, but from mah experience, a man thaCassie-May O'Brien:
is beatin' his kids so hard tha' one runs away from home ta become a hooker ain' got no chariot-ride ta heaven in
glory."
"In those two weeks...anything could happen. The beauty of God's grace is that it applies to
each and every one of us. It is our gift. Regardless of whether we deserve it. Forgiveness is ours if we so seek it."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Perhaps in those two weeks...he finally did."
"...So, Whitney, y'all seekin' Rockett's fergiveness, or th' other way 'round?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"It is especially hard for the pious to find salvation, believe it or not. The sick can only be
healed if they seek a doctor. I feel the experience of losing me and his other daughter may have set him on the
right path."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"I am seeking her own of course. She may have thrown a stone at me...but I hold no ill will towards that."
"I was wrong. Father was wrong. I want to try and make it right."
"...Welp. Y'all stay here an' think on yer phrasing, then, an' Ah'm gunna go talk ta her."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien patted Whitney's arm, smiled and turned to the stairs.
"..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen goes over to the table, kneels down and prays...
Cassie-May O'Brien stares
"..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...Eeeeeyup. Y'all wanna keep them displays o' piety ta minimum, sugercube. Preferableh sittin' instead of
kneelin', too."
"..."

Cassie-May O'Brien turned to the stairs again and went to find the door Rockett disappeared behind.
The door to her room is wide open.Rockett Rimjob:
"Rockett? Y'all 'ere? 'S me, Cassie!"Cassie-May O'Brien:
She is not in her room, howeverRockett Rimjob:
Whitney G. Elieen does not respond. Rather she keeps her eyes closed tight in silent prayer...
"..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien peers into Rockett's room. Any open windows, signs of quick packing?
Nope. Stuff's just as it would be.Rockett Rimjob:
You do however hear some creaking floorboards just down the hall.
Cassie-May O'Brien turns to look
As well as some muffled moaning.Rockett Rimjob:
"..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien walked over to the source of the sounds.
A locked door to one of the rooms.Rockett Rimjob:
What do you think is happening?
Cassie-May O'Brien presses her ear to the door.
"...Mmmeeeeyup."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien pulls back and puts her hands on her hips.
"..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...Rrrrrrright."
"...Nnnh... Nnh, damn you got good aim..."Rockett Rimjob:
"--Ah! Ah, easy, there, bronco..."
Cassie-May O'Brien turned on her heel, blushing faintly, and marched back down to the main hall.
"...Ah think 's best y'all give 'er a minute. She appears ta be fuckin'."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien sat down heavily.
"...AhCassie-May O'Brien:
am too sober fer this."
Whitney G. Elieen opens her eyes
"I see. She is trying to blow off steam...perhaps make me angry."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen unclasps her hands and starts to get up onto her feet.
"Ah think it mighta also be givin' herself tahme an' space away from yew, since it ain' like
we're gunna barge in on her doin' them bedsheet tango."
Cassie-May O'Brien:

"I will not intrude upon her den."Whitney G. Elieen:
("the more the merrier")Rockett Rimjob:
"Perhaps she will calm down enough to talk with me then."Whitney G. Elieen:
"It has been a long time...and I have missed her. She is the only family I have left on this earth, after all."
"Welp, good thing is, ain' lookin' like she's gunna bail on uh. Sounds like she's gunna be
walkin funny after whut
Cassie-May O'Brien:
is goin' on now."
Cassie-May O'Brien rubbed her neck again.
"Tha's an incredibly awkward situation."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I am sorry you had to be caught in the middle of it."Whitney G. Elieen:
"God's plan is mysterious...perhaps there was a good reason why I was not told where she was. I can only guess
at the divine."
"...Ah ain', actually. Looks like yew two gunna have a mighty need fer a pious ta fuck you
translator."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...a translator. That is a good word for it."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Through God the power of tongues are of little concern. But for me...?"
Whitney G. Elieen shakes her head
"When it comes to her it feels we are almost from completely different worlds."Whitney G. Elieen:
"...Weird how thut goes, huh..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...I don't much care for it."Whitney G. Elieen:
"I want to set things right and atone for my failure."
"I want her to join me in heaven."
"...Heaven. Righ'."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien rubbed the mark on her hand.
"...if only she had seen what I have seen..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Whut did y'all see?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"They say the streets of heaven are paved in Gold...I tell you this. Those are the most
mundane of it's wonders."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"So yer sayin' yew saw Heaven while in coma?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"To even begin to describe it feels almost impossible...paradise. Beyond all imagining. The
Garden, the palace..."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Yes."
"...Huh. Neat."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Yes...very neat."Whitney G. Elieen:

"...God will be coming soon."
Cassie-May O'Brien turned her head to the stairs.
"The end times are coming. I want to save as many as I can...each and every soul I save
means the world to me. But my sister..."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Ah'm pretty sure tha' ain' God in there wit' Rockett, but y'all mighta be right 'bout that."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...Oh. Yew meant like the Rapture."
"Yes. The second coming of Christ."Whitney G. Elieen:
"She is coming for her children."
"Wuzn' Jesus a man?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"To set the evil of the world right and to make us whole again. So it says in the bible and so it
was said to me."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"God the son? Yes."
"God the father is far more incomprehensable however."
"Even more so as God the son and God the father are one and the same."
"It is easy for us to think of God through the limited human lens. She is far more then we could ever hope to
imagine. I should know...I did see her. A glimpse at least."
"In the blinding light of heaven."
"Sugercube, Ah'm gunna be honest. IF it wuz anyun' else, Ah'd take all tha' as buncha
crazy patootee from brain trauma. But Ah saw yew heal wounds wit' yer touch."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...yes. I am well aware of how I sound."Whitney G. Elieen:
"How unbelievable it is."
"But I have seen it myself...and I have seen the wonders God is capable of."
(I'M ALIVE)Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"Again...Ah saw yew heal wounds wit' a touch."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...siddawn wit' meh. Ah'll git us somethin' ta drink."
"Thank you..."Whitney G. Elieen:

"A water for me please."Whitney G. Elieen:

How else is she going to hold those tits up Varmus?
jokes aside, Strength is basically only used for melee damage.Cassie-May O'Brien:
Probably a good thing to consider, because she's going to be an up close fighter,
when she does fight.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Unless you plan to bitchslap people left and right, it's somewhat wasted.Cassie-May O'Brien:
4d10 Nimble, melee fightin', and also she needs strength for her gunRockett Rimjob:

so VigorRockett Rimjob:
what's the deal with taking damage and having to succeed a roll or somethign
okay, the damage is basically divided into two partsdimVitrarius:
actual damage to your body parts, and Wind
Damage to body parts (arms, legs, guts, head) goes on a 1 to 5 scale.
It is the serious bad bad thing.
>Deceptively butch like her sisterWhitney G. Elieen:
That is actually a very apt way to put it

"but whitney's just a fatty"Rockett Rimjob:
Wind is the sorta kinda nonlethal damagedimVitrarius:
it's equal to your Spirit and Vigor dice combined
plus extras
I seeRockett Rimjob:
as in number of dice or dice type
Another thing to consider is SizedimVitrarius:
Dice type
o okRockett Rimjob:
so 16 is ok?
or
yeah, especially since you might later get it betterdimVitrarius:
it's not that important actually
o okRockett Rimjob:
actual wounds are worsedimVitrarius:
also it'd be great to have Nev here becaus he knows this system inside out
anyway
Size
generally when you take actual damage, you compare it to the Size of your character
for every full increment, you get 1 point of wound
so if you got Size 6 and got rolled, say, 19 damage, it means 19/6 => 3 woundsdimVitrarius:
there are perks to make you bigger or smaller
smaller is bad because it's easier to hurt you
as a frontliner you might consider taking the same perk Whitney has
but that will come later
i like it how that's a term nowRockett Rimjob:
frontliner?dimVitrarius:
yeRockett Rimjob:
so are perks the only thing that affect size
off the top of my head, yeahdimVitrarius:
another thing is armor
armor is either light or heavy
Cass got some light armor on her legs
light armor reduces amount of rolled damage you take
heavy armor reduces the amount of dice and their size

Basically, if you lack a certain skill, you can instead choose to roll the associated Trait Dice at a minimum of -4.
For instance, if an evil cultist throws some black magic at you that requires a Faith roll to resist, and you have no
faith, you would instead roll Spirit at a -4.
Let it be known that in this game, where almost all dice are Keep Highest, penalties and bonuses are really, really

I now have seven bounty points.Nevermore:
Groovy.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Oh, also.Nevermore:
Since I got y'all here.
Varmus never finished going over Wind, Stun, and Wounds.
I can do that now if y'all would like.
To make it short.
Wind is effectively how tired you are. Every time you get shot, run too hard, or use certain abilities, you take Wind
damage.
Stun is what happens whenever you get shot hard enough to take a wound, and instead of shooting
back, you spend your time cryin to mama over losing bits of your favorite anatomy.
Nevermore:
Every time you take at least a light wound, you roll a Stun resist roll. Vigor roll against a TN of 5, plus 2 for each
wound level above Light, plus wound penalty.
So, if you took a Heavy wound (Two wound levels) to the arm, you would roll Vigor against TN7 at a -2 or lose all
actions.
And you keep losing all actions until you pass.
So get dunked on.
What's MORE.
Every time you take damage, you take 1d6 wind.Nevermore:
Any damage. Of any kind.
If you take 1 point of damage you roll 1d6.
Plus 1d6 for every wound level you suffered.
What's more.
If you took a Serious or heavier wound, you suffer Bleeding.
You take 1d6 wind every round even if you pass your stun resist and other rolls.Nevermore:
And you keep taking it until you pass out.
And keep taking it after you pass out.
You can die from this.
To make a very, very long story short.

Oh, that's another thing to cover, but first, your roll.Nevermore:
So you rolled a 3. Presumably you want to move that up two points.
yeRockett Rimjob:
Which brings you up to 5, which is a shot to the lower guts, AKA the chest.Nevermore:
You want to hit the Gizzards or Noggin, because these give you bonus damage dice.
The Gizzards are at the 10, and the noggin is at the 20.
Gizzards for one bonus damage dice, Noggin for two.
Headshots also tend to be unarmored.
However, much like 6A, peeking from cover is indeed a thing.
It's ultimately the GM's decision as to whether a particular shot will be in cover or not.Nevermore:
Which is why interrupt actions are important!
how are range penalties handledRockett Rimjob:
Badly.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
You have your gun's range increment then at a -2 for everything beyond that.Nevermore:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is slumped in the nearest available seating. For reasons currently unsaid, Nephi

Also, someone help me level some stuff up?Crystal Saint Claire:
Rubs templesNevermore:
Am here, whatcha need
HmmCrystal Saint Claire:
I have...
more red chips than I can use
So I need to spend a few
Figure out how many you want to spend and I can give you suggestions.Nevermore:
3 red, 1 whiteCrystal Saint Claire:
Seven points.Nevermore:
How many did you have already?
?Crystal Saint Claire:
You can cash chips in and keep the XP and not have to immediately spend it.Nevermore:
oh. I had 3 beoreCrystal Saint Claire:
That gives you 10.Nevermore:
You can buy a three-point edge.
okCrystal Saint Claire:
Or raise two skills from rank 0 to rank 5Nevermore:
...Crystal Saint Claire:
That means I spend 5 dice?
Shotgun going to 5
for reasons
It takes one point for each level of skill from 1-5.Nevermore:
...Actually, hang on.
My B.
It is one point for every level of aptitude.
So, going from a 3 to a 4 costs 4 points.
You could bring a skill up to 4 from 0 with ten points.

Is she working on anything today?
She is.Crystal Saint Claire:
And she has not eaten since breakfast.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano turns up!
Yesterday.Crystal Saint Claire:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano turns up with a hot can of pork and beans.
"Ey. Crystal?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...Hello, Delano."Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire is a little pale, and a little sleepy-looking, but awake enough to recognize him.
"I think I've almost got this figured out!"Crystal Saint Claire:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano puts the can in front of her nose.
"Ya haven't eaten since... Darned if I know."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Chow down."
"What's in the can?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Pork and beans."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Would you like the pork bits?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"...You don't eat pork?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Whitney says I'm not supposed to eat them"Crystal Saint Claire:
"...Aw heck, you ain't buyin into her whole Adventist stuff, are ya?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"If I try to copy her nutritional intake..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Maybe I'll get bigger, too..."
Crystal Saint Claire looks down...
"Meat's good for kids, Crystal."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I was always last to the table, and look at me. Skinny as a rail no matter how much I eat."
"Technically the protein from meat can be substituted from legumes"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Sorry, from beans."
"Sure it can."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Don't help any with the gas."
"Dernit, I know what a legume is! It's like, a peanut, right?"
"I never had that issue..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Peanuts are a form of legume, yes."

"...Course, I only know from those couple weeks I spent on a plantation..."
"The point is that I am trying not to eat meat for a bit, to see if it works."Crystal Saint Claire:
"I dunno about you, but I think Whitney's got some other secret than diet to why she's
bigger'n a Steam Wagon."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Well, there's also her excercise regimen, but diet is integral to any exercise plan. It is
possible her ancestry took a role in her size..."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"But I would like to believe there is a way I can get bigger."
"Even if the doctors say I can't."
"Well, I always got along well with the doctors, so... I dunno. They're usually right bout
this kinda thing, I figger."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Besides, yer still a kid. You got growin to do, right?"
"I kept growin til about a year ago, myself."
"I... am different."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Naw."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Yer just like us, Crystal."
"A right friendly weirdo."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano smirks.
"Biologically speaking."Crystal Saint Claire:
"The production of chemicals in my body that cause the growth typically associated with children my age has been
slowed, if not halted."
"...In ah, smaller words?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano thinks for a minute.

It is a late night at the Kansas City Hotel. Most of the patrons have gone to their
rooms. Most of them have partaken of good food, good drink, and will soon partake of good company. There are a
few left on the ground floor. The waiters and some peculiar new folk stay up to drink and chat as the moon cools
the dry earth.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Crystal Saint Claire yawns and stretches, looking around to remember where she fell asleep this time.
Upon realizing she's in secluded corner of a public space, she gathers her things close and looks for an
exit. Fortunately, she spots a more appealing option: Whitney!
Crystal Saint Claire waves like a little spaz.
Whitney G. Elieen looks over from her cup of cold water and smiles right back.
Whitney G. Elieen waves and motions for her much smaller friend to come.
Cassie-May O'Brien blinks and turns to where Whitney's smiling.
"...Crystal? How long were you here?"Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Of course I have~ I am in need of the company of friends. Cassie was so kind as to provide
this for me, but your presence is...-"
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Oh Crystal!"
"Why would I ever be angry with you over that?"
"...because my hand was between your breasts for a considerable period of time."Crystal Saint Claire:

"I uh-
"Whut."
"Whut did Ah miss."
"And I impersonated Christ when confrontedCrystal Saint Claire:
"And you are sorry for impersonating the Lord? Have you prayed for forgiveness?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"And yes...for clarity she was hoping to suprise me with a gift! The gift of armor to be exact."
"She needed my measurements."
"I am... and did... You were there."Crystal Saint Claire:
Whitney G. Elieen smiles even wider
"Also, I finished the armor..."Crystal Saint Claire:

"Indeed. The result of a male dominated culture which helped to shape our earthly church.
Paltry when compared to the true majesty of God."

Cassie-May O'Brien shrugged.
(I will do no such thing. If I assume you are a step behind, I will be pleasantly surprised.)Crystal Saint Claire:
(Or, better still, I will be right.)
"I had the good fortune of seeing and speaking with her myself. You would be surprised. Far
from the vision of an earthly middle aged man with greying hair."

(Have you been right so far?)Wonderful Cowboy Land:
(Once, maybe twice.)Crystal Saint Claire:
"If we meet any ranking officials of the church... I feel they may not appreciate this conversation."
"Indeed. For God the father is vast and powerful. What resides in between is...an interesting
speculation. But meaningless to her true message."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"And I would not be the first who ran afoul of the Pharisee"
"Jesus in his time was quite the rebel. He spoke the truth of God's love and was hated for it."
"Ah liked tha' part when he grabbed a rope an' went an' smacked merchants outta church."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...But Jesus got back up after they killed him. I do not want to test if you are similarly...
endowed."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"Matthew 21-12. I always enjoyed that one. It shows a more human Jesus, who was so
frustrated by the perversion of God's message that he had to grab a rope and lead them out."
Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen squeezes, though only slightly so
"Do not worry Crystal...I can't speak for God's plan but I can guess she has more in store for
me yet. I am not going anywhere..."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"...I hope not..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Otherwise, I... am still confident I will be consigned to oblivion..."
"You are already walking the right path Crystal. God loves you. And so do I."Whitney G. Elieen:

"Eeeyup..."Cassie-May O'Brien:

Actually...
"...So how wuz yer childhood like, Whitney?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...it was not perfect. Father was strict. Mother had little voice. The children used to mock me
for being so large..."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"I took respite in God though I harbored resentment in my heart toward her for making me stand out so."
"Realleh naw..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Y'all got any other siblings?"
"Aside from Judy? No. She is my only sister."Whitney G. Elieen:
"No other fam'leh? Jus' yew two now?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Just us. On this earth."Whitney G. Elieen:
"If I had any other family I am not aware of them."
"Mmmmeeyup. Also, sugercube... Y'all realleh wanna use th' name Rockett wit' her, Ah
think."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...I shall refer to her as my sister. No more. No less."Whitney G. Elieen:
"I will avoid her true name. Around her."
"Guess tha's an acceptable compromise."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Indeed..."Whitney G. Elieen:

"If this is what it takes."
"God suggested that I meet her half way. You speak the advice of the divine."
"Perhaps I will buy her...a drink. That too was suggested."
"...Guess tha's anuther name fer common sense, hyuk."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"An' tha's a gewd idea. Alcoholic one."
"Far too many have falling prey to the drink. It has robbed them of their better senses, it adds
unnecessary weight and it puts a strain upon the liver."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"But one beer so that my sister may talk with me is acceptable."
"Sure does."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien said flatly, staring at Whitney and guzzling down the remaining half of her beer bottle
in defiance.
Whitney G. Elieen tilts her head and frowns
"Brrueerk."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Pardon."
Poage is still facedown.
*Crystal Saint Claire:
"God bless."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen pulls Crystal close
"Sure he does!"Cassie-May O'Brien:
I am on mobile. Please bear with.Nevermore:
Cassie-May O'Brien put the empty bottle back on the table and grinned.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads over to the others.
Whitney G. Elieen sips at her water
Crystal Saint Claire is pulled towards Whitney
Cassie-May O'Brien scratches her head
Crystal Saint Claire is mumbling something
"I wonder...how does it taste?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Whut, beer?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I have never had a drink before. I do not plan on it either!"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Yes. That."

"...what's going on?"
"Ain' a bad taste either. Welp, actually, dependinCassie-May O'Brien:

"Howdy, Nephi. Discussin' th' tase o' beer at th' moment. Waitin' fer Rockett ta git done wit' her client, 'cuz Ah gotta

"Ah mean she's fuckin'."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Do ya have ta put it like that?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Whut? Is how it is."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"She does speak the truth..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"...Ah really dont wanna have this conversation right now."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...so. Any of you play cards?"
"Ain' got cash fer bettin'. 'Specially now thut Ah bought all tha' beer."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I do not. I am sorry."Whitney G. Elieen:
"I try to avoid games of chance, and all things associated with them." She says, blissfully unaware that she is, in
fact, in a chance based rp.
Cassie-May O'Brien looks up at the screen
"...what's gotten into you both?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...got a weird feelin' there."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Whuddya mean, Nephi?"
"...Ehh."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Speak freely Nephi."Whitney G. Elieen:
"What troubles you, son of Joseph?"
"Probably noyhing."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Cassie-May O'Brien shrugged.
"In the meantime, we still heading to Dodge City?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"...Guess tha's mah cue."Cassie-May O'Brien:
(off to a great start)Rockett Rimjob:
Cassie-May O'Brien stood up from the table...
Rockett Rimjob is quite ragged, her bonnet skewed to one side and bent, hair a mess over her bare
shoulders. Her dress is disheveled, and her countenance worn but... still angry, somehow/ You can smell
her sin from halfway across the room.
"...Howdy again."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien sashayed close.

Rockett Rimjob tries her best to fix herself, but really her minimal effort does next to nothing to make her
look any less of a mess.
"What?"Rockett Rimjob:
"...Welp, sugercube. Thought Ah coulda grab a small talk wit' yew before y'all go do
whutever yer plannin' ta do."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien put her hands on her hips and shifted her weight on one leg.
"Sounds like brown-nosin'. Ah think Ah'll pass 'til t'morrow, sugar."Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob sounds irate.
"Eeenope. Jus' talked ta Whitney an', ta translate from her language ta ours, she's real
sorry she's been a shit sister fer yew an' wants ta somehow fix tha'."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
1/20/2018 Chat Log for Wonderful Cowboy Adventure Land
https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 354/791
Cassie-May O'Brien shifted her weight to the other leg.
"On one hand, ain' mah business, on th' other, Ah try ta care fer mah friends, an' yer un'."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Neat."Rockett Rimjob:
"Now if you'll excuse me."
Rockett Rimjob motions for Cass to scoot her boot.
Rockett Rimjob clearly does not give a single fuck about Whitney's wants.
"Look, sugercube. Ain' gonna knock yer heads tagether an' make yew kiss, but... yer both
th' only famileh yew have left. Mahbe it's werth it ta at least hear whut she has ta say ta yew before y'all blow her
off."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien moved aside to let Rockett pass.
"Angry as yew are at her, an' wit' good reason."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"She's as much family ta me as a cow is to a horse. Ain't a chance in hell Ah'm givin' her tha
time'a day if Ah don't gotta."
Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob shimmies her britches back up to her waist, gets them comfortable, and starts marching
onward.
"Wit' how yew two stubborn are, Ah'd guess yer both mules."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"..."Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob clenches her fist. "Damn right Ah'm stubborn. Ah got it from pa. Sure Whitney already told
you all about that, didn't she?"
"Ah think yer in th' right 'bout all tha', yew know!"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien put her hands on her hips.
"An' Ah am takin' yer side, so mahbe go dunk tha' head in water ta cool off so yew can think
straight!"
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Ah'll dunk yer fuckin' head, just you wait," she grumbles under her breath as she heads out the
door.
Rockett Rimjob:
"Have it yer way. Guess yer ain' gunna be goin' ta meet Doc Mitchell if yer hatin's more
important than gittin' whoever killed her friend ta justice."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...awkay, show's over. Pack up, we're leavin'."
"Ah am prett-ay sure tha' she's gunna go ta Dodge alone naw jus' ta spite erryun' an' deal wit' Doc Mitchell on 'er
own."

Crystal Saint Claire looks up from her arms.
"Was that her?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Eeeeyup."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Ah'm serious, git yer asses up now. If she ain' back through tha' door in ten minutes, means she's already left."

Crystal Saint Claire sighs.
"Where do you think she would be..? If she has not left."Crystal Saint Claire:
"...How would Ah know?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Yew two are gunna keep sittin'?"
"I did not ask where you knew she would be, O'Brien."Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire stands. She actually gets a bit shorter, standing.
"I asked for a guess."Crystal Saint Claire:
"I... sort of want to try talking to her."
Cassie-May O'Brien blink blinked, then spread her arms.
"How the fuck would Ah know? Ah don't know this city or where her favourite spots are,
Crystal."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
You hear an incredibly loud gunshot in the distance.Rockett Rimjob:
"...I think I can guess now."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Tha's her."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Cassie-May O'Brien ran out in the direction of the gunshot!
"Should we be worried about that?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Crystal Saint Claire follows.
SighNephi "Longiron" Delano:
Crystal Saint Claire reaches into her bag, pulling out a little red shotshell and loading it into the Opus.
"I hope she's okay..."Crystal Saint Claire:
*brb sorryYuppie b.:
South. You head south, not far out of town, just past a cowhouse. As you get closer, you see a
bunch of bottles set up on the fence posts. One of them is quite shattered.
Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett is standing on the other side of the dirt road.
"..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...You kiddin me."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Oh, that is a relief. Target practice!"Crystal Saint Claire:
"..."
Cassie-May O'Brien pulled out her Winchester and shot down one of the bottles.
"Think yer up ta sum' competition?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Rockett Rimjob looks.

Crystal Saint Claire walks parallel to Rockett, until she's behind her, then over towards her.
"..."Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob turns to face the group.
Cassie-May O'Brien puts the rifle on her shoulder and pushes her stetson up a bit.
Rockett Rimjob looks at Crystal as she moves.
"...y'all ain't gonna let this go, are ya."Rockett Rimjob:
"...can you teach me to shoot? I have a gun, but... Little skill using it."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Not with this thang."Rockett Rimjob:
"Sug, Ah told yew, Ah ain' gunna bonk yer heads tagether an' make yew kiss. But Whitney's
goin' ta Dodge wit'us, so if yer wantin' ta go wit' us, yer gunna have ta grit yer teeth an' bear her company. An' if
yer already doin' tha', yew mighta as well shorten yerself the bullshit an' have her talk, if onleh ta let 'er say she
tried, an' tell he ta fuck off fer good. Sure beats gettin' holy bible quoted at yew ev'ry five minutes."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
Rockett Rimjob has an oversized, fancy-ass derringer dangling in her hand, pointed at the ground.
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire stares at the weapon.
Cassie-May O'Brien lowered her rifle and loaded a new bullet into the mag.
"...tell ya what."Rockett Rimjob:
"You hit a bottle with this piece o' mine, an' maybe Ah'll give ya tha time'a day," she says, staring at Cass.
Cassie-May O'Brien blink-blinked.
"...Fahne."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien has a wiry frame and thin wrists. She ain't gonna have hands after shooting this thing
barring a miracle.
Rockett Rimjob cracks her derringer open, and pulls out the lone shell loaded inside. Then, she pulls a
bullet out of her pocket. Said bullet is three inches long and some change.
Cassie-May O'Brien seems to realize that, given the look on her face.
It's not too much smaller than the bullets used in Nephi's rifle, for reference.Rockett Rimjob:
"That is a large Derringer..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Who made it?"
"Bond Arms. Houston."Rockett Rimjob:
Cassie-May O'Brien extended her hand to Rockett for the derringer.
'..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Crystal Saint Claire doesn't seem to understand the vibe of this situation...
1/20/2018 Chat Log for Wonderful Cowboy Adventure Land
https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 357/791
Rockett Rimjob twirls it around a bit for kicks, then holds it out to Cass.
Rockett Rimjob holds out the bullet with her other hand.
"Do you have schematics? Anything? It looks fascinating..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Can't say Ah do."Rockett Rimjob:
Cassie-May O'Brien grabs it and inspects for a moment, then steels herself with a sigh.
"...May I take a look at it later?"Crystal Saint Claire:
Cassie-May O'Brien turns to the bottles.
"Long as ya don't take it apart.Rockett Rimjob:
"...Would you like to see mine?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Cass, use both hands. Grip tha everlovin' hell out of it, too, ya string bean."Rockett Rimjob:
Cassie-May O'Brien tries to steady and secure the little hellion as tightly as she can in the bend of her
other arm.
Cassie-May O'Brien leans forward on her legs, hoping to take at least some of the recoil into shifting her
weight back.
Cassie-May O'Brien takes careful aim at the bottle...
BANG!!!Cassie-May O'Brien:
Rockett Rimjob smiles
Doc, what should I roll again?Cassie-May O'Brien:
First it's a Strength roll, target 8. Then it's a Shootin' roll for Pistols.Rockett Rimjob:
Unless Doc wants to be mean.
Doc is busy trick-or-treating, though.

Crystal Saint Claire looks at Cassie for a few seconds... then to Rockett...
"...Tha'... went 'bout as well as Ah thought..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien sucks a breath of air through her clenched teeth, holding tightly her broken wrist. At
least she didn't drop the gun.

Rockett Rimjob looks at the bottle.
Crystal Saint Claire takes a deep breath.

"Wwwwwooo fuckin' hoo."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Crystal Saint Claire starts digging through her bag.
Cassie-May O'Brien hissed.
Cassie-May O'Brien grabbed the derringer with her other hand and held it out to Rockett, her right wrist
obviously broken.
Rockett Rimjob takes it.
"Y'wanna talk 'bout this while we head out ta meet Doc Mitchell?"Rockett Rimjob:
"Ah think yer gonna need 'em."
Cassie-May O'Brien took a look at her wrist.
"..."Poage:
Rockett Rimjob seems to be at least vaguely familiar with this situation.
"I think I might be able to help with that defect..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Maybe some sort of brace, or... Anything really."0

Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien hissed again through her teeth.
"...Let's git back ta th' hotel. Ah think Whitney's still in there."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"To be fair, the recoil is likely-- oh! Whitney can fix your hand, Miss O'Brien!"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Tha's whut Ah fucking hope fer, eeyup."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Remember? Like she did with the conductor's ear!"Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire doesn't look up from the gun in her hands the whole time.
Cassie-May O'Brien just bumped her hip in Rockett's ass.
"Come on, Rimjob."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Given Ah jus' willingly broke mah hand fer this, yew owe meh this much."
"..."Rockett Rimjob:
"...honestly Ah can't even be upset at that."
"That's impressive."
"Told ya, Ah try lookin' out fer mah friends."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Let's get goin', Ah suppose."Rockett Rimjob:
Cassie-May O'Brien started walking back to the hotel.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano follows the others.
Poage walks back towards the hotel, her eyes not leaving the ground the whole way.

Cassie-May O'Brien showed her completely broken right wrist.
Crystal Saint Claire sits back over here, reaches through her bag, and pulls out a little black box with a
little red pepper on it.

Whitney G. Elieen relaxes her hand
Crystal Saint Claire reaches into her bag and pulls out the Armored Vest she made for Whitney.
"Ah owe yew a favour, sugercube."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...here."Crystal Saint Claire:
Rockett Rimjob doesn't seem to be paying attention.
Cassie-May O'Brien looks over to Rockett.
Rockett Rimjob still wants nothing to do with Whitney.
"...Just... just in case."Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire is holding it out.
"...hmmm?" She looks to the armor with a smile. "The vest...it is ready?"Whitney G. Elieen:
Crystal Saint Claire nods.
"Oh Crystal...thank you so much."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen grabs it.

Whitney G. Elieen sets it down next to her
Whitney G. Elieen reaches forward and hugs
Crystal Saint Claire stiffens for a moment, then returns hugs.

"God bless you, my friend. Thank you for this mighty vestment."Whitney G. Elieen:
"P-please warn me... just... a second or two in advance..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Cassie-May O'Brien pointed on the table behind her.
"Ah think Ah've had enough drink."Rockett Rimjob:
"Is that truly so?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Or do you just not wish to drink with me around."
"It's like watching a bear come down on your head..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Cassie-May O'Brien pulled her glove off and flexed her now unbroken hand for a moment, then put the
glove back on.

"Dunnaw, sugercube. Ah think Whitney's generally shit at communicatin' wit' yew, 'cuz Ah

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Only fair I suppose...are there any other injuries that need healing?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Ah think naw."Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Ass is kinda sore, so Ah ain't sittin' fer a spell. But fahne."Rockett Rimjob:
"Cass went outta her way ta drag me in here. Ah owe 'er this much, at least."
"Don't think fer a second Ah'm doin' this fer you, Elieen."
"I never thought so to begin with Sister."Whitney G. Elieen:
Cassie-May O'Brien grabbed herself a beer.
Cassie-May O'Brien took a long swig.
"Cassie...please." She says as she produces some cash. "Buy my sister a drink. And bring
me another water if you would."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Can do."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"For what it is worth I am sorry Sister. I have been for a long time. Ever since I woke up from
the injury you gave me."

Whitney G. Elieen hands the monez
"Bless you."Whitney G. Elieen:
Cassie-May O'Brien took the cash, then walked to the bartender.
Cassie-May O'Brien returned shortly with a water for Whitney and what appeared to be whiskey on the
rocks for Rockett.
Rockett Rimjob stares flatly at Cass. "When Ah said Ah wasn't thirsty no more, Ah meant it."
Cassie-May O'Brien shrugs.
"Fair enough. Yew two mind if in that case Ah...?Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien gestured to the whiskey.
"I do not mind in the slightest."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Ain't mah whiskey."Rockett Rimjob:

Cassie-May O'Brien sipped the whiskey instead, leaning on the table.
"I know you will not listen to what I have to say but this is the truth."Whitney G. Elieen:
Rockett Rimjob stares at Whitney, arms crossed. She stays silent and waits for her to continue, not
offering a single word.
"I was callous. I was a child and I had a child's understanding."Whitney G. Elieen:
Rockett Rimjob taps one of her fingers against her covered bicep.
"I was wrong. Father was wrong. My transgressions against you pushed you away."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Maybe someday you will forgive me. But It will not stop me from trying to make it right in the meanwhile."
"You still have the scars...don't you."
"Why d'you think Ah grew mah hair out?" she says coldly.Rockett Rimjob:

Cassie-May O'Brien knocked the whiskey in one go.

Whitney G. Elieen gets up from her seat
Whitney G. Elieen walks over...standing at her full height
Rockett Rimjob takes a step back.
"Whitney please don't"Crystal Saint Claire:
Whitney G. Elieen reaches her hand over
Cassie-May O'Brien holds her out in front of Whitney.
"Please...just this once."Whitney G. Elieen:

caught mah scent you ain't gonna get off mah trail 'til one of us dies."
Rockett Rimjob:
Cassie-May O'Brien had probably no way in hell of actually stopping Whitney if she really wanted to.
"You also know that, for all my faults, I am not a liar."Whitney G. Elieen:
"And when I make a promise...I keep it. Please. Just. This. Once."
"And I will go."

"..."Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob looks at Cass.
"Yew don't have ta, Rockett."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...Ya got what ya wanned. Hope yer happy," she says, turning around and making sure her hair
is well and down before heading to the door.
Rockett Rimjob:
"Ain' no fixin' a life of fuck-ups in one evenin'."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Whitney G. Elieen steps forward
"No."Whitney G. Elieen:
"That is not what i meant."
"Yer still goin' ta Dodge w-"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Whitney G. Elieen pushes past
Cassie-May O'Brien stumbles back
"Whitney please don't!"Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire chases after
Rockett Rimjob tenses right up and clenches her fist.
"...Whoah nelly."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Let me see it."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen reaches her hand forward
Crystal Saint Claire steps between the two.
"Whitney, fer fuck's sake!"Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Crystal. Please."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Let me do this."
"It ain' yer decision ta make whut Rockett is ta do."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Whitney... Right now, she is... going through a lot. She has probably spent... a long time...
thinking about what to do. If you asked... something like this. Or something similar, how this meeting would go,
what could happen..."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"No it is not. I am not forcing you...but you know I will not leave you alone until then."Whitney G. Elieen:
"What could go wrong."Crystal Saint Claire:
"I understand. Entirely."Whitney G. Elieen:
"No. Yer gunna leave her alone now, Whitney. Ah didn' break mah hand fer this jus' so yew
dunno where ta stop an' fold. Yew ain' fixin tha' in one evening."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...I don't know what happened, but sometimes, the best way to move forward is to step
back for a bit."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"I am trying to make the one and only step I can make to making this right."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Please... just let her walk away. Let her win this."Crystal Saint Claire:
Rockett Rimjob is still facing away, looking over her shoulder.
"Please you two."Whitney G. Elieen:
"No, yer once again forcin' her ta do somethin' she doesn' want ta, an' not listenin' ta her."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"This is the endgame, and you're trying to bring it about too early!"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Sit the fuck down."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"A single touch is all I want. It is all I need."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Do you even understand what it is I am trying to do?"
"But it's now what she wants, or what she needs! Right now, you're being selfish!"Crystal Saint Claire:
"And whut 'bout whiut she wants an' needs?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Please... just..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire sits.
"...please. you're scaring me..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Ah'm gonna step through this door."Rockett Rimjob:
"An' if you follow me a step further, yer gonna regret it."
"She ain' gunna unless through me. Go, Rockett. We're leavin' tomorrow at mornin' ta
Dodge, if yew wana come."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien positions herself between the two.

"Sister. I am asking you. Just this once."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Ah asked you once."Rockett Rimjob:
"...that you did."Whitney G. Elieen:
"...I am going to let you go. But I am not going to give up. You know in your heart of hearts that there are two ways
to get rid of me."
(one sec)Rockett Rimjob:
Whitney G. Elieen turns away, but does not walk away
Crystal Saint Claire moves a little closer to Whitney.
Cassie-May O'Brien still tries to shield Rockett with her own body.
Cassie-May O'Brien realizes that both women could probably tie her into a pretzel if needed.
Cassie-May O'Brien does her best not to smile at the ridiculousness of it.
Crystal Saint Claire just silently reaches towards Whitney's hand.

Rockett Rimjob pulls her on out of the bar.
"Yer comin' with me."Rockett Rimjob:
"...uk, okay?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Rockett Rimjob yoinks
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"...ain' like Ah got a choice there..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Whitney G. Elieen casts her eyes to the floor
Whitney G. Elieen turns back around and walks to the table
Cassie-May O'Brien waved the others goodbye sheepishly
Rockett Rimjob heads back out to where she was, letting go of Cass a few steps out the door.
Whitney G. Elieen sits down
Crystal Saint Claire follows Whitney
Whitney G. Elieen clasps her hands together
"...Ssso, uh..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Whitney G. Elieen closes her eyes and bows her head
"Tha' went better than Ah expected."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Crystal Saint Claire sits, her face resting on her arms once more.
"Ah jus' about punched her ass out."Rockett Rimjob:
"This close."
"This fuckin' close."
Rockett Rimjob holds out her thumb and index finger, about a centimeter apart.
Crystal Saint Claire is mumbling something.
"Lord...lend your hand to mine...let your words flow through me and give me the strength and
wisdom to reach her..."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"...Mmmeeeyup. Am Ah gunna git punched instead here, or...?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"How do I reach out? What do I say? What do I do?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Grit yer teeth."Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob winds up.
Rockett Rimjob thrusts her whole body--!

Cassie-May O'Brien grits
Rockett Rimjob stops her fist a few inches away from Cassie's face.
Cassie-May O'Brien didn't flinch. Too much.
"...much as Ah wanna punch somethin' right now."Rockett Rimjob:
"Ain't gonna punch you."
"God...give me a sign. I am so lost..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Rockett Rimjob unclenches her fist, and reaches out to give Cassie a light, toying slap on her cheek
before walking on.
Whitney G. Elieen looks up to the celling
"...Gewd, woulda prob'ly take mah head off mah should- urk?Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien blink-blinked.
Cassie-May O'Brien rubbed her cheek, confused.
"..So, means yer comin' ta Dodge wit' us, or...?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
It was hardly a slap. If there was any pain at all, it was gone in an instant.Rockett Rimjob:
"How do I reach her? How do I save her? How do I even speak with her?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Yeah. Ah got a score ta settle with Mitchell, so either way."Rockett Rimjob:
(not a rub-away-pain thing, just a confused-rub)Cassie-May O'Brien:
Crystal Saint Claire finishes mumbling.
"...Welp, told yew when we leave. Ah'm glad, truth be told."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Crystal Saint Claire sort of just... leans over to her left, slumping towards Whitney.
"Woulda miss seein' yer rowdy ass 'round."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Oh ye of little faith..." She says as she wraps her arms around Crystal.
Crystal Saint Claire starts mumbling something, then realizes she's mumbling.
"Jus' wait 'til Ah get an excuse ta punch some poor bastard..."Rockett Rimjob:
"If them's any left after Ah'm done shootin'!"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Have you ever tried... debate? It was something the college used to make us do.."Crystal Saint Claire:
"What is there to debate?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"...I still remember the professor heading up the classes... His name Was Cecil B.
Anaheim."

"Ev'ry now an' then Ah run across a fella that either ain't met me or don't got no respect for
women anyhow. Probly both, most cases."
Rockett Rimjob:
"I have confessed my sins. I have reached out. But I can not heal the unwilling."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Starts yappin'. Pissin' me off."Rockett Rimjob:
"Ah'm a little patient. Ah give 'em time ta cut out. But sometimes..."
"He always used to say... if it first you don't succeed, don't try again."Crystal Saint Claire:
"A doctor can do nothing if their patient will not seek them..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Change angles."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Change angles?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Explain child. You have my interest."
"...it'll probly happen at least once in these next few weeks."Rockett Rimjob:
"Jus' gunna remind yew tjaCassie-May O'Brien:

"Well... with a wall, you can just batter at one spot over and over until it breaks, or gives."Crystal Saint Claire:
technically Ah'm now a woman o' law, so try ta keep it within' reason so Ah don't gotta lie ta
stop yew outta hands o' law."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"But... arguments, people, minds are different. Subjective."Crystal Saint Claire:
"..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Honey do you know who yer talkin' to?"Rockett Rimjob:
"To put it simply... faith."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Ah jus' set mahself up fer a joke 'bout mah hands on yew, didn' Ah."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Well Ah wouldn't object."Rockett Rimjob:
"You have faith in God. You have faith that what you are doing is right."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Darn temptress. Ah'm broke is gunna be mah defence!"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"She has faith, as well. Maybe in difference things."Crystal Saint Claire:
"But naw. Believe it 'r not, Ah'm actually a Marshal mahself. Jus' not tha same kind that walks
around with three irons, a badge, an' a..."
Rockett Rimjob:
"And one of those things... seems to be the belief that whatever help you can provide comes
from a poisoned tree, so to speak."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"...well actually Ah'm gonna stop mahself there 'cause Ah got a bad attitude right about now. But
not always."
Rockett Rimjob:
"She quite clearly does not have faith in God. Or me. So how do I approach her then? If she
has no faith in either of us."
Whitney G. Elieen:

"..Huh."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"There can be no healing unless she is willing."Whitney G. Elieen:
"I do not believe... if I could remove the scarification, that she would turn it down quite so
quickly, or vehemently."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"Welp, tha' makes things easier."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Turns out they got a need fer a woman like me."Rockett Rimjob:
"I do not know if she has issues with being healed. But she does have strong feelings about
you healing her."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"...oh my child. Do you not see? If she will not come to me then how can I possibly heal her?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"An' if she's not willin' to take your help, then you cannie help 'er, an' if she won' talk t'you
y'cannie tell her anythin'."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"Tha's the point!"
"Woman that's got a nice pair of hoo-hahs an' a decent shot, willin' ta work both? Reckon Ah'm
not too common a breed."
Rockett Rimjob:
"Strength to change what you can."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Felicity to accept what you cannot."
"Wisdom to know the two apart."
"...Makes sense. Them folks git mighty chatty in bed wit' a pretty thing like yew."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"She will not see. She will not speak. She will do nothing but hate me and I shall bear the
cross time and time again."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Oh you bet."Rockett Rimjob:
"They hated him too you know. They despised him."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Ah got a few stories ta tell."Rockett Rimjob:
"He came to them to offer salivation...and they pinned him to the cross."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Maybe Ah'll gab later. Not too sure how much Ah can say, but..."Rockett Rimjob:
"If my sister would put me to the cross...then so be it."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Right now..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire takes a deep breath.
"Right now, you are incapable of saving her. And it is not only because she will not let you. It
is not only because you are approaching it wrong."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"Technicalleh we're pardners."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"But you will try anyway."Crystal Saint Claire:
"But if she does kill you... then what? What am I supposed to do?"
Crystal Saint Claire suddenly looks a lot more like a scared child.

"...I don't think I could..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"...oh hush child." She says as she grabs her and pulls her close.Whitney G. Elieen:
"...I do not know. I do not know if I could live with that...or forgive her."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Uh-huh. Ah know. Thing is Ah'm sworn ta secrecy 'bout some 'f this shit, an'..."Rockett Rimjob:
"...ain't real simple stuff."
"Have faith. Have faith that I am here for a reason."Whitney G. Elieen:
"...But..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire hugs herself close to Whitney, as the larger woman won't budge...
"But nothing child. God would not have brought me here for nothing."Whitney G. Elieen:
"I must try. She is lost and needs help finding home. She is my family."
"...Sugercube, Ah got some crazy stories of mah own. Undyin' Indians. curses, monsters
straight outta Hell..."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"She is the only family I have left here..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"..."
Whitney G. Elieen leans her head forward and kisses you on the forehead.
"Broad with eyes like yours? Don't doubt it."Rockett Rimjob:
"Calm now...everything will be alright. She will not kill me. She has tried already once before."Whitney G. Elieen:
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"IF she does."
"And yet I am here."Whitney G. Elieen:
Crystal Saint Claire suddenly draws very close to Whitney, whispering something into her ear.
"Mmmmeeeyup. Used ta werk fer th' Agency, if we're on th' secrets tellin' part."Cassie-May O'Brien:
("im gonna need tree fiddy")Rockett Rimjob:
Cassie-May O'Brien kicked a pebble and shoved her hands into her pockets.
Crystal Saint Claire draws back.
"..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Crystal Saint Claire is shaking a little.
"Shhhhh..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen pulls her back
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Shhhhh...calm. Be calm...I am here still..."Whitney G. Elieen:

"And unless I am called to heaven it is here I shall remain."
Whitney G. Elieen slowly lifts herself up
Whitney G. Elieen is still holding crystal in her arms
Crystal Saint Claire buries her face in Whitney's shoulder.
"Walk with me child."Whitney G. Elieen:
"...Huh. Really?"Rockett Rimjob:
Whitney G. Elieen sets her down
Crystal Saint Claire walks, still shaking a little.
"How'd that gig treat ya?"Rockett Rimjob:
"This place reeks of sin."Whitney G. Elieen:
"This is not the place for a sobering discussion."
"...All right..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Eh. Ah quit. Didn' like tha' whole hush-hush policy of them."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Whitney G. Elieen walks out into the town, hand in hand with Crystal.
"...Probably shouldn' git mahself any close ta actual Agents, though. Mighta got a price on
mah head?"
Cassie-May O'Brien:
Crystal Saint Claire walks out, holding tight onto Whitney's hand, a little red around the eyes...
"Miiight be wise."Rockett Rimjob:
Cassie-May O'Brien shrugged with a sheepish grin.
"She likes to think she is the only one who has suffered."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Or you could just hire a bodyguard."Rockett Rimjob:
"I d-don't think... so..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Rockett Rimjob waggles her eyebrows.
"You do not know her the way I do."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Dunnaw, sugercube. Yew know any tha' coulda keep up wit' meh~?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I know... a good bit... about suffering, though."Crystal Saint Claire:
"I had to... study it. For a class."
"She thinks she is the only one who was beaten. She was the only one who has had to walk
in pain...but she is not the only one. For five years I have wandered. Alone. With only the All mighty as my
companion."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"She is not the only one who has suffered though...and neither am I."
"...that hurt mah feelin's."Rockett Rimjob:

Rockett Rimjob pouts.
"You are my friend. You are among the few who are."Whitney G. Elieen:
"I... do not remember them."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Many of them... were what the doctors, my uncle told me..."
"..."
"In the room. I will show you."
"...Your uncle..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Like my father?"
"No."Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire bristles visibly.
Whitney G. Elieen raises her eyebrow
"In the room."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen squeezes
"Realleh? Thought yer gunna mention tha' blonde gal. Mighta know her. Pretty as a picture,
legs up ta sky, went an' stole two army cannons, glued 'em tagether an' insists on callin' tha' a derringer."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
Crystal Saint Claire nods.
"...Ah act'ally had it made by a rich ass gunsmith in Houston."Rockett Rimjob:
"...I wish I could show you Crystal."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen eventually finds a bench where she sits
Whitney G. Elieen pats her lap
"Coulda fooled meh."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Whitney G. Elieen has taken up the entirey of the bench
"Told 'em if he could make me a gun bigger'n 'is dick."Rockett Rimjob:
"Had a sense a' humor, he did."
Crystal Saint Claire sits.
"Huh. Well then. Musta been quite a hoss."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...they look to me and they see a mad woman."Whitney G. Elieen:
Crystal Saint Claire is sitting in Whitney's lap.
"They have not seen it crystal"Whitney G. Elieen:
"They see the power of God and yet they still do not believe. If they knew the home that awaited them..."
"Had ta have a laugh. Barrel's just as long."Rockett Rimjob:

"I have not seen Heaven either. But I have seen things most would call impossible. So I
choose to keep an open mind."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"But when he told me what it shot Ah just about shit mahself."Rockett Rimjob:
"So if anybody ever tells me, 'size don't matter...'"
"I have walked the Garden of Eden. I spoke with God out in her palace. Walking on a bridge
of stars towards an endless sky..."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"All around me...angels. Clouds. Mountains. Waterfalls. Palaces...."
"Well, it wuz too much ta handle fer this lil' gal 'ere."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien winced with a grin, rubbing her mended wrist.
"You should try... to draw it."Crystal Saint Claire:
"...same thing happened ta me."Rockett Rimjob:
"You all right?"
"...to try and draw it would be..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Eeeyup. Righ' as new."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien flexed her wrist.
"Well...like you trying to explain your degree to me."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen says with a chuckle
"But...but I can try."Whitney G. Elieen:
"It can be hard though. The colors of heaven are not the colors of earth."
"And the blueprints I draw are never what I see in my mind."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Good. Woulda felt like shit if ya had ta deal with that fer too long."Rockett Rimjob:
"It is about accepting that things need not be perfect."Crystal Saint Claire:
"..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen sighs
"Aw, shucks. So yew like meh after all!"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I would rather have a good invention finished... Than a perfect one that I never realize."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Because one can change things."
"If yer wrist's broken you'd have ta tickle me with yer lame hand."Rockett Rimjob:
"I feel the wisdom of God speaking through you..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"I am just too weak to comprehend it just yet."
""That's fine! Just comprehend a little of it!"Crystal Saint Claire:
"I try and reach as many as I can...in the only way I know. With a power that is leant to me
from on high."

"And it is a most perfect power. Failed only by this vessel."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Finish comprehending the little bit, and maybe next time you can get a little more!"Crystal Saint Claire:
Rockett Rimjob smirks
Cassie-May O'Brien smacked Rockett's shoulder.
"Ah coulda put mah boot up yer arse!"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Rome was not built in a day."Crystal Saint Claire:
"It'd get stuck."Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob chuckles as she stumbles to the side
"Prob'leh."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Crystal Saint Claire beams at Whitney, her eyes still a little red.
"Then you'd be out a perfectly good boot."Rockett Rimjob:
"Fuck naw, Ah'd jus' wear yew."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...I am blessed to know you"Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen reaches her hand over
Whitney G. Elieen rubs her eyes a bit, as gently as she could.
"Then you'd have tha sexiest boot this side of the Mississippi."Rockett Rimjob:
"An' th' snarkiest. Tha'd make heads turn."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"You are an engineer. I am a servent of the greatest engineer of all."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Together we can solve this problem."
"Makin' heads turn is mah business."Rockett Rimjob:
Poage nods.
Crystal Saint Claire also nods.
"Together, we can do anything, probably."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Help me. Help me reach her. Together we can walk the halls of heaven...and then you will
see "
Whitney G. Elieen:
"God is not the creature so many make her out to be."
"Tha's startin' ta sound like a gewd idea. Ah dunno whut 'bout kickin' doors down."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"She is...gentle. Suprisingly so."Whitney G. Elieen:
"I think... that reaching your sister... Will not be easy, or quick."Crystal Saint Claire:

"Ah'll kick while you swing."Rockett Rimjob:
'Double-kickin' power."
"Or you could jus' use mah forehead as a ram."
"No it will not be."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Sure is thick enough! Them's un' problem wit' tha'."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"It will not require determination, or strength... or... some... third thing..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"But to follow in the example of christ I will keep at it. Even if she would put me up on a
cross."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"It will require care, and tenderness, and, occasionally, it will take doing nothing."Crystal Saint Claire:
"You wouldn't wanna wreck mah pretty face?"Rockett Rimjob:
"She advised the same with you, you know."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Thought more 'bout th' fact Ah don't think Ah coulda lift yew. Yer build like a brick
shithouse."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I asked her about you...in my prayers."Whitney G. Elieen:
"...Your sister advised you about..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"..."
"No. Not her."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen points to the sky
"Point. Means we gotta switch."Rockett Rimjob:
Crystal Saint Claire begins to turn very, very red.
"Bend over."Rockett Rimjob:
"And I asked her about..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen places a finger on your forehead
(brb gotta go back home)Whitney G. Elieen:
"Yew wish."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Crystal Saint Claire is almost the same colour as a new brick wall.
Rockett Rimjob chuckles.

"Ah can go slow an easy, you delicate little flower you."Rockett Rimjob:
"Sounds bettah. Lots a' kissin', lots a' curious fingers roamin..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"That don't sound too bad."Rockett Rimjob:
"Most folks think that them payin' mah salary buys them a one-way ticket ta pound town on tha Rockett Express.
An'... well, it does. But dealin' with stallions like that all day ain't easy."
"Been a few easy-goers, though. Usually tha better ones."
"...Eh. Ah like it slow mahself..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Different strokes fer different folks."Rockett Rimjob:
"Heeeeeell of a lotta different strokes."
Rockett Rimjob idly pulls out her derringer and gives it a once-over.
"Eeeyup."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"It is true my child...and she responded."Whitney G. Elieen:
Poage looks like she's going to start giving off steam at any second.
*Crystal Saint Claire:
"She has told me...to have wisdom. To have patience. To be gentle."Whitney G. Elieen:
"My dearest Crystal...you move me with your affection."
"I say this unto you...very few have ever confessed as such to me."
"...bein' around tha block much as Ah have really shows ya how different folks can be."Rockett Rimjob:
"Ain't been a day on this job that I ain't met a person with a lot more ta show than jus' 'is package. An' almost ev'ry
time they don't even know they showin' it."
"Most men are intimidated by my size. Most women do not pay a glance ether. In fact I was
unsure of myself until I had gotten my answer..."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Crystal. A question."
"Why?"
"...why?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Some folks say it's jus' sex. That's true, sorta. Nothin' wrong with it."Rockett Rimjob:
Cassie-May O'Brien looked up at Rockett.
"I am not remarkable. My power is borrowed."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Most consider me insane...or unapproachable."
"But it don't matter how much ya try ta make it 'jus' sex' -- it ain't gonna change how ya grab on
to 'em, how ya feel 'em up, how ya look at 'em, how ya breathe, how ya move, how ya speak to 'em..."

"Ah think it's sorta like bein' a nurse. Only you ain't mendin' wounds -- yer helpin' some poor sod detox. Destress.
Stop feelin' lonely fer a spell."
"...for many reasons. I find you beautiful. I enjoy your company. You talk with me, and try to
understand rather than write me off as some child genius sideshow. But... I think the most important thing is...
what you said. What you say."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"Folks can call me a slut all they like. Ah think it's a noble profession."Rockett Rimjob:
"...pay ain't too bad at all, neither."
Rockett Rimjob digs into her bag and pulls out a light cigar.
"It would be easy to love you because you are strong, or because you have... the abilities
you do."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"Yer sellin' companionship an' closeness. Ain' somethin' found oftenCassie-May O'Brien:
'ere in th' West. Nawt ta feel lonely, if jus' fer a moment."
"...Sex ain' too bad at all, neither?"
Cassie-May O'Brien smiled at Rockett.
"...but you don't act like that. Like... like everyone is supposed to love you, because you are
who you are."
Crystal Saint Claire:
Rockett Rimjob scoffs a bit. "Depends on tha customer."
"Depends on what they want. How much they wanna be in control."Rockett Rimjob:
"It is difficult to explain..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"An' how much they know 'bout what they're doin'."Rockett Rimjob:
"You are not, alone, remarkable."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Ya'd think detectives 're rarer'n albino bison with how few of those poor bastards can't find yer
clit."
Rockett Rimjob:
"Nobody really is, are they?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Anyone who is remarkable has had help. And time."
"My sister...is remarkable. Nephi is remarkable. You Crystal...you are remarkable."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Bahah! Well, us gals are a lil' more complicated than 'em. Ain' much ta do 'round a pecker,
kinda stands out."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I do not know... about Nephi. But I had help."Crystal Saint Claire:
"And so do I."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Correct."Crystal Saint Claire:
"The very best help of all. Without her...I am nothing."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Alone, without anyone's influence... You would be average, and I would be dead."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Sometimes ya run across someone that either wants you ta take charge, or knows what tha hell
they're doin'. Not as common, but those're pretty fun."

"But you understand that. You don't act like... like the remarkability is yours and yours
alone."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"...I love you because... b-because..."
"..."
"I cannot explain."
Cassie-May O'Brien put her hands in her pockets again and kicked another pebble.
"...Ah wouldn' know."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...like trying to explain heaven."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen chuckles
"There are things that cannot be explained."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Love. Music. Humor. Religion."
"You end up sounding like a fool."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Speaking of greater things."
"You cannot explain them without using them as reference, or else they fall apart."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Take it you've never tango'd before?"Rockett Rimjob:
"But the point is not to explain them."Crystal Saint Claire:
"The point is the trying."
"Professor Cecil always said that if you give someone an answer, then they have an answer."
"Hah! Naw, Ah ain' tha innocent. Jus' didn' have many. Them's been Joey... Hah! We both
had naw idea whut we wuz doin'. Paw caught us in th' barn."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"But if you give them a question, they will find their own answers, and those will be so much
more precious to them."
Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire is speaking unusally clearly, no trace of her usual muttering and mumbling.
"My sabbath school teacher used to say that!"Whitney G. Elieen:
"So... the reason I love you... is because I love you. Right now, that is all I can say."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Chased th' poor boy wit' a pitchfork while he tried ta put his pants on... Ah jus' yelled at 'im
ta stop an' started throwin' potatoes at mah Paw there."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"And I say this to you Crystal...your reason is reason enough to me."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Beyond the love of God...it has been a long time since anyone has said that to me."
"Not since...mother actually. My sister loved me once. Father did as well. In his own flawed way."
Rockett Rimjob chuckles at that, shaking her head as she lights up her cigar. "Sounds about right. It's
funny. Lotsa paws out there do it 'cause their angry, but some of 'em don't even do it 'cause they're
worried or upset. Lot of 'em know their daughter's grown, an' that this is inevitable. They jus' wanna have
a story ta tell an' somethin' ta laugh at later. Like it's a tradition."
"...it ain't a safe gamble ta call any bluffs, though. Ah know Ah'd be runnin' if Ah was some poor
jackass with his pants around his ankles an' a pitchfork at his back."

Whitney G. Elieen removes the cross that hangs around it

Whitney G. Elieen takes your hand in her own and places it within your tiny palm

Cassie-May O'Brien looked at Rockett.
"Know that no matter what happens to me...or wherever God needs me to go, know that I am

Whitney G. Elieen:
"Besides, imagine younger meh wearin' only a hat throwin' potatoes at yew an' yellin'

Rockett Rimjob looks Cassie up and down.

Rockett Rimjob struggles to keep a straight face.
"Ah got lotta freckles, sugercube."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"In places."
"...Then... I should promise the same!"Crystal Saint Claire:
Whitney G. Elieen chuckles
"It would not... be fair."Crystal Saint Claire:
"To abandon everything onto you."
"Oh my child..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"We will share the burdens."Crystal Saint Claire:
Cassie-May O'Brien smiled. That didn't last long, replaced by a wistful look on her face.

"...Then them bad times came an' Ah didn' got time ta think 'bout hanky-panky. Then...
Them wuz a few drunken adventures on th' road, but... Ah don't even remember their faces, let alone names."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"You had best be careful as well."Whitney G. Elieen:
"In fact I am counting on it."
"I will be careful... but I will not abandon you!"Crystal Saint Claire:
Whitney G. Elieen speaks with a gentle voice. Gentle...yet firm.
"...I will do everything I can to help."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Bad times blown over by now, Ah hope," she notes, puffing on her cigar. "Ya look like a woman
who's got 'er act tagether. Not tha kind da bang an' blast."
Rockett Rimjob:
"You must promise me. Let this cross mark that promise."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Hmmmm..."
"Crystal, do you have something sharp?"
"...several things. Why."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Eeeyup. Ain' gotten any in... Fffuh, over a year now, Ah think. Didn' really wanna jus' fling

Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Give your thumb a prick for me please"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Good on ya, then."Rockett Rimjob:

Whitney G. Elieen flinches just a little
You however...feel nothingWhitney G. Elieen:
Just a pressure...but nothing.

No pain. You don't even feel blood."Whitney G. Elieen:

"You just got over a bout of illness. Your immune system is tired."Crystal Saint Claire:
"And so...you will be careful yes?"Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen picks herself up and you along with her
"Also I do not know if that needle has poked any of my samples."Crystal Saint Claire:
Whitney G. Elieen sets you carefully down.
"Keep up?"Rockett Rimjob:
"So if you would not mind going to the bar, so I could get some alcohol to clean the
puncture..."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"You would not have poked yourself with a dirty needle."Whitney G. Elieen:
"But very well."
"Summun' tha' coulda watch my back, nawt summun' ta save every five minutes."Cassie-May O'Brien:

Whitney G. Elieen looks at you, her face suddenly very stern.
Crystal Saint Claire freezes like a deer in the headlights.
"That'd be ahdeal, yeah."Rockett Rimjob:

"You woulda liked Jones, Ah think."
Rockett Rimjob puffs idly, staring at the glowing tip of her cigar.

Rockett Rimjob holds the cigar out to Cassie.

Cassie-May O'Brien took the cigar and puffed it a few times before returning.
"We're gunna figger out who an' why bought him a farm an' put 'em to justice."Cassie-May O'Brien:

Rockett Rimjob holds the cigar out to Cass.
"Do you think God would forgive me if I treat myself out?~"Whitney G. Elieen:
"I think as long as your remain within the rules you have remained within, things will be

Crystal Saint Claire:
"...I could get you a hat."
Cassie-May O'Brien takes it and takes a few puffs.

Rockett Rimjob grasps at her forehead, lifting her hair.

"Usually depends on how much money an' drugs they got."
"When I was younger I always wanted a pretty dress...not that I am saying you should!"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Nothing ever fit me, so mother had to make one for me."

"I lack the fabric."
"A dress is different then a vest of armor...though i appreciate it all the same."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Might be good."Rockett Rimjob:
"Ah'm gonna hang out here for a while, finish this cigar."
"Perhaps one of these days i shall get you fabric?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"And... the shapes I would have to cut the fabric into in order to create a dress, rather than
an abomination."

Whitney G. Elieen looks over to the approaching Nephi

"Or something happened."
"Do you know where he would be in dodge?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Probably wherever you find the boys in blue crashing for the night."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...Just feels weird. First time in a long time he hasn't written me back."
"Well... maybe we can send the Union Railroad office a letter asking about the well-being of
your brother?"
Crystal Saint Claire:
"I get a... Lotta mail."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"We should go. To check up on him."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Tell them you are concerned, as he usually writes you back..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"I will. Still, got mail from some of the others though."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Though he shall be in my prayers, I feel you need more than just a comforting message to

"Did you grow into the hat as well?"Crystal Saint Claire:
GodWhitney G. Elieen:
The picture is clearly several years old. Four boys, four girls.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...is that the same hat you're wearing now?"Crystal Saint Claire:
Whitney G. Elieen picks Crystal up from her shoulders and places her down on the ground
Crystal Saint Claire stands there.
"Nephi if you do not mind watching Crystal for a moment?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Is something wrong?"
Two parents, it seems. One of them is wearing a mystery substance-stained once-
white lab coat, and the other looks every bit... Like Cassie, almost. but quite a bit older. Trail-worn and hard, but
better rested.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"No. Everything is fine." She says with the biggest, most awkward grin on her otherwise pretty
face.
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Yeah sure.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"And yeah, it is."
"You only say it like that when things are not fine"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Alma's hat. He's the oldest."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I am worried now."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Pa gave it to him, he gave it to me when he went to work with the railroad."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I just...need a walk is all. A little time alone to pray."Whitney G. Elieen:
"I promise I will be back right quick"
"Okay!"Crystal Saint Claire:
"And we can go to the store together."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Alma's that one. The guy the size of Whitney."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Whitney G. Elieen gives Crystal a hug
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has completely lost track of the other two and is just reminiscing.
Crystal Saint Claire returns the hug without her usual hesitation.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is using that same voice that parents use when talking about their kids.
"I will be back in a moment...do keep an eye on her."Whitney G. Elieen:
"So... you said I reminded you of one of our sisters..."Crystal Saint Claire:

Whitney, in her endless benevolence, decides to pay a visit to the clinic where Doc
Mitchell worked. With the lack of the proprietor, there must be a need for someone with healing expertise, and
Whitney does serve the Great Physician.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
The door opens with a creak and she can see a few individuals laid out on beds. There is no nurse present, but
the injured appear to have been given basic care.
They all need more than that.
Whitney G. Elieen makes her way inside, step after thunderous step. Frowning in pure and utter concern
for those in need.
"Hello all of you...who is the caretaker? I had heard the doctor had taken off."Whitney G. Elieen:
Several of them stop moving when they hear Whitney's voice. She can see one with
no leg and bandages covering his head. There is another next to him with a heavily wrapped torso. Both push
themselves away from Whitney as they realize who she is, muttering fearfully as they do.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
(pause, I need to go do something)
(sorry)
(It is quite alright)Whitney G. Elieen:
"You do not need to be frightened..." She speaks, in her ever soft and soothing voice. "I have come to provide
whatever comfort and aid I can give that is within my power to give you."

Whitney G. Elieen slowly removes her hand from the once maimed leg. Her body shivering and
shuddering in pain as it takes on form and life again.
There is pain Whitney, and there is hell. Hell is your left leg. The pain does not
subside as normal. It continues. The bandages on the man's leg move slow, almost imperceptible. There is
healing, but it is slow.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Whitney G. Elieen reaches her hand forward to the injury on his head. Her hands trembling. A terrible fury
burning within her left leg. Fighting back every urge to cry out in pain.

Crystal Saint Claire is holding back tears.
It takes a half hour for the party to get to the General store with the pace they must
hold.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
The owner, Mister Bean, is sitting in his chair when Crystal first sees him.
Crystal Saint Claire sprints towards him.
He has the door open for them when he sees the man struggling along with Whitney.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"What's going on?"General Store Owner:
Crystal Saint Claire almost immediately starts blurting out an almost indecipherable description of the
events.
"Whitney'nIwentovertodoctortohelpwithpatientsandshetriedtohealoneandithurtherbutshetriedagainandthenshejustf

Crystal Saint Claire:
General Store Owner keeps his eyes locked on Crystal as she explains matters. His eyes do not widen
and his brows do not raise. He does look up near the tail end of the explanation to look at Whitney and the
man with the peculiar pristine foot.
"Wait."General Store Owner:
"Be back."
Crystal Saint Claire just nods.
General Store Owner creaks off on the floorboards of the general store towards the back end and grabs
an unlabeled jar from a shelf whose contents do not appear to be for sale.
Crystal Saint Claire then slowly sits on the ground... tucks her knees to her chest... and starts crying like
the little girl she is.
General Store Owner catches sight of Crystal on his way back and makes a slight detour. Bean is back
moments later.
"Here."General Store Owner:
General Store Owner he presses a long stick wrapped in crinkling paper into Crystal's hands.
"Make you feel better."General Store Owner:
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
General Store Owner walks over to Whitney.
Crystal Saint Claire reflexively receives it.
Healed Bandit stands as still as he can in the presence of Mr. Bean.
General Store Owner unscrews the lid on the jar. There is a slight pop, and the smell becomes evident to
the entire room.

"What was the matter with him?"
"Who?"Healed Bandit:
"The other."Whitney G. Elieen:
"There were bandages over his chest..."
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire holds onto Whitney REALLY TIGHT
"Abd-dominal wound."Crystal Saint Claire:
"P-please... don't... right now..."
Whitney G. Elieen closes her eyes

Whitney G. Elieen takes a deep breath
"...my work is not done."Whitney G. Elieen:
"I c-can..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Healed Bandit pushes himself up to a sitting position.
"I c-can help him... t-to give you time... to get b-better..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"He'll be fine."Healed Bandit:
"Said so."
"He weren't lying."
"Nurse'll take care of him."
"...are you certain?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"I can heal him..."
"No need."Healed Bandit:
Whitney G. Elieen takes another step forward, almost stumbling again as she does
"...I told you I would not preach to you. But remember what had happened...and put this to
good use."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"I will pray for you both..."
Whitney G. Elieen looks down at Crystal.
Crystal Saint Claire has her face buried in Whitney's dress, and is still trembling...
"Thank you for bringing me here." She looks over to the store owner. "And thank you for
reviving me..."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"please..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"d-don't go..."
"Child...I am not going anywhere."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Don't mention it."Healed Bandit:
General Store Owner leans against one of the shelves of the store.
Whitney G. Elieen squeezes you with a noticeably weaker grip
"Welcome."General Store Owner:
"Both of you. All three of you. God bless..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"You... sh-should rest."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Shall we go back to the inn then?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"I feel the need to...sit..."
Whitney G. Elieen said with clear pain in her voice
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire nods.
"Do you have... crutches?"Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire looks to Bean.
"There is no need..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"If you fall, I will not be able to pick you up."Crystal Saint Claire:
"I dare not take a crutch away from one who could truly use it..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"We can borrow them."Crystal Saint Claire:
Whitney G. Elieen said as she limps her way to the door
"I...don't think I need this one."Healed Bandit:
"..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Healed Bandit slides the crutch he used on the way over to Whitney. He gets up from the floor, a little
shaky, but his new leg serves him well.
Whitney G. Elieen slowly lowers herself down and grabs the crutch
"God bless you sir..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"..."Healed Bandit:
"Seems to have done that already."
"What is your name sir?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"If you do not mind me asking..."
"Jon."Healed Bandit:
"You will be in my prayers Jon."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Thanks."Healed Bandit:
"Keep the others in there too."
"I promise..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Now come along Crystal."
"Rest with me."
Whitney G. Elieen hobbles her way over to the door, as slowly as she can.
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire accompanies her, not letting go for a moment.
Healed Bandit stays standing for a moment, lost in thought. He heads out of the door in the direction
opposite Crystal and Whitney two minutes later.
I think from here...we can take this to discord. Would this count as a conversion Doc? There
are special mechanics for that.
Whitney G. Elieen:

and hate myself for a few minues
"...So."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Wut?"Rockett Rimjob:
Meanwhile, I'm playing Total Warhammer and realizing I do not have enough
assassins to deal with all these chaos sorcerers.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Anyun act'alleh got an idea where ta start lookin'?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...The clinic?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Ah was gonna say."Rockett Rimjob:
"Where tha hell else would ya start lookin' fer a doc?"
"Morgue?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"So tha clinic."Rockett Rimjob:
"..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Worst case scenario."Alexander Hauswald:
"How long ago was this?"
Alexander Hauswald points at Sacks.
"Sacks could probably sniff him out."Alexander Hauswald:
"...Ah guess. Sawrry, sugercubes, them nightmares were... _bad_ tonight. Ah'm still kinda
outta it."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Couple months ago."Rockett Rimjob:
Alexander Hauswald looks at Cassie. Worried?
Rockett Rimjob pats Cass on the back.
"...He might be able to."Alexander Hauswald:
"He a good sniffer?"Rockett Rimjob:
"He might be part hound."Alexander Hauswald:
Sacks looks at Alexander, unamused.
"Then again, not sure he's entirely dog, either."Alexander Hauswald:
Cassie-May O'Brien pulls her hat off for a moment to smack herself a few times.
"...Ah need anuth'r coffee."Cassie-May O'Brien:

Rockett Rimjob scratches behind Sacks' ears.
Sacks wags his tail at the pretty lady giving him scritchies.
"...I think I can help with that."Alexander Hauswald:
"Ah'll be sure ta grab some extra grounds case you run out, with that habit of yers."Rockett Rimjob:
"Ah got like twelve pounds of coffee in mah backpack."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"..."Alexander Hauswald:
"I need water and I'll fix you something."
"So what, that'll last you about three days?"Rockett Rimjob:
(Where are we, right now? Dodge, or..?)Crystal Saint Claire:
((the limbo of "no idea until Doc appears", Poage))Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...Mahbe four."
Rockett Rimjob chuckles a bit, shaking her head.
((Heard! Thanks.))Crystal Saint Claire:
"I could try to make you some sort of... on-the-go brewer..."
"...Why?"Alexander Hauswald:
"You need fire, a pot, and water."
"That's all."
"It's like pulp in orange juice. Some people dislike feeling the grounds between their teeth."Crystal Saint Claire:
"This is Cassie."Alexander Hauswald:
"So? She deserves nice things..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Ah bought a gold sieve real cheap ta try ta git them grounds out..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"A sieve?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"May I take a look?"
"Again."Alexander Hauswald:
Rockett Rimjob 's ears perk up.
"I can help."Alexander Hauswald:
"Sieve!"Rockett Rimjob:
"That reminds me!"
Cassie-May O'Brien rummaged through her backpack and pulled out a large prospector's sieve used for
washing gold.
"Ah gotta run up ta Fargo 'fore tha winter rolls in..."Rockett Rimjob:
"Do you need the whole thing? Or could you part with a piece of the screen?"Crystal Saint Claire:

"Ah jus' wanna sumthin' Ah coulda brew mah coffee wit'."Cassie-May O'Brien:
'Tha's too large."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano walks up.
"...What're you folk on about?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Cass."Rockett Rimjob:
"You ever heard'a hockey?"
"A whuh?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...What's hockey?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Tha most goddamn fun you'll ever have on ice."Rockett Rimjob:
"There's no ice here."Alexander Hauswald:
"Fuck, y'all ain't never been north, have ya?"Rockett Rimjob:
"I have."Crystal Saint Claire:
"No plans for it."Alexander Hauswald:
"Define north."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I have a degree from MIT, is that far enough north?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Anywhere Fargo an' upwards, about."Rockett Rimjob:
"Philidelphia is north..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Philly? Naw, they wouldn't have hockey there."Rockett Rimjob:
"Isn't that part of indian territory, now?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Naw, that's Bismarck."Rockett Rimjob:
"All I know about philladelphia is that Thomas ain't there and that they think cheese in
steaks is a good idea."
Alexander Hauswald:
"...that's all ya really need ta know about Philly ta know you don't wanna stay there too often."Rockett Rimjob:
"That is... innaccurate"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Even if tha money there's good Ah don't much like that place."Rockett Rimjob:
"...I dislike it as well."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Whyzzat?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Anyway Cass. You ever heard of pigskin?"Rockett Rimjob:
"For different reasons."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Y'all mean tha' ball thing?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Yeah. Tha sport."Rockett Rimjob:

"Played 'round once ot twice."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Sacks barks loudly at the mention of pigs and balls!
"Good. Y'ever heard'a golf?"Rockett Rimjob:
"I did."Alexander Hauswald:
"An' have ya ever heard'a boxing?"Rockett Rimjob:
"Eeeyup."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Put those three tagether. Two teams, five players each."Rockett Rimjob:
"Then slap ice skates on 'em an' put 'em in an ice rink."
"Sounds like a mess."Alexander Hauswald:
"So... Yew got people tryin' ta score a goal wit' a pigskin smacked 'round wit' sticks while
boxin' each other?"
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"On ice?"
"Yes."Rockett Rimjob:
"It's a royal mess but it's so damn fun."
"Tha' sounds like sumthin' y'all think up when real bored an' real drunk."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...well, it ain't a pigskin. It's closer to a rock."Rockett Rimjob:
"An', well... that probly ain't far from tha truth, knowin' tha folks that live up there."
"Ain't much ta do there 'cept drink, fuck, an' freeze ta death."
"Yer puntin' a rock."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"..."
"With sticks."Rockett Rimjob:
"Tha' game sounds designed ta see how many amusin' injuries yew can git in a period o'
time."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Ah wanna see it."
"There's a reason hockey players ain't got much teeth left."Rockett Rimjob:
"I believe we should focus on locating the doctor for now..."Crystal Saint Claire:
(I'm kind of running on the assumption we're in transit to Dodge.)Rockett Rimjob:
(same)Cassie-May O'Brien:
(same)Crystal Saint Claire:
"Kinda hard ta do that when we ain't even in Dodge yet."Rockett Rimjob:
"If you start planning once you get there, it is time wasted. Why not hammer out some sort
of skeleton of a plan?"
Crystal Saint Claire:
"Step one, step two, et cetera."

"Step one. Go to tha clinic. If he ain't there, go to tha bar."Rockett Rimjob:
"Boom."
"Why the bar?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Also, Sacks could try sniffing him."Alexander Hauswald:
"It's Doc Mitchell. Bastard whets his whistle jus' as much as he wets wounds."Rockett Rimjob:
"I... um..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"This is just... a theory..."
"But if I was on the run from someone I thought might want me dead, and was trying to lay low..."
"I would not demonstrate any distinctive abilities."
"For example, if I were you, trying to blend in somewhere, I would either refrain from sex, or hide out in a brothel.
Hide a leaf in the woods, so to speak."
"Unless there are a lot of doctors in Dodge, word of a new doctor would spread quickly, reaching the ears of
people one would be trying to avoid... at least, I think..."
Crystal Saint Claire never looks up from her book.
"He don't seem like tha kinda guy ta squat, but you might got a point."Rockett Rimjob:
"If he don't wanna be found, though, Ah ain't sure we could find 'em though."
"Ah guess we're gunna werry 'bout him in hidin' if we don't find him."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Why would he?"Alexander Hauswald:
"The desperado was hunting lawmen, not doctors."
"...Yew got a point there."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"He might not know that."Rockett Rimjob:
"Because the exact thing that's currently happening might happen, no?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Some new Marshals might decide to look into surviving witnesses. And they might find out something."
"Like what?"Alexander Hauswald:
"His drinking problem?"
"His cult membership?"
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"I thought higher of you than this, Hauswald."
"You were an agent, no?"
"I don't think our lawman-killer thinks that far ahead."Alexander Hauswald:
"Pinkerton, yes."
"Well if he's keen on hidin', Ah'll do some diggin'. Maybe lure 'em out."Rockett Rimjob:
"So, if you do something you don't want anyone to see, and someone sees it"Crystal Saint Claire:
"What is the desired outcome?"

"You don't go killing someone in broad daylight as he goes to the doctor if you want
nobody to see it."
Alexander Hauswald:
"He was either very stupid or wanted people to know."
"He's done this before. Had a few other marshals go out like Jones did."Rockett Rimjob:
"Whoever's doin' this has done it before."
"Somewhere where someone could see them?"Alexander Hauswald:
"So why has there been no progress on the case?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Because all the marshals are dead."Alexander Hauswald:
"Sans us."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Here's hoping we're better than him."Alexander Hauswald:
"Fossifer's not dead?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"He's the manager."Alexander Hauswald:
"Could have posted a bounty for witnesses."Crystal Saint Claire:
"He doesn't go around solving crimes."Alexander Hauswald:
"He appears to be hands-on enough to get us to him. Why not pick up some information for
us while he waited?"
Crystal Saint Claire:
"...Y'know, it act'alleh _is_ kinda weird no one went ta talk wit' Doc Mitchell there 'bout this
before."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
Alexander Hauswald shrugs.
"Anyone wants to bet Fossifer's our desperado?"Alexander Hauswald:
"...Why'd he be?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I don't know. It's like one of those penny dreadfuls teists."Alexander Hauswald:
"Two hundred dollars says he's not."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Ah don't think any of us have that much."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"One of us does~!"Crystal Saint Claire:
"...Huh."Alexander Hauswald:

Rockett Rimjob stays oddly quiet during this conversation.
Crystal Saint Claire mumbles something
"..."Alexander Hauswald:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has also been standing on the opposite side of the group to Rockett, putting as
many people as possible between the two in case she got any crazy ideas, like, kissin him or something.
Alexander Hauswald looks at Rockett.
"You too."Alexander Hauswald:

Alexander Hauswald ponders if it's worth pulling his gun out.
Whitney G. Elieen starts to hum along with Nephi to the tune

S'fine, we haven't started fullon yetCrystal Saint Claire:
It is a short journey over to Dodge from Kansas, though it is still a few hundred miles.
The train arrives in the station close to five o clock. The sun is beginning the descent into dusk and light is growing
short. The way to the local clinic is still apparent, even in the dimness. The party follows a dirt road to a shack that
appears to have been recently re-purposed. It seems like just the spot for a fugitive Doc.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano follows with his Lightning Repeater in hand.

Cassie-May O'Brien pulls the shotgun off her shoulder and prepares it.

"Are we within town limits?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Cass."Alexander Hauswald:
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers follows with her hand on her gun
"I'm afraid that backing down just ain't in my nature."Doc Mitchell:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano loads bullets into his rifle's cylinder.

Cassie-May O'Brien actually tries to sneak
Those peeking in the door can see a couple rag tag blokes. All with pistols, except the
big fella, he's got an axe.

"...Take your places, everyone."Alexander Hauswald:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano goes on a leisurely stroll around the house.
"I watched my wife and child get taken by those bastards."Beaumont Clark:
"Barely got my goddamn freedom."
"I think I can make a good argument here... if you'll permit me?"Crystal Saint Claire:
Alexander Hauswald stops his breath, focusing on casting a spell or two.
Cassie-May O'Brien points at Callie and at the western window

Cassie-May O'Brien blinks and gently but firmly pushes Crystal backwards.
Crystal Saint Claire falls on her butt.

Crystal Saint Claire has... REALLY POOR balance.

Crystal Saint Claire puts her gun back in the bag.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano resists the urge to wave
"Could y'all do me a favor an' slip them things back in their holsters? An' Ah don't mean that tent

Rockett Rimjob:
"Let's be reasonable about this."

Beaumont Clark holsters his pistol, reluctantly.
Denard tucks his gun into his overall pocket.
Rockett Rimjob saunters on over to Mitchell, slowly, careful not to seem too urgent or threatening.
Marbh Teine holsters.
Doc Mitchell raises an eyebrow to Rockett as she walks over.
"Now. Ah can't fault Doc fer doin' his job. He's a respectable man with a solid set'a morals he
practices jus' as much as 'e practices 'is faith."
Rockett Rimjob:
"Same time, though, Ah can't fault folks fer havin' a couple scores ta settle."
"Doc, where'd them Fedders run off to after you took care of 'em?"
"Rest of them are still up at the jail."Doc Mitchell:

"They got some guns, too," she says as an afterthought. "But they ain't wanna risk none'a that, do ya?" she asks
them.
"I suppose not."Beaumont Clark:
Crystal Saint Claire is hugging Whitney's good leg.
"Lettin' a lady walk all over ya aye?"Marbh Teine:
"Soft hearted awld blackie y'are."
Whitney G. Elieen places a hand on her head and ruffles
Whitney G. Elieen smiles softly
Cassie-May O'Brien tensed up
Beaumont Clark turns to Teine with no expression on his face.
"...maybe Ah was wrong."Rockett Rimjob:
Beaumont Clark lays a hand on the smaller man's shoulder.
Beaumont Clark pats him twice and grins.
"No softer than an paddie without potatoes."Beaumont Clark:
Marbh Teine throws his red head back in a belly laugh.
"...damn, that's cold."Rockett Rimjob:
"Ye fucker you."Marbh Teine:
Cassie-May O'Brien relaxed a bit
"If y'ask me, y'all look like you could handle some Fedders, way you spooked Mitchell. Might
need a visit ta Mitchell afterwards, though, which Ah'm sure he'll be more'n happy ta oblige."
Rockett Rimjob:
"Wouldn't 'e?"
Rockett Rimjob looks at Doc.
"Never turned down a patient."Doc Mitchell:
I can't even right nowWhitney G. Elieen:
"There ya have it, folks. Reckon you wouldn't lose an arm an' a leg, in either tha literal sense or
tha coinpurse sense. Ah'm sure Ah could help y'all out if it meant clearin' out some rowdy Fedders."
Rockett Rimjob:
Crystal Saint Claire hugs Whitknee
"Maybe he can help your leg."Crystal Saint Claire:
"...with costs. Not tha gunfight. Ah'm sure y'all wouldn't need a lady helpin' you out there
anyhow."
Rockett Rimjob:
Sackhead hacks up something that stains the other side of the facemask.
Doc Mitchell walks over to the other side of the slab and picks up a stethoscope.

Rockett Rimjob turns back to the five men on the other side of the room.
"We can use all the help we can get."Beaumont Clark:
How HUGE is Beaumont?(From Crystal Saint Claire):
not near as big as Whitney.(To Poage):
Garret is actually bigger than Beaumont.(To Poage):
"Ah'm sure there're some rowdy folks in Dodge proper willin' ta help you out. Ask 'round tha bar."Rockett Rimjob:
Anywhere near Inyanga size, any of 'em?(From Crystal Saint Claire):
Nope, he's a bit bigger than...anything Crystal has seen.(To Poage):
Oh shit even Whitney(From Crystal Saint Claire):
"Reckon there might be."Beaumont Clark:
"Might also be sympathizers."
"Only one way to find out 'Monty."Herrelson:
"Ain't too hard ta weed out Fedders."Rockett Rimjob:
"Not too hard to find them."Herrelson:
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers grumbles softly to herself
"Hard to weed out."Herrelson:
"Keep growing up in unlikely places."
"Like eight day rash."
Can Uncle Ichabod be the TF2 Demoman?(From Crystal Saint Claire):
"Point is. Y'all's beef lies with Fedders, not some poor ethical bastard tryin' ta make ends meet.
He's offerin' ya help, one way 'r the other."
Rockett Rimjob:
"Y'get me?"
"I get you."Beaumont Clark:
Gnawly Garret taps his hand against his dusty trousers.
"Monty, I gots to get back to the chopping, eh?"Gnawly Garret:
Beaumont Clark shrugs his shoulders and cracks his neck.
"Alright, sorry to have taken up your time."Beaumont Clark:
"Thanks, fellas. 'Preciate reasonable folk like y'all."Rockett Rimjob:
Beaumont Clark tips his hat to Rockett and Doc Mitchell.
"Be seein' you."Beaumont Clark:

Cassie-May O'Brien relaxes, loweing her shotgun and jus chilling against the frame.
"That'll cost ya a little extra. Ah'll be at tha bar t'night, fellas~"Rockett Rimjob:
"Keep it in your pants Garret."Marbh Teine:
UrbanCritter sighs, lowering his gun and sliding it back in the holster.
The men file out. None seem surprised by the rest of the party standing on the other
side of the door.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Cassie-May O'Brien tips her stetson to them as they pass by.
Rockett Rimjob turns to Doc, and her happy expression wilts as soon as all the fellas are out the door.
"Fellas."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Scuse me."Gnawly Garret:
"You. Owe me," she says quietly.Rockett Rimjob:
Crystal Saint Claire looks downward as the men pass
Whitney G. Elieen backs herself up ever so slightly
"Kindly thanks, eh."Gnawly Garret:
Crystal Saint Claire steps out of the way, trying to pull her bag.
"God bless."Whitney G. Elieen:

"I think I like her."Alexander Hauswald:
"C'mon in, Hauswald. Cassie."Rockett Rimjob:
"Rest of ya."
Cassie-May O'Brien puts her shotgun on her shoulder and slinks inside.
Rockett Rimjob looks a little tired of Doc's shit.
Alexander Hauswald walks in, followed by doggo.
Doc Mitchell purses his lips and nods.

Whitney G. Elieen hobbles forward
Cassie-May O'Brien did not holster her shotgun in the sling on her back yet.
"Right, they all gone?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Doc Mitchell slices open the shirt of the man on the slab. There's a rather large set of lacerations running
across the abdomen, and what looks like a pair of boobs.
"...What hurt her?"Alexander Hauswald:
"..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Fix up that poor sod. You can talk an' work, right, Mitchell?" she asks, glancing down at her.Rockett Rimjob:
"Knew that, probably wouldn't be so spry."Doc Mitchell:

"What are the extent of the injuries?"Whitney G. Elieen:

Doc Mitchell eyes Whitney for a long moment.
"Do. Not."Crystal Saint Claire:
Whitney G. Elieen puts a hand up to shush Crystal
"I don't think so Miss."Doc Mitchell:
"You've got the look about you."
"Who is this one that lays here?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"...You can trust her."Alexander Hauswald:
"She does a good job."

Doc Mitchell takes a journal off his surgical table and tears a page out. He takes an ink pen out of his
jacket pocket.
Whitney G. Elieen opens her eyes and looks over...
Whitney G. Elieen slowly pushes herself off the wall
Doc Mitchell puts the page down on a clear spot of the slab and starts sketching.
"His hat was...what you'd expect a cheap desperado to wear."Doc Mitchell:
"Same as the clothes."
"Cheap, tattered."
"What you expect."
"Anything distinguishing? A gun? Buckle?"Alexander Hauswald:
"But...the face."Doc Mitchell:
Crystal Saint Claire is sitting on the floor now.
Crystal Saint Claire has he knees to her chest.
Doc Mitchell scribbles jagged, angry lines over where the head should be underneath the hat.
"..."Rockett Rimjob:
"...Was it scarred to all hell? Or some sorta..."
Cassie-May O'Brien scratched her head.
Rockett Rimjob trails off, not sure what to call it.
Cassie-May O'Brien looked over at Alexander.
"...Tha's sumthin' huckstin'-like. Or manitous."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"You know how..."Doc Mitchell:
Alexander Hauswald , a veteran of the weird west and an expert in the occult, examines the drawing very
closely.
"A face."Doc Mitchell:
"Can get shaded by the brim of a wide hat?"
"It was like that."
"...might I take a look?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"...Righ."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"And it was like that even if he was staring into the sun."Doc Mitchell:
"His whole face was shade."Alexander Hauswald:
"Got it.
"...Hm."Rockett Rimjob:

Whitney G. Elieen hobbles just a bit closer
((Anything I need to roll, Doc? Knowledge (Occult) or something?))Alexander Hauswald:
"Doc, Ah need yew ta close yer eyes an' think real hard on his other things. Y'all said he

Cassie-May O'Brien closes her eyes and shudders, remembering the weird nightmare.
Crystal Saint Claire takes the little black box out of her bag.

((God dammit why is there so little Deadlands shit online))Alexander Hauswald:

Alexander Hauswald:

Doc Mitchell picks the pen up off the paper and points it at his right eye.
"Someone explain"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Load fulla hogwash, it sounds like."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"It's just a fella with a weird hat."
"...Alright. I... I think I know a thing or two about revenants."Alexander Hauswald:
"All this gasping and ''oh no" is all very dramatic, but useless for conveying information."Crystal Saint Claire:
"It goes in towns, finds the most senior lawman, and shoots 'em dead."Alexander Hauswald:
"...What's the date?"
"Anywhere else, Doc? Jus' th' eye?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Only took one shot."Doc Mitchell:

"Jones was still babbling, but he was dead soon as the bullet went through him."Doc Mitchell:
"Trust me, I've seen a fair few head wounds in my time."
"What's the date today?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Anyone?"
Rockett Rimjob grits her teeth.
"Just checking to see if anyone can hear me."Crystal Saint Claire:
"What is the date..?"
"This... This is all myth I'm hearing, but next time we hear from him should be the
thirteenth of the month at High Noon."

"Eeenope. But Ah sure as sugar know it's real real hard ta kill."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Awkay - th' good news is, them folks are all safe. Tha' thing only targets them of th' law."
"Do you think... this would do it?"Crystal Saint Claire:
is this thing similar to "The judge" that Whitney witnessed so long ago?(From Whitney G. Elieen):
Crystal Saint Claire holds out a the little black box containing the Ghost Shell she purchased.
"...Bad news are we're the law."Alexander Hauswald:
"Least we know who's it gunna target... Sorta."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien looks at Crystal.
"Whuzzit again?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
It sounds as spooky, but not like the Judge.(To Yuppie b.):
"It's... a shotshell."Crystal Saint Claire:
"...It is clear to me that the power granted to me is not enough."Whitney G. Elieen:
"A very, very potent one."Crystal Saint Claire:
"I am forbidden by law to fire it within city limits, to my knowledge."
"Ah heard 'bout them Revenants bein' blown up wit' dynamita ta high heaven an' coming."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"That may have just been a promise with the owner."Crystal Saint Claire:
"... I'll ask the deadman when we get back if he knows a thing or two about it."Alexander Hauswald:
"I must take sometime after this to spend in prayer. I must request guidance."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Sawnds like a gew idea."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...Thanks, Mitchell. This helps. Ain't much ta work with, but we had nothin' ten minutes ago."Rockett Rimjob:
"This works just fine."Alexander Hauswald:
"We go home. We fortify."
"Yes. Thank you doctor. You have been a God send."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Ain'much? We got th' time, we got th' list a' targets."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"All we need is knowin' how ta kill it."
"So... how much do we know about Revenants?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"When that thing comes, we pump it full of lead and silver until it stops moving."Alexander Hauswald:
"Not how to kill them."
"Who said he'd come ta Dodge? Who said he'd come ta any town in the Midwest specifically?"Rockett Rimjob:

"Let alone how ta kill this thing an' walk away with our own lives."Rockett Rimjob:
"IT's an evil spirit, Crystal."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"It's coming for senior lawmen."Alexander Hauswald:
"We're the senior lawmen."
"...So..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I assume this takes care of what I owe you, Miss Rockett?"Doc Mitchell:
"It's gonna target one of us sooner or later."Alexander Hauswald:
"So... it is an evil spirit..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Ah'll call it square."Rockett Rimjob:
"Guess it's gunna, eeeyup..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Fer sure."Rockett Rimjob:
Actually, you guys are not Senior lawmen.Doc Mitchell:
You're junior lawmen.
The Senior lawmen would be...still in Dodge.
Oh.Alexander Hauswald:
"Which will target senior lawmen..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Cassie-May O'Brien bit her thumb.
"...Overmarshall."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Also, probably that Gallows guy that Mitchell mentioned.Doc Mitchell:
"...Hang on."Alexander Hauswald:
"And... it will do so... why?"Crystal Saint Claire:
Alexander Hauswald looks at Mitchell.
"Who's the sheriff here?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Don't suppose I've got any goodwill left over, do I?"Doc Mitchell:
Doc Mitchell turns from Rockett to Alex.
"Sheriff Sidney."Doc Mitchell:
"Most call him Gallows."
"I assume you can guess why."
"...Guess he's our next visit."Alexander Hauswald:
"Might be hard to find."Doc Mitchell:
"Maybe later, Mitchell. Ah'm a little too rattled ta be handin' out goodwill just yet."Rockett Rimjob:

"'Sides. You might wanna save up for tha supplies those dumbasses are gonna cost ya."Rockett Rimjob:
"...Any idea what?"Alexander Hauswald:
(Charity. Handouts.)Rockett Rimjob:

Cassie-May O'Brien kept biting her thumb for a moment.
"...Why do we assume it's gunna appear 'ere in Dodge?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Left soon after I got here and he questioned me about my coming."Doc Mitchell:
"Assume it was to hunt down what killed Jones."
"..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"...Fantastic."Alexander Hauswald:
"...Welp."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Perhaps he's looking for a way to dispose of this Revenent?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"We sure shoulda ourselves."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"He's more of one to..."Doc Mitchell:
"Where'd Gallows go?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Yew got a direction?"
"I'll head home and ask Deadman. Maybe find a Huckster."Alexander Hauswald:
"Charge into his problems head on."Doc Mitchell:
"Don't rightly know."
"Might be something at his offices."
"When'd he left exactleh? Y'all know nuthin'? Not even direction?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Do you know which, if any, bars he frequented?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Then we head there."Alexander Hauswald:
"But you'll have a hell of a time getting in there with the Confederates clogging it."Doc Mitchell:
"Ah might be able ta help with that."Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers flashes her Ranger star
"...Eeeyup. Guess we ain' got a choice but ta git our asses ta th' Sheriff's office an' have

Nephi "Longiron" Delano peeks out towards the lantern, checking the time on his pocketwatch
No not yet. Though i have the chips for that i believe.Whitney G. Elieen:
AFAIK you have to do that before getting new miracles, but if you read something
otherwise in Fire and Brimstone go ahead.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Looks to be just a regular oil lantern.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Fifteen minutes to midnight.
Is it moving?Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Sitting still.Wonderful Cowboy Land:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano writes a little note on the back of some paper for Rockett that he went out to
investigate a weird light and if he's not back to come looking.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano grabs his gun, sets his hat on his head, and heads out in his hand-me-down
shirt and overalls.
Well, pants with suspenders, but same thing basically.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...darn, wish I had a light..."
Your eyes get used to the night after a few minutes.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
You can't see anything beyond the light though, and if you do try, you'll lose your night eyes.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano pulls out a long-stick match
Nephi is now holding.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
A long stick match.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano keeps it in his right hand, holding his gun in his left.

Wonderful Cowboy Land:
It lights on the first try.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano carries it in his off hand, keeping his rifle over his shoulder with the other,
realizing that he should probably pick up a lantern sometime.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano walks towards the lantern
Which I actually cannot see.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Little to the right and further up.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
""...Ain't this town ever heard of streetlights..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
You did see some streetlights on your way in.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Funny that they aren't lit now.
Must be running low on oil or something.
Couple more feet to the right, the lantern is right there.
There's something next to it.
Glinting in the light.
Must be metal.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks at what's out here.
Looks like the hilt of a knife stuck into the ground.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Looks like a good knife too.
Right next to the lantern.
What do you do Mormon boy?
Nephi "Longiron" Delano leans down to look at the knife handle
"...Why'd someone go stabbin the ground?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Also, can't hear any music, if there's supposed to be some, can you turn it up?
Looks like a good Bowie knife. Custom handle of red and black stone. Smooth to the
touch. nice work.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano raises a curious eyebrow.
"Who the..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Why?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano starts to get suspicious.
A gust of wind blows through and the lantern goes out, so does the match.Wonderful Cowboy Land:

"Long time."The Pale Rider:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano just looks.
"No see."The Pale Rider:
"...You."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
The Pale Rider smiles at Nephi with teeth white as his skin.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano fumbles around with the lantern, trying to get it into a way he could grip it while
also holding onto his rifle, fukken quaking in his shoes.
"Y-you can't be here."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"You ain't real!"
"I be, wherever I have want to be."The Pale Rider:
The Pale Rider walks forward and takes the knife out of Nephi's hands.
"S-stay back!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano jumps back the moment he takes the knife, gun jumping around like a rabbit in
his hands.
"I-I don't need savin this time. You're just a b-b-big g-g-ghost!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
The Pale Rider holds the blade in his left hand and grinds the tip of it into his right palm. He must have
tough skin, because the knife doesn't go through.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has completely frozen otherwise his fingers seemingly refusing to pull the
trigger

"Don't know about that."The Pale Rider:
"Let me see that rifle of yours."
"Y-y-you're gonna... Gonna stay away from my friends."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"N-no dice, pale man."
"I said."The Pale Rider:
"Let. Me. See."
"Be rude to refuse an old friend."
"You ain't a friend! You're some badness from an old dream!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano takes another step back. Still his fingers refuse to pull the trigger.
The Pale Rider advances. His bulk is unnatural in its immensity, and its grace.
Is this... is this Inyanga?(From Poage):
"You're not taking my friends from me. Not again."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

I THOUGHT WHAT WE HAD WAS SPECIAL(From Poage):
"I'M NOT GONNA BE LEFT ALONE AGAIN!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"YOU HEAD RIGHT BACK TO WHATEVER PIT YOU CRAWLED OUTTA, Y'HEAR?"
The Pale Rider grips the end of the rifle with one huge hand and drags it out of Nephi's hands.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano tries to resist!
We don't have an image. He's big. He's pale. Doesn't have a cigar, though. And the knife is an
oddity.

And I can't tell if that's a beard, or a shadow.(From Poage):
The Pale Rider tears the rifle out of Nephi's hand like he isn't even there. He holds it by the middle, nice
and steady. The knife in his right hand flits up and begins carving something into the wood stock.
"That's my old man's gun! Don't you dare!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"D-doesn't matter that the old man's not here, I'm older now!"
"Stronger than I ever b-been!"
"Strong enough?"The Pale Rider:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano keeps saying, but with no gun to back it up.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano seems just inches from crumbling now.
The Pale Rider taps the wood shavings off the gun and hands it back to Nephi.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano takes it and holds it like a child
"Nephi what'n sam hell are you--"Rockett Rimjob:
The Pale Rider turns and walks off into the night with the lantern.

"No cryptic nonsense."
"Don't know. He never was polite enough to give me his name."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Bar's pretty empty."Rockett Rimjob:

"..."Bartender:
Bartender walks through the doors to the kitchen. Sounds of sizzling meat and the nose tingling aroma of
spice drift through to Rockett in a minute or two.
Rockett Rimjob can't help but smile.
Bartender walks back into the room with a plate in his left hand and a few new stains drying on his apron.
He sets the plate down next to Rockett's glass of whiskey.
Bartender crouches down and scrabbles under the bar. He emerges with a bottle of ketchup, spicy
mustard, and a cellar each of salt and pepper.
She takes a gander at the food in front of her, sliding all of the condiments away for the moment.Rockett Rimjob:
Looks to be two fresh fried chicken breasts between two fresh fried buns. Little grease
still on them. There is a sweet herby smell about it.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Rockett Rimjob seems to be pleased with this and the smell. "Not bad. S'pose a deal's a deal."
Rockett Rimjob reaches up and undoes the first few buttons of her corset, and lets her dress slip down off
of her arms. Everything above her belly button is plain for the world to see.
Rockett Rimjob grabs the salt, and trickles a little bit on the cooked breasts.
Wonderful Cowboy Land puts one hand on the bar to steady himself.

Bartender also puts one hand on the bar to steady himself.
"Rumors are true."Bartender:
Rockett Rimjob chuckles a bit, grabbing her fork and prodding at her dish.
"Like what ya see?"Rockett Rimjob:
"Mmmm."Bartender:
"Got a pair of aces."
Rockett Rimjob takes a bite of chicken, chewing slowly and acting a little... -too- pleased by the taste.
"Mmm..."Rockett Rimjob:
Bartender leans back and takes in the sight. His mustache twitches up a little in what might be a grin.
"Not bad... Been a while since Ah've had a decent meal like this."Rockett Rimjob:
"Getting a little hungry maself."Bartender:
"That so?"Rockett Rimjob:
"Such an appetizing display."Bartender:
"Only natural."
"Well. Glad it's nice. But that's all it is, hun."Rockett Rimjob:
"An appetizer," she says, taking another big bite of her chicken. She shakes her body a bit, giving her mounds a
little jiggle.
"And the main course?"Bartender:
"Depends what you want on yer entree."Rockett Rimjob:
"Split peach?"Bartender:
"Hm... Depends on what ya wanna do fer dessert."Rockett Rimjob:
"Thinking something with cream filling."Bartender:
"Hmm... that ain't real cheap. Not at all."Rockett Rimjob:
"You sure you can afford that?"
"I'm a man of wealth and taste."Bartender:
"Man'a taste, huh? Take it you don't want none of that rowdy ramblin' business, then. You seem
like you want a passion treat."
Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob takes another bite.
"Don't know, might be a man of rough taste."Bartender:
Rockett Rimjob raises her brows. "Well. Price depends on a few things, sweetie. Normally folks jus' want
me ta get a little grabby, maybe taste their cookin'. This, though... don't come 'round as often."
Rockett Rimjob:

https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 472/791
"Usually Ah ask fer... somewhere 'round fifty, fer somethin' like that. Full score, rough an' ready, real hands-on
stuff. You, though, Ah might settle fer thirty-five, since this chicken tastes real good."
"You gimme tha full fifty, an' Ah'll stick around a while longer. Show you tha best, give you some pointers. Bump it
ta seventy-five, you got a couple rounds ta do what ya wanna do. You give me five score, an' Ah won't leave 'til
mornin'."
"Ridin' tha smoothest dirt road you'll ever ride's extra. Replace any clothes ya rip, pay fer any medical bills or
accidents. Gettin' rough's fine, but Ah draw tha line -- Ah'll let ya know. Don't break nothin', neither. Try not ta
leave bruises, 's bad fer business."

Rockett Rimjob:
Bartender reaches into his apron pocket and takes out a wad of bills. He counts a few out without looking
at them, then slides them across the table.
Rockett Rimjob grabs the bills and gives it a looksie.
Five tens.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Rockett Rimjob slides the tens right into her dress, below her right pillow.
"Sure thing. Meetin' in mah room? Or d'you wanna take this back ta yer bed?"Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob takes another bite of her chicken.
"Your room's fine."Wonderful Cowboy Land:
*Bartender:
"I'll lock up here after you're done."
Rockett Rimjob starts eating a little faster, and nods once.
"Sure thing."Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob hurries up, eats the last few bites, and slides the plate to the bartender.
Bartender takes the plate and disappears with it to the kitchen. He returns and replaces the condiments
under the bar.
"Finish your drink?"Bartender:
"Yes sir."Rockett Rimjob:
"You ready ta tango?"
Rockett Rimjob stands up off of her stool.
Bartender sets one hand down on the bar and swings himself over.
"Course."Bartender:00000

"Allowed to get handsy?"
"You can grab as much as you like."Rockett Rimjob:
Bartender smacks his hand into Rockett's rump just hard enough to sting. He leaves it there, clutching the
warm, ample globe.
"Lead the way, wayward woman."Bartender:
"--HellOOo, mister Randy...!"Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob smiles wide, and makes her way back up to her room.
Bartender follows Rockett. There is definite upturn to his mustache now, and a hint of some white teeth.

Sacks suddenly sits down beside Rockett. Followed by his owner.
"Sacks seems to like you."Alexander Hauswald:
Rockett Rimjob scratches behind his ears. "That he does. Cute little fella."
"He always this friendly?"Rockett Rimjob:
"Not usually. Nephi, for example."Alexander Hauswald:

Alexander Hauswald looks at the dog.
"...He thinks he's patronizing."Alexander Hauswald:
"Huh."Rockett Rimjob:
"Well, glad Ah made a friend," she says, leaning back in her seat and trying to relax.
"So's he."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald sits down on a nearby seat, just silently looking at Rockett and the dog.
Sacks lazily wags his tail.
"So. How's work been treatin' y'all lately? Haven't ran inta too much trouble, Ah hope."Rockett Rimjob:
"Been silent since we got to Kansas."Alexander Hauswald:
"Before that bandits tried to hijack our train."
"Oh, that sounds like fun."Rockett Rimjob:
"Take it y'all took care'a that mess?"
"Sure did- the others more than me."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald lightly touches the revolver on his holster.
"Not as effective in long ranges."Alexander Hauswald:
Rockett Rimjob nods once. "They seem like folks that don't want nothin' ta do with squabbles."
"Ah don't mind gettin' right into tha action. Up close an' personal."Rockett Rimjob:
"Partly 'cause that's where Ah'm best. Partly 'cause mah eyes aren't that great."
"... That explains the Derringer."Alexander Hauswald:
"Never seen anything like it. Not even back in New York."
"'Cause there ain't nothin' like it. Custom made. Real nice."Rockett Rimjob:
"But yeah. Rifle wouldn't do me much good if Ah can't see more'n ten paces front 'f mah face, yeah?"
"... Hum. You don't show it."Alexander Hauswald:
"Thought about investing in glasses? Sounds like you'd need those."
"Ah used ta have a pair. Got smashed in a bar fight. Realized folks looked at me more when Ah
didn't have 'em on, so Ah left 'em off."
Rockett Rimjob:
"Might get a pair some time down tha road, but Ah can work jus' fine without 'em."
"Fair enough.Alexander Hauswald:
Don't see why glasses would make you less pretty."
Alexander Hauswald is as stoic as ever when he says that.
"Ah think it's 'cause it messes with mah eyes. Makes 'em look way too big fer mah face. Might
block part 'f mah cheeks, too."
Rockett Rimjob:
"Whatever tha case."

Alexander Hauswald forrows his brows.

"Ah've been tryin' ta ferget."Rockett Rimjob:

Alexander Hauswald shrugs, sighing.
"Never had these kinda problems with Thomas."Alexander Hauswald:

Rockett Rimjob lets out a light sigh, closing her eyes for a moment and enjoying her cigar.
"Religion wasn't a big thing for me, no."Alexander Hauswald:
"Religion usually ain't that bad a thing. But if you thought Catholics were eager ta use Jesus as

Alexander Hauswald moves his hand away.

"It's a decent job. Ya move around a lot, keeps ya on yer toes, no shortage of excitement. Pay's
pretty decent, too."
Rockett Rimjob:
"Ah might be a bit of a specialist, though, so it might not be tha same fer you pokes."
"I know. Money's not the problem."Alexander Hauswald:
"I just want to find my brother and head home."

kScotty:
Rockett and Nephi are wandering around the town as night turns into dark. They have
not yet gone back to the saloon to rest and had their strange encounter with the pale man. They are conducting
their investigations into Dodge. It consists largely of walking around waiting for something obvious to fall into their
laps since Nephi is about as sharp as wet dirt and Rockett's eyes don't work too good. However, they are just
lucky enough that something interesting happens by.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
A...what do you call it? Steam wagon? It seems inaccurate for this vehicle. This thing is not a wagon, it is a piece
of art with wheels. It rolls into town with its equally opulent appearing occupant. Greenbacks actually float out of
the back of the thing as it skids to a halt right outside town hall, scaring every horse within a mile.
That's your cue.(To Yuppie b.):
You're here on behalf of the rail company to meet with a few other reps to discuss a pressing
issue on the brothel side of things. Profits have been down low, and you think you know why...
(To Yuppie b.):
Scotty looks up at the wagon with a smile as it approaches to a halt.
*Rockett Rimjob:
The door to this strange metal wagon is opened and from it's depths stepped a woman of
almost ethereal beauty. With a loud clack her foot found the ground below. Dressed in a large white overcoat and
wielding an opulent cane in her gloved hands, the silver haired woman flashed the world a wicked, almost
predatory grin. Her eyes alight with a sharp, dangerous spark that bled into her confident stride.

"...why you gotta be this way, rockett..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Because God an' mah family abandoned me, Nephi," she says plainly.Rockett Rimjob:
"...Fai'nuff."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Figgered..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Rockett Rimjob smiles wickedly.
Natasha, you were already fashionably late to the meeting when you arrived. The others should
be waiting in town hall.
(To Yuppie b.):
"Why not?"Natasha Minayeva :
"You are not bad looking man."
"He's a mormon boy."Rockett Rimjob:
Takes in a deep breathNephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Does he still have penis?"Natasha Minayeva :
"I-"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Oh no, he's packin' some heat."Rockett Rimjob:
"Jus' real religious."
"Darn tootin i d-"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Man is man. Mormon or not."Natasha Minayeva :
"But if you would rather be with Jesus, that is fine."
"Rockett dammit will yew lemme get a word in edgewise without talkin bout mah man
parts?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Never."Rockett Rimjob:
Natasha Minayeva reaches into her pocket
Natasha Minayeva produces a gold pocket watch
Natasha Minayeva clicks it open, looks at the time, and sighs

"Fuck."Natasha Minayeva :
"Ugh. I was about to say. We'd probably be able to get a good lay of the land and i
have way better eyes'n you."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I am late. Can not keep stuffy men waiting forever...if you will be my guest tonight you may
stay by steam wagon."
Natasha Minayeva :
"If you want to come mormon boy...option is there~"
"I hope you screw better than Russian Orthodox."
"...Like david into the lion's den..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano sighs
Natasha Minayeva chuckles like mad
"Anyways...have places to be. Pleasure to meet you all. Will see you..." She says, pointing
her finger at Rockett with a grin. "Later."
Natasha Minayeva :
Natasha Minayeva places the glove back on her hand
"Dangit, Rockett, one'a yew was bad enough."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Of course. Ah'll see you t'night, honey doll~" she coos, nodding at Natasha and tipping her
bonnet.
Rockett Rimjob:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano says, as Natasha heads off.
"Dasvidaniya~" She says with one final grin before striding off towards the town hall.Natasha Minayeva :
Natasha disappears through the doors of town hall. It doesn't look like it should be that
hard to follow her, if you're careful about it. This does seem like good detective work.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Rockett Rimjob doesn't really want to intervene. She can get all the info she wants later tonight, and
doesn't want to risk losing a client that has a goddamn steam wagon.
Natasha passes through the doors of the town hall and continues through a short antechamber
into the circular meeting room. There are two others there. One looks to be the rep from the Baron's branch of the
railroad and the other appears to be from Black River's side of town.
(To Yuppie b.):
There's a clattering of hooves off in the distance from roughly the same direction
Natasha just came.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Rockett Rimjob looks.
It is a jet black wagon with silver embellishments drawn by two pure white horses. It
seems a little bit less sophisticated than Natasha's ride, more old school. Just as fancy though.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
The carriage comes up to town hall and stops.
There is a long pause as the horses spit, neigh, and steam into the open air.
Rockett Rimjob watches.
The door of the carriage slams open and a thin figure dressed in a tasteful black suit,
white shirt, and well oiled black half boots gets out. His hair is supremely styled and his flair is obvious.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"Someone's dressed up in their fancy-pants!" she calls out at him as soon as he steps out.Rockett Rimjob:

"Sorry I am late. Tonight we are here to discuss mutual issues." She says, opting to
stand rather then sit. "This everyone? There should be more."
(From Natasha Minayeva ):
Rickert looks down to Rockett as he descends from his perch.
"Miss Rockett, pleased to make your acquaintance darlin'."Rickert:
"Howdy howdy!"Rockett Rimjob:
"Yer reputation precedes you."Rickert:
Rickert steps down and takes Rockett's hand. He plants a kiss thereupon.
"Aww..."Rockett Rimjob:
"Why thank you."
"Who do Ah owe tha pleasure?"
"Aw, you probly don' know me."Rickert:
"Call me Rickert."
"I'm the one that runs all the show business for Dixie Rails."
"Dixie Rails, huh?"Rockett Rimjob:
what's dixie rails again(From Rockett Rimjob):
"Course."Rickert:
One of the rail companies. It's the one run by General Grant's son. The Confederate bigjobs.(To Scotty):
"I'm here to strut my stuff."Rickert:
"Be the center of attention."
"Lot like you."
"You got some competition t'night, friendo."Rockett Rimjob:
"That so?"Rickert:
"You gonna show me up, or summun else?"
"Honey, who else in tha Americas could stand up ta this?" she asks, swinging her hips a little.Rockett Rimjob:
"We waiting on Dixie Rails bigead." Says the one that appears to be the Baron's girl, judging by
the facial markings, ratty top hat, and staff.
(To Yuppie b.):
"Aw heck another one?" Nephi mumbles under his breathNephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Womanizing bastard." The Black River girl puts in.(To Yuppie b.):
"Rockett, lemme know when yer done introducin yerself to every rich fella in the
county, wontcha?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I imagine I'd be laying down and letting you do all the work, sugar."Rickert:
"Ah yes...man of hour himself! Tell me, why do we not gun him down right here and
now?"

"Ah'd say Ah'd see you in hell, then, Nephi, but you an' Ah are goin' different places."Rockett Rimjob:
"Fucking bastard."(From Natasha Minayeva ):
"Ah sure hope so."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Rockett Rimjob turns back to Rickert. "That so? Well, Ah'm a little booked t'night -- might go fer tha
highest bidder, though."
"Because if we shoot him down, we don't know where he's squirreled away his assets."(To Yuppie b.):
"C'mere, Nephi, fer jus' a second."Rockett Rimjob:
"Well, I may not have the most momey, but I'm a good bou."Rickert:
"Mississippi grown."
Rockett Rimjob beckons him.
Rickert takes a silver watch out of his pants pocket.
beckons Nephi*Rockett Rimjob:
"Shit, see you after the meetin' hun'."Rickert:
"You stay pretty now."
"Can do~"Rockett Rimjob:
"String him up naked as I take him for a ride on my airship. He will talk."(From Natasha Minayeva ):
"What I like to hear."Rickert:
heads overNephi "Longiron" Delano:
Walks into the town hall like he owns the damn place and the business next door too. He twirls the
toothpick between his teeth and he makes his way to the round table and takes a seat. He sprawls into a chair
and kicks one leg up onto the desk. "So, whadda you ladies want of lil' ol' me?"
(To Yuppie b.):
"What?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Rockett Rimjob whispers to nephi
Nephi "Longiron" Delano seems mighty confused... and then flushes completely red and damn near falls
over
"See you two handsome hunks later~"Rockett Rimjob:
"Ah! Yes! Man of the hour! Finally come to grace us with presence..." She says as
she approaches him with a wide smile. "Johnny rebel." As she approaches she clenches her fists and swings for
his face!

"Hoooow fiiiilthy!"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano runs off in the direction Natasha's carriage went off in.
Natasha went into the town hall.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
The punch sails towards him and smacks him square in the jaw. He goes to the floor. He gets up
in a second and returns to his position. The only difference is he's holding a handkerchief to his nose now. The
handkerchief turns a gradual red.
(To Yuppie b.):
Do you go into the town hall?Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"There...with that out of way. We can have healthy conversation." She says as she
moves back to her seat. "So Rickert...what the fuck?"
(From Natasha Minayeva ):
"Well hell sweetie, I usually pay a lady if she's gonna have me flat on the floor."(To Yuppie b.):
"Any of you mind explaining to me this ire you've got for me?"(To Yuppie b.):
I'm back with dinnerNevermore:
Yep.
Nephi heads to town hall.
"You could not have afforded me either way." She says with an excited grin. "And ire
is simple. It is nothing personal...just want to know how it Is you are hogging business so much."
(From Natasha Minayeva ):
"You've been taking girls. Girls that the rest of us could use."(To Yuppie b.):
Nephi, you see a short anteroom, and a door. There are voices coming from the other
side of the door.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Do you peek in and listen?
Of course!Nevermore:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano tries to keep from disturbing whatever is going on.

"I don't know how you think I can be fuckin' that many girls personally."Rickert:
"I'd have to have a god damn long dick to do that."
"Ain't no one got a dick that long."
"Not even Long Dick Johnson."
"I knew him personally."
"But you have lots of experience being dick."Natasha Minayeva :
"He had a fucking long dick."Rickert:
"A massive fucking dick."Natasha Minayeva :
Nephi "Longiron" Delano thinks for a minute.
Was Rickert still outside when Nephi left?Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
He went into the town hall.Kakkik:
Ah, didn't see him leave.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Methinks tricky Ricky aten't operatin' on the right side O' the law."Kakkik:
"Methinks he mights be doing a little press gangins to get he numbers up."
"Now just for the dumb ones in audience, explain "press ganging" here. And just what that
means. Because if it is so...that is low."
Natasha Minayeva :
Lizzie takes a long drag on her cigarillo.
"Disgusting"Natasha Minayeva :
Rockett Rimjob looks at Nephi and tries to gauge his reaction
"He's kidnapping girls or otherwise forcing them into his dirty little operation."Lizzie:
"We don't have any proof, of course."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano had NO idea Rockett was here.
Rockett Rimjob is a few paces away.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano nearly jumps outta his skin when he realizes she's lookin at him.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has to cover his mouth with his hand.
Rockett Rimjob sauters up to the town hall.
"But how else do you explain boom in business?"Natasha Minayeva :
Rockett Rimjob undoes one button on her corset.
"Mile long dick?"Natasha Minayeva :
Rockett Rimjob hikes up her dress a little.
"My natural charm."Rickert:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano gestures quietly to the room where the others are

Rockett Rimjob lets her dress slip a little lower past her shoulders.
Rockett Rimjob saunters on up to the door of the town hall, and steps inside.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano draws a line across his mouth, and does the money sign.
You know the one. Rubbing two fingers together.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Rickert looks over to Rockett as she passes through the door.
"Well hell sugarhips."Rickert:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano stays out of the immediate line of sight until the door is closed again.
"You are a fucking disgusting piece of trash."Natasha Minayeva :
"How you doin'?"Rickert:
Rockett Rimjob looks at Natasha.
"...You got some beef?"Rockett Rimjob:
"We can not prove this bu-"Natasha Minayeva :
Rockett Rimjob looks at Rickert and winks.
Natasha Minayeva looks over
Rockett Rimjob looks back at Natasha.
"I'm bein' accused without a goddamn bit of evidence."Rickert:
"Beef? I am not rancher. This man though is pervert. And not good kind of pervert."Natasha Minayeva :
"Thought it was innocent until proven guilty, not the other way around?"Rickert:
"...care ta explain?"Rockett Rimjob:
"Ah'd rather like ta know jus' who's plannin' on employin' me."
Rockett Rimjob has an agregious amount of cleavage showing, but isn't nipping quite yet.
"He kidnaps girls and forces them to whore themselves o..."Natasha Minayeva :
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is just glad he's looking at Rockett's back and not her front.
Rockett Rimjob 's back is still quite revealing -- you can see the lowest part of her full moon under her
skirt
Rockett Rimjob also has shapely legs and alluring stockings
"Cyka.." Says under her breath.Natasha Minayeva :
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks away for a moment and says a silent prayer for the good lord to give him
strength.

'Coulda jus' said so."
"We will find evidence. Don't you worry. And when we do, even whore of babylon will not

"Is this it? Are we done?"
"Or will you confess your sins and save us all the goddamn time?"
"Well. Seems like miss milk-pale's got some gruff with y'all, so Ah'm gonna get outta her damn

Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob turns right around.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano quietly makes notes on a little bit of paper he's started keeping with him since
the Whitney incident.
"See ya t'night, Rickert."Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob struts right on out.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano watches Rockett strut. Admittedly, even though he knows her to be a raucous,
probably disease-ridden whore... Some dirty thoughts cross his mind.
Rockett Rimjob looks down at Nephi.
"Let's head to tha bar," she says, buttoning back up her corset and making herself a little more
presentable.
Rockett Rimjob:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is squatting there, slav-like, pencil and paper in hand.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano sighs.
"See ya later girlie."Rickert:
"Be thinkin' a you."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano slinks away, quiet as he can, hoping not to be seen by anyone inside.
"And everything you got packed in them clothes."Rickert:
Rickert turns to Natasha.
"Be careful! He might put you in chains and force you to- Actually nevermind. She may enjoy
it."
Natasha Minayeva :
"As for your allegations."Rickert:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano keeps quiet until he and Rockett are well out of earshot of the riches.
"Fraid I'm gonna have to ask you to eat shit."Rickert:

Rockett Rimjob looks back, once they're well out of earshot, then turns to Nephi. "You hear that shit?"
"What'd you hear?"Rockett Rimjob:
"Not much incriminating, but a lot of stuff to go on."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"And I certainly ain't gonna confess to no stuffed shirts that wanna fuck me for my slice of the pie."Rickert:
"...Heh. Heck, I might make a mighty fine journalist some day."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Sell my stories to the Epitaph..."
"Right. What I got so far."
"Rickert's bein accused of press-gangin by what I'm going to guess is some of the other rail barons."
"So you are not going to man up then. Fine. Good and dandy Reble man."Natasha Minayeva :
"Go kidnap a few more girls then. While you can."
"Enjoy it while it lasts, Cyka."
"There are at least four of them here."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Be careful."Rickert:

"Might swing my mile long dick around and knock your pretty lil moneybird outta the sky."Rickert:
"And they're definitely inches from straight-up murderin each other."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"What the heck've we walked into, Rockett?"

"I would love to see you dip your dick in my thorny bush. If I had one still."Natasha Minayeva :
"Right. Well, you do the relaxin, I'll do the thinkin. Sound good?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano taps his noggin with his pencil.
"...You tellin' me Ah can't do no thinkin'?"Rockett Rimjob:
"But I don't fuck rapists like that."Natasha Minayeva :
"Whadaya think Ah am? A dumb mindless slut?"Rockett Rimjob:

"Why don't you drop by the White dragon and I show you?"Natasha Minayeva :
"Ah ain't into peggin'."Rickert:
"But you want to help me puzzle out just what's goin on here, I'm open to help."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"You do have my cordial invitation to Club 99."Rickert:
"Should your starch white shirt and alabaster ass decide to undo your wadded panties."
"I know Dixie Rails is owned by the rebs, just like the Union Pacific is owned by the
Union."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Can't say I'm surprised that Natasha and Rickert want to stab each other with long knives."
"Understood. Speaking of unwadding panties...I am going to fuck off now."Natasha Minayeva :
"Are we done?"

"Two of the ones there, though, I couldn't identify."
"Maybe someone from Iron Dragon or one of the other railroads."
"I would like to tell Rickert to take his mile long prick and make a couple lengths of sausage, but I'm sure
he gets the point."

"You just make sure you know what yer doin when you get involved between these

"Sure, and my name's Genghis Fuckin' Khan."Rickert:

Rickert strolls out of town hall and into his carriage.
"...he is handsome." She says as she wipes some of the blood away from her glove while he
walks away. "Shame he makes his business in rape."
Natasha Minayeva :
"There's a reason railroad runners from both sides of tha Mason-Dixon line pine fer me

Rockett Rimjob:
Natasha Minayeva takes some time to clean the blood away
"Ah'm real good at straddlin' tha fence."Rockett Rimjob:

"Ah'm real good at straddlin' a lotta things."Rockett Rimjob:
"...Was that another innuendo?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...Lord give me strength."
Natasha Minayeva eventually gets up and strolls off once everyone else is gone
"You've been prayin' a lot more'n normal lately, Nephi."Rockett Rimjob:
"You sure you's keepin' them innocent eyes from wanderin'?"
"Well, maybe Whitney's been a good influence on me."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano smirks.

Rockett Rimjob grits her teeth a bit.
"Neat."Rockett Rimjob:
Bartender polishes a mug as he walks over to Nephi and Rockett
Rockett Rimjob seems a little pissed.
Rockett Rimjob turns to the bartender.
"Hey hun."Rockett Rimjob:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano leans back in his seat, and would be chewing bubblegum if any was available.
"Yew got any sasparilla?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Drink?"Bartender:
Bartender nods to Nephi.
"Gimme a tall glass."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Sasparilla sounds pretty good right now, actually. Make it two."Rockett Rimjob:
"But make hers dirty. I think she'd appreciate it."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Not now. Ah ain't yearnin' for any booze just yet."Rockett Rimjob:
"Maybe t'night."
Bartender picks two bottles out from an ice box under the counter and sets them on the bartop.
Bartender lays his hand on each and takes the cap off without a bottle opener. They don't look like twist
offs.
"Ahh, ain't this the life? What a time to be alive. Ice cold drinks in bars across the
country."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"This keeps up, you'll be able to have some in your very own home.:"
"Mmmm."Bartender:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is too busy being able to have fun at Rockett's expense to notice.
She would send someone to fetch rockett a bit later(From Natasha Minayeva ):
Gotcha.(To Yuppie b.):
Cordially(From Natasha Minayeva ):
Rockett Rimjob shrugs, grabs her bottle, nods at the bartender, and takes a sip.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano does much the same.
"Bet that Natasha character has an icebox in her steam wagon."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"What'd you thinka them anyways, Rockett?"
"...look like a good lay."Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob sips
"You think about anythin' else?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Bartender rests his back against the other side of the bar and lets the two converse.
"Like, ever?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"No. Ah'm a mindless whore focused on nothin' but sex."Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob says flatly.
"Ha-hah."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano takes another sip.
Rockett Rimjob seems a little bitter.
"Real good stuff, thanks Bartender."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Rockett Rimjob is just a liiiiittle bitter.
"What's gone and crawled into you?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Dunno. Whatever crawled up mah ass died, though."Rockett Rimjob:

Rockett Rimjob sips.
"...Ah'm sorry I'm givin ya such a hard time."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...S'just how I cope."
"Ain't tha first, won't be tha last. Might as well enjoy yerself while ya do it."Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob sips.
"I am, but..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Yew ain't. And I'm sure ya get enough guano dumped on ya' from every pastor from here to perdition itself."
"I know yew got your reasons fer doin what you do."
"Just like Helaman got his. Life'a sin's real easy. Yew don't gotta think if you don't want to."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano sips
"Ah get it. Ya think Ah'm stupid."Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob sets her empty bottle on the table.
Rockett Rimjob digs a cigar out of her bag, and grabs a match.
Rockett Rimjob stands up, and as she angrily tries to light it, she starts making her way to the rooms in
the back.
"...Naw."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...I think yew made bad choices. Just like we all have."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano finishes his bottle too.
"But we all got the chance to change."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"It ain't too late for yew, Rockett."
"...You don't gotta live like this. Always another way."
"Food for thought, yeah?"
"Burn in hell."Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob says simply, right before closing a door very rudely behind her.
"..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...Ah, women."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano hops off his chair and pulls out a dollar and places it on the counter.
"Fer her drink too, yeah?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano puts his hands in his pockets and slowly walks away from the bar, back towards
his room, unable to sleep.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano then starts doing what he always does when stressed and unable to sleep,
cleaning his guns.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano keeps doing this until very late at night, when he looks out the door, and sees a
single lit lantern...
Nephi "Longiron" Delano could probably stand being interrupted before then, though.
And you might be surprised to see, of all people, the giant and unmistakable figure of Whitney
walking her way in. You could almost hear her footsteps...
Whitney G. Elieen:
"...Whitney?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads to the door and opens it.
"...Yer up late."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen walks forward and nods silently...
"Hey, you alright?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...C'mere, I got some stuff to tell ya."
"And I have things to tell you, son of Joseph."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Where is my sister?"
"...Probably seein to the pleasure of one of the town gentlemen, if I had to guess."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Had a real interestin day out with her today, by the way."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is still mostly dressed, though has ditched his duster for just his shirt and
suspendered pants.
Whitney G. Elieen turns her head around and looks at you. Her eyes red with exaustion. Perhaps
something else as well. "She is not hurt is she?"
"Naw."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...C'mon in. Sit down, you look like yew need it."
"Will some scripture cheer ya'up? I'll read, if ya'd like."
"..." She nods her head and sits herself down. "I do not know the manner of beast we
fight...but I think I know how we may fight it."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"I will...explain later. I would love to hear you read the scripture. Soon."
"Well, s'like my mama always said. We can do all things through Christ, who
strengthens us."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Usually said when she got bit by somethin out in the fields, but still counts."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano gets Whitney one of the blankets from his bed and wraps it around her
shoulders.
Whitney G. Elieen smiles a little at that.
"Always listened to my mama... After all, "I, Nephi, being born of goodly parents..."..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Wise words...reminds me of my mother a little. She used to say such things on our worst of
days."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"First scripture and verse in the Book o'Mormon and my name's in it."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Here, lemme dig up my bible, it's around here somewhere..."
"Where did i leave it..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano starts checking around the room.
Whitney G. Elieen reaches into her own pack
Whitney G. Elieen produces her own
"It is not the book of Mormon but...it will do."Whitney G. Elieen:
"You shoulda seen yer sister today. She did a good job."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Helped get some real good information that'll help us out."
"She was always very talented."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen says softly
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has just produced a holy-hell-that's-so-huge book of scripture why is it so big
Nephi "Longiron" Delano sets it on the table nearest Whitney.
"Son of Joseph. May I confess something to you?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"The combination book. Book of mormon, bible, Pearl of Great Price, and the
doctrines of the-"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Yeah?"
"...I may have had a little more to drink than I should have. Before coming here."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Yew shouldn't dew that. Yer body's a temple, after all. You wouldn't mess up a temple
to god, would ya?"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano sits nearby with the big book in his lap.
Whitney G. Elieen nods her head slowly
"Yes I understand..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"But go on. What's got ya drinkin more than my brother in his dens o'sin?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Whitney G. Elieen opens her mouth as if to say something...only to shut it right after
"...It's yer sister, isn't it?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"You're worried about her."
"...She's been outta yer life fer so long, and now she's close again."
"Yew wanna protect her, do the right thing for her, but'cha don't know how."
"..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Bring her back into the light."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I don't...I don't want her to hate me..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen begins to sniffle
"...There's a parable, in the Book of Mormon about this."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"The story of the Prodigal Son."
"Would ya like to hear it?"
"..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen nods
"Ah don;t got it all memorized, so ah'm paraphrasin a bit here."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Once, a wealthy man had two sons. He was getting on in years. His oldest son had been faithful to his father all
his years, but his youngest was wild, with the strength of youth."
"The youngest son, desiring greatly the things of the world, demanded his inheritance from his father."
"His father agreed after much asking, and his son disappeared off into the world, refusing his father's council."
"The son lived among the men of the world, enjoying all the damning pleasures of sin and money. He had many
friends, and was renowned for his habits and charming personality."
"Until his inheritance started to run dry."
"Soon, he found all his friends leavin' him. They had only stayed to enjoy his wealth
and the sinful delights he could bring them."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"He could find no work, had no skills to survive."
"Soon, he found himself living with the pigs in a sty on a ranch, envying their slop.
"Alone. Worthless. Hated."
"...With the last of his strength, he decided he would return to his father's house and cast himself as a slave, for it
would be better than envying pigs for their slop."
"While he was heading home and still a far off, his father had been watching, and waiting."
"The moment he saw a figure approaching his residence, he had hope without hope,
and he ran to the approaching figure. For you see, the entire time, the father had been watching for his foolish son
who he had thought dead."

"As soon as he recognized his son, he threw himself on him, and embraced him.
"He stank of pig slop, and was caked in mud and rags."
"And he cast himself at his father's feet, and begged to be allowed to become a slave."
"But his father said nay, for this day the Lord had caused his son to come back from the grave."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has started tearing up, just the slightest bit.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano sniffles.
"..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"His father said "Come, son, we will slay the fatted calf, and clothe you in fine raiment,
and I will bless you to reenter my house."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"But the Prodigal Son's brother looked on, outraged."
" "He wastes his inheritance and comes home when it's gone, to a feast?" "
"His father chastised him for this. He said. "You have been good and faithful to me for all these years and do not
think I have forgotten. But this day your brother has returned from the dead."
"Long have I waited, and now my family is whole once more."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks down, then back up at Whitney.
"Ah mighta missed some parts, but that's the gist of it."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"You try to push her, to pull her back, she'll push back just as hard."
"She'll fight yew because she can. Because it's easy. Because she'll think it's right."
"The wages of sin are sadness."
"Sure, it's all fun and games now. Ridin around, gettin treated all fancy by randy men..."
"It's gonna end one day. She's gonna get old, or fat, or crank out more kids'n my mama."
"And if yer there for her, she'll come back t'yew."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"And you'll rejoice."
"...she is like this because of me. Because I pushed her away...she came to me for help and
guidance and instead I..."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"I was...I was just trying to help..."
"I know how ya feel."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Whitney G. Elieen tears up anew, wiping fresh tears away from her eyes.
"I didn't want to...I didn't..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads over, and places a single hand on Whitney's shoulder.
"The road t'hell's paved with good intentions, Whitney..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"But so's the road t'heaven."
"Yer a good girl. Yer tryin to do the right thing."
"That's step one, y'know?"
"Trust in'th lord. He'll help you find the rest o'the way."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano reaches in, and gives Whitney a hug. A very platonic hug.
Whitney G. Elieen wraps her arms around him and squeezes tight
...maybe a bit too tight. Oh dear. You didn't think this through, did you?Whitney G. Elieen:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano gags quietly
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is a scrawny, reedy little thing and easily crushed
Nephi "Longiron" Delano breathes out a squeak
Whitney G. Elieen releases him after a time...
"liiiittle too tight-"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano gasps for air when she releases him.
"...Whew, alright, little bit much there, but ah feel ya."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...I can not be here. T.thank you for comforting me..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Don't be the Prodigal Son's brother, yeah?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"And it's no problem. Anytime."
"Hey, you wanna get together on yer sabbath, read some scripture?"

"Yew show me yers and I'll show yew mine."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...God Bless you Nephi."Whitney G. Elieen:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano smiles in the friendliest way he can manage.
Whitney G. Elieen gets up onto her feet
"You too, Whitney. Lord knows we're both gonna need it."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...Better get outta here before it starts up again."
"...Rockett's in the room next door."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano giggles a bit harder
"..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen looks to the other room and then looks to Nephi. "I can't...I must go. I must...return to
my prayers."
"God bless you this evening...thank you."Whitney G. Elieen:
"...?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano grows a confused look on his face
Whitney G. Elieen supresses yet more tears as she makes her way to the door
"We shall...talk more yes?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Yeah. You gonna be alright?":Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...If God wills it to be..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Goodnight Son of Joseph."
"He always looks out for us, Whitney. Even if you think he's not there."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"He'll never abandon ya."
"Go on. Get some rest."
Whitney G. Elieen smiles a bit before making her way out. Step after heavy step.
"...She's a sweet girl."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano closes the door behind her.
"...Real... Real sweet."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has started sweatin a bit, and takes a single, lingering look in her direction
before heading back to cleaning his guns.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano just waits to hear Rockett getting back to it again...
Nephi "Longiron" Delano waits, annoyed.
Seems she isn't busy.Rockett Rimjob:

No.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"...and that's when the fool tried to spin his gun."Bartender:
"Ended up ruining my wall and blowin' out his kneecap."
"...Impressive."Rockett Rimjob:
Bartender takes Rockett's mug, walks over a few paces, and starts filling it again.
"I kno-"Bartender:
At that moment, a burly man with a step like a muted thunderclap walks into the
saloon. He has a frosty glass tucked under one arm and a set of roses in the other.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Oh God.Rockett Rimjob:
Dobray walks over to Rockett with the inevitability of an oncoming glacier. There is a slight hitch in his
step when he picks up his left leg.
"Howdy partner."Rockett Rimjob:
Dobray bows before Rockett.
Rockett Rimjob offers him a smile.
Rockett Rimjob raises her brows in an equal mount of surprise and befuddled confusion.
"Em here to peek oop for Miz Natasha."Dobray:
"Ei bring floowers."
"Und es cream."
Dobray holds up the roses and what appears to be a glass jar full of homemade ice cream.
"Ees peach."Dobray:
Rockett Rimjob looks at the bartender with a -look.-
Bartender holds his hands up and looks away, absolving himself of any association.
Rockett Rimjob looks back at the burly Russian man.
"...well. Ah thought Ah informed miss Natasha about tha unfortunate... schedulin', of t'night's
affair. She'd have me booked fer too long, hun -- Ah might not'a been able ta get more... urgent, obligations taken
care of."
Rockett Rimjob:
"Ah believe we set up a date fer a few months down tha line in Winnipeg?"
"Much as Ah hate ta turn down such a wonderful gift..."
Rockett Rimjob looks genuinely saddened.
"Ah, vell, you tek rooses und es crem anyveh."Bartender:

Dobray narrows his eyes at Rickert.
"...don't you worry 'bout him none, he was jus' leavin'," she says, reaching up to give him a peck
on the cheek.
Rockett Rimjob:
"You..."Dobray:
"She knows."(From Rockett Rimjob):
"I hef, instruktions foor you."Dobray:
Dobray walks forward towards Rickert and cracks his knuckles.
"I'm sure we can talk this out."Rickert:
Rickert walks forward a step, takes a good look at the Russian's eyes, and decides against it.
"Jody?"Rickert:
"Don't worry boss."Jody Centen:
"I remember you."Dobray:
"Poot heetch in mine leg."
"I'll do the other leg for you."Jody Centen:

"Or d'you got some... ants in yer pants?"Rockett Rimjob:

Rockett Rimjob glances down.

Jody Centen stumbles as the top side of his chest takes a shotgun blast. It looks like someone threw a
pile of bloody ground beef at him.
Rockett Rimjob looks over her shoulder to see what the bartender thinks of this.
"Aright."Rickert:
Bartender watches the display with distaste, though that's probably because he has to clean up after this.
Dobray tucks his shotgun back into his coat.
Dobray walks over to Rickert and pulls a wad of cash out of his left pocket.
"For meedecal beels."Dobray:
Dobray walks over to Jody.
"I think we even now."Dobray:

The three of you head out towards the local graveyard. It is a ways out of town, and
the sun is almost down below the horizon when you arrive. There is a man out amongst the graves. He is bent
over next to a grave whose tombstone is broken in half.

"'Scuse me."Alexander Hauswald:
"Hello!"Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire waves
Whitney G. Elieen bows
Hamilton Hendricks turns his head to look at the folks that just walked up to the graveyard. He pushes
himself up from his crouch next to the grave a moment later.
Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit holds a peppermint stick in his mouth like a cigar.
"What are..."Hamilton Hendricks:
"What are you folks doin' out here?"
"Mr. Hendricks, I assume."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald takes a step closer, offering his hand for shaking.
Hamilton Hendricks wipes gravedirt off his hand and places it in Alex's.
Sacks just sits down, trying to get Lil's peppermint stick.
"...We are looking for you, I believe."Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire stays back.
Alexander Hauswald shakes it, his face stoic.
Alex, you feel something out here. Something off. It might be just be the feeling of being in a
cemetery though.
(To UrbanCritter):
Crystal Saint Claire gently discouraces Sacks from aquiring Peppermint Stick
"Someone said you might help us."Alexander Hauswald:
Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit ain't sharing his delicious peppermint stick.
Alexander Hauswald looks around, uneasy.
"Help you with...what 'sactly?"Hamilton Hendricks:
"I'm...just the gravetender."
"Most people don't pay me no nevermind."
"Someone said you know... things."Alexander Hauswald:
"Things we might have use of."
Hamilton Hendricks backs a few paces away from Alex.
"What...things?"Hamilton Hendricks:
"...Let's call them stranger things."Alexander Hauswald:

"Like, say. Dead people who won't stay dead."
Hamilton Hendricks works his jaw for a few moments. No words come out. He backs up until he's
standing on the dirt of the grave behind him.
"No."Hamilton Hendricks:
"That may not have been a good place to start..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"I don't..."Hamilton Hendricks:
"No."
Alexander Hauswald looks confused. You think.
"I don't have that..."Hamilton Hendricks:
"I don't..."
"I never meant..."

Alexander Hauswald turns to look at Crystal and Whitney.
Crystal Saint Claire holds Bawss a little closer
"Stay near me."Crystal Saint Claire:
"I am concerned."
Hamilton Hendricks one hand pulls at his shirt as he speaks. The other keeps trying to wipe dirt off on his
trousers.
"..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Settle down."Alexander Hauswald:
"You're not in trouble."
"You need not be concerned Mr.Hendricks. My friend speaks true."Whitney G. Elieen:
"We're in a problem and we think you might help us."Alexander Hauswald:

"Who don't?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Who was Cedric?"Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire doesn't look up from the tombstone
Hamilton Hendricks keeps grabbing at his shirt and trying to wipe dirt off on his pants leg. Until Crystal
says the name. He stops moving and looks at Alex. Hamilton's eyes are bloodshot.
"...Get behind me, kid."Alexander Hauswald:
Sacks perks up.
Hamilton Hendricks runs forward and grabs Alex's shirt.
"Wha-!"Alexander Hauswald:
"What are you-- ah!"Crystal Saint Claire:
Whitney G. Elieen steps forward
"Pleasepleasepleasepleasehelphelphelp"Hamilton Hendricks:
Sacks barks and starts running!
"...We'll help. Just calm down."Alexander Hauswald:
Crystal Saint Claire gets knocked slightly forwards, tumbling onto the broken gravestone.
"Ow..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Are you alright Crystal...?"Whitney G. Elieen:

Alexander Hauswald fishes a few rounds and wordlessly hands them to Whitney.
Crystal Saint Claire stands up. "Whitney, I gave you a few little red shotshells earlier... Do you still have
them?"
The dirt on the graves burst outward in a shower of earth and rotten carcasses crawl
out.

tombstone and huddles up next to it.

Remember that and take it into account Crystal.Undead Leadslinger:
Right.
So technically I got no woundsAlexander Hauswald:
Undead Leadslinger throws himself forward with a broken footed gait to ravage Whitney.
Yes.Undead Leadslinger:
Whitney G. Elieen continues to sing, even as a look of horror dawns on her upon seeing the freshly
inflicted wound upon Crystal...

Second bit does one wound of damage as the zombie slashes at Crystal's leg with his yellowed nails.
Same leg, or..?Crystal Saint Claire:
Oh.Undead Leadslinger:
Whitney's leg.
...
Also in that case.
It does no damage.
Due to Whitney's song and Whitney being HUGE.

Whitney G. Elieen keeps on singing as the zombie swipes at her leg and does NOTHING

Whitney G. Elieen looks down at said zombie, towering high above the wretched creature

The final shot sails through the air and enters the thing's forehead with uncommon grace. It digs through
bone, brain, and more bone, before coming out the other end. The bullet looks like a beauteous, freshly sprouted
flower of red.
Cedric:
Cedric lurches forward for a few moments, and falls to the dusty ground in front of Alex. With no living
flesh to actuate it, this nightmare mad material is nothing more than a pile of odorous offal.

"I know as well"Whitney G. Elieen:
Alexander Hauswald pulls out one of the unidentified coins.
"Will this be enough?"Alexander Hauswald:
"That?"???:
Crystal Saint Claire stares at ???'s feet.
"That's a trifle."???:
"Fun to collect, but worthless, in the end."
"I want something real."
"Pay not the demon. The divine benefit I have is more than enought to slay the revenant."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Name your price."Alexander Hauswald:
"What more can you offer that the Lord has not already provided to me?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Whitney, if that was it someone would do it already."Alexander Hauswald:
Whitney G. Elieen shakes her head
"It is not something anyone can do."Whitney G. Elieen:

"Why do you think I asked you for bullets?"
"I want you to make me an offer."???:
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
??? taps Hendrick's body with his shoe.
Crystal Saint Claire steps over towards Hendricks.
"He paid in memories."???:
"I can pay in favours."Alexander Hauswald:
"You help us, I'll help you one day."
"I know the name of the creature and so does God. You will be paying this demon for a boon
we already have"
Whitney G. Elieen:
"And, unlike the help I get, his comes with a price "
"...Whitney."Alexander Hauswald:
"If you knew all along."
Crystal Saint Claire pokes at Hendricks.
"Why'd we come here?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Is he dead?"Crystal Saint Claire:
??? looks at Alex for a while. His foot taps the ground to a short rhythm. Then stops. He turns to Crystal.
"His brain is."???:
"...forever?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Yes."???:
??? turns to Alex.
"I thought we could learn more of this demon. The ability to kill is with me already. But further
knowledge of what we face can help with the work."
Whitney G. Elieen:
??? offers a red gloved hand.
"I accept."???:
"...Do you take all the memories?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"That is why I came h-"Whitney G. Elieen:
Alexander Hauswald looks at Whitney.
Whitney G. Elieen grits her teeth
Alexander Hauswald looks at the demon.
"Let's rephrase the contract a bit."Alexander Hauswald:

"Or... can you pick, and choose?"Crystal Saint Claire:
??? lets his hand fall to his side.
Crystal Saint Claire takes some paper from her bag.
"A favor's very valuable."Alexander Hauswald:
"I took the best ones first."???:
Crystal Saint Claire offers Hauswald a paper, and pencil, and a little board to write against.
"Those that he would give."???:
"Then I took the rest."
"As he kept asking for favors."
"Until there was nothing left."
"Are you able... to look? Just look?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Look at, what?"???:
"Memories."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Right. We need to know."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald takes a deep breath.
"Yes."???:
"I know what you want already."
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"What are we fighting? How do we kill it? How do we make sure it'll stay dead?"Alexander Hauswald:
"..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Crystal Saint Claire starts writing.
"The favor can be valuable."???:
"That's first."Alexander Hauswald:
She's basically writing a contract.(From Crystal Saint Claire):
"Second, the favor."Alexander Hauswald:
"If and when you come cashing it in."
"...may I intercede?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"I don't want any-"Alexander Hauswald:
??? holds a hand to Crystal.
"Feel free."Alexander Hauswald:
"Let me finish with Mister Hauswald first."???:

https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 556/791
Crystal Saint Claire continues writing.
"But this pertains to his contract, sir."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Does it?"???:
"Crystal..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Yes, sir. I would like to add a clause stating that Mr. Hauswald's present alliances, at the
time of the favor's calling, would take precedence over any obligations brought upon him by the favor."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"No."???:
"To put it simply, it's just a clause that would prevent you from having him shoot us in the
back."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"We can change some of the wording, if you'd like..."
"The favor will be carte blanche."???:
"That too. When I take the bargain, I don't want to end up suffering for it."Alexander Hauswald:
"If you want what you're asking for."???:
"That is... a rather steep price for three questions, is it not?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"I don't want to end up with something like, say, going on a shootout and finding out I shot
Whitney."
Alexander Hauswald:
"If you want something without suffering for it, I'm afraid you're talking to the wrong person."???:
Crystal Saint Claire sighs.
"I want a fair price."Alexander Hauswald:
"You have my price."???:
"Which is as fair as it comes."
Crystal Saint Claire continues writing.
(Be back in a bit)???:
"So, carte blanche favor... in exhange for the answers, in writing, to the three queries posed
below?"
Crystal Saint Claire:
"When you come cashing in, I won't betray my friends or their friends. That's my only
demand."
Alexander Hauswald:
"Alexander..." She says, turning her head to the huckster. Her expression one of
overwhelming concern.
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Whitney."Alexander Hauswald:
"Please...think this through..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"This demon can bring you only suffering in the end..."
"Already had my suffering."Alexander Hauswald:

For later, the three quesries are a request for information regarding the revenant
(origin, any particular strengths or weaknesses, and its preferred strategies), how to PUT it down, and how to
KEEP it down afterwards.
(From Crystal Saint Claire):
"If others don't as a result, I don't mind."Alexander Hauswald:
"...Are you certain of this?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"I have... a draft here. Factoring in Mr. Hauswald's stipulation, this demon's desires, and a
precise quantification of the trade. There are still SOME ways this could be abused, but I've tried to take away
some of the more egregious offenses."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"For example, if the favor was signing into some larger, more elaborate deal designed to further ensnare you, that
would go against this draft."
"The favor would be non-transferrable."
"He can't make me sign a deal like that."Alexander Hauswald:
"It's not how it works."
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"...i do not understand most of this, but I understand contractual law..."
"...It follows a more...infernal set of rules Crystal."Whitney G. Elieen:
"It is more akin to a shady casino then a true court of law."
"He can't back out on his deals. But he can and will twist the words as much as he can."Alexander Hauswald:
"...then agreeing to a carte blanch means he can ask you to do literally anything of which
you are capable."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"Correct."Alexander Hauswald:
"And you are completely capable of entering a contract, as we have just seen, no?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"It could be considered as forcing you into a contract, but this is not a court of law."
"You got a point."Alexander Hauswald:
"Name your favor, demon."
"...He has said he wishes it to remain somewhat nebulous... I believe there should just be a
few stipulations preventing obvious infractions."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"Such as?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Not bringing you into new contracts with it, or pressuring you into a situation in which the
only solution is to make a contract..."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"...Not... um..."
"...I do not know the rules they play by, so it is difficult to create a contract adhering to them..."
(Gtg Harrygame starting in t-minus... soon.)
(C'mon. Let's finish this soon.)Alexander Hauswald:

pocket of his suit.

"Here's my terms, demon."Alexander Hauswald:
"I won't betray my friends and I won't agree to new deals with the favor."
??? takes out a yellowed piece of parchment and a quill.
"That is covered..."Crystal Saint Claire:
??? dips the quill into one of the eye sockets of the cow skull. It comes back stained with red.
??? scribbles something onto the paper, blows on it, and rolls it into a scroll.
??? extends his red gloved hand again.
"Show me the scroll."Alexander Hauswald:
"I'm afraid I can't, until our deal is finalized."???:
"You're not the first to try and burn me."
"Do I have your word it's what we agreed on?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Yes."???:
"Then fine."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald shakes the demon's hand with his left hand.
"We have a deal, demon."Alexander Hauswald:
??? retracts his hand and offers the scroll.
"We do."???:
Alexander Hauswald reads it.
"To kill a thing that is not, one must first the crux of its existence plot. Delve into the heart of the matter to
cause the Revenant a splatter."
???:
"...So we shoot it in the heart to kill it."Alexander Hauswald:
"You've got your information, and I have a favor."???:
"Name it."Alexander Hauswald:
"I will."???:
"When I collect."
??? reaches down and takes something out of Hendrick's pocket. He gives it to Alex.
"You might could use this."???:
Alexander Hauswald grabs it.
"What's this?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Find out."???:
??? holds up a hand.

Alexander Hauswald examines his object.
"See you soon."???:
??? walks back towards where he came from and turns around the tombstone.
It appears to be a small journal.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Most of the pages are boring, all about Hendricks and his beau to be.
Alexander Hauswald will examine it when he gets back.
The latter pages have some more interesting information.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
The most familiar of which is the symbol written in blood at Hendrick's feet.
An unbounded star.
It appears many times.
Interesting.Alexander Hauswald:
I assume that with that they head home?
Unless you want to do anything else here.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Nnnnope.Alexander Hauswald:
Except maybe make poor Hendrick comfortable.
He'll be fine.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
He's already in a graveyard.
Alright.Alexander Hauswald:

No. There were other things I wanted to do.(From Scotty):
Righto, any idea of what?(To Scotty):
I want to roll seduction and do some dirty-talking, ideally as if the prospect of beating women and
forcing them in-line arouses her, to try and find out if Rickert really is that level of scumbaggery.

Rickert slides the troublesome garment down Rockett's shapely legs with experienced hands. His
eyes never break contact with Rockett's. Though his smile does get wider once Rockett's panties are around her
ankles.

over sun touched cheek, down the hollows of her throat, and stops just above the fullness of her bosom.
(To Scotty):
"You wanna get bit sugar?"Rickert:
"Cause you got ma rattle shakin'."
Rockett Rimjob looks at him with an absolutely lecherous countenance, letting out a hot breath right into
his face.

"You want me to get back to my titillatin' tale?"Rickert:
"Or are you otherwise entertained?"
"A little chit-chat never hurt no-one..."Rockett Rimjob:
Rickert uses one deft hand to unbuckle his black trousers. It takes a good tug to get them to
fall.When they pass his calves, something meaty, warm, and thick springs up into the crevice of Rockett's shapely
butt.
(To Scotty):
"Well, I decided to make little Miss Rita an offer she couldn't refuse."Rickert:
"Fame, fortune, a place on the stage."
"Sweet things like that."
"Little girl's eyes got so wide."
"Like dinnerplates."
"Cute lil thang."
"...damn, you really are packin'..."Rockett Rimjob:
"...so what'd little miss cute end up doin', then? She say yes?"
Without even so much as a hint or gesture from Rickert as to what to do, Rockett grinds
her ass up against his meat, arcing her back and subtly spreading her legs.

Since this is an opposed roll to Rickert's seduction skill.Rickert:
ohRockett Rimjob:
And you didn't beat him by that much this time.Rickert:
that'sRockett Rimjob:
concerning
It should be.Rickert:
"Course she did sugar."
"With a carrot like that danglin' in front of her."
"No kiddin'..."Rockett Rimjob:
Rickert hums in pleasure as Rockett starts to grind on his tool. He gently undoes Rockett's shirt and
takes hold of her left breast with his hand. His fingers are calloused. They feel rough when tweaks Rockett's nipple
and squeezes her generous titflesh.
(To Scotty):
"I got her some cash and got her motivated towards my club."Rickert:
"So I could take care of her, proper like."
"She do good work?"Rockett Rimjob:
"From what she showed me, I could tell she had talent."Rickert:
"Silvery voice."
"...and a golden throat."
She takes in a deep breath as he grabs her funbag, looking up at him over her shoulder
as her hips rock up and down. She keeps herself steady, hands planted on the mattress.
(From Rockett Rimjob):
"Knew how ta take it?"Rockett Rimjob:
"Not at first, but she picked it up fast."Rickert:
"She...ascertained from my reactions, what was a good idea, and what was a bad idea."
Rickert continues to tease Rockett's breasts with gentle squeezes and pinches. He pulls his hips
back from hers slow, until the tip of his length is barely touching Rockett's hot mound.
(To Scotty):
"Take it y--nnh... y' had ta do some... convincin'? Lord knows throatin' don't come easy..."Rockett Rimjob:
"Well, when you got money in one hand, fame in the other, and good looks..."Rickert:
Her body sloooowly pushes back, grinding Rickert's head against her sex, slipping along
her lips and slickening it with her juices. She doesn't give him the pleasure of penetration, however -- once their
hips meet, he'd feel the soft skin of her belly on his length.
(From Rockett Rimjob):
"It tends to make the convincin' a little easier."Rickert:
"You bad little girl, playing with me like that."
"I'll have to return the favor."
"Money's a hell of a talker..."Rockett Rimjob:

"...this, thing, though..."
"...maybe Ah jus' wanna have some fun~"
Rickert's finger slides over Rockett's dripping cunny. He finds her button after a few seconds of
stroking and begins to run a light finger over it. The mattress squeaks as he shifts and the finger against her
button is replaced by an agile tongue.
(To Scotty):
"Well maybe..."Rickert:
Rickert takes a nice, long, langorous lick of Rockett's sizzling slit.(To Scotty):
"I can help you out with that."Rickert:
Alright.Wonderful Cowboy Land:

Callie and Cassie find the re-purposed marshalry close to Doc Mitchell's cabin. There are guns sticking out the

Manson strolls around the corner of the building with a rifle stock pressed to his shoulder. He looks like
he's wearing a mask, but he's cut a hole in the mouthpiece tor a cigarette.
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers gives him a small wave as she approaches, hands nowhere near her gun or
whip. "Howdy there!"
Manson shakes his head until the smoking cigarette drops from his mouth. He puts the sights of his rifle
on Callie.
"Business?"Manson:
"Jus' here ta talk. We don' want no trouble now."Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"Talk 'bout what?"Manson:
"Well, Ah heard tell of some Southerners like myself holed up here and figgered y'all
must feel a might far from home."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"Feelin' fine."Manson:
"And I got enough bastard to shoot the shit with in there."
Manson jerks his head towards the building.
"So, you're looking like good target practice."Manson:
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers shows her star. "Y'all wouldn't shoot a Ranger down in cold blood, would ya?
Names Corporal Callie Mathers of the Texas Rangers."
Cassie-May O'Brien rests the butt of her shotgun on her hip, keeping the flag up.
Manson doesn't respond for a moment. The rifle moves a bit further back against his shoulder. Then, a
white gloved hand reaches around the building and touches the masked man on the shoulder.
"What?"Manson:
"..."
Manson lets the rifle drop to his side with clear irritation. He walks back around the side of the building. A
door slams loud enough for both Callie and Cassie to hear.
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers smirks. "Well, ain't he just a people-person?"
A man wearing a well pressed Confederate uniform walks around the corner of the
building. He has a pistol and saber belted to his hips. His mustache is impeccable. One white gloved hand raises
in greeting.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"Hello madam."The Major:
Cassie-May O'Brien wave-waves the flag a little, raising her eyebrows.
"I hope that I may apologize for the behavior of my man."The Major:
"He's been a little cagey, as of late."
"T'ain't nothin'. With times as they are, makes sense ta be a little wary."Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"That it does."The Major:

"Jus' lendin' a helpin' hand ta the Marshalry. Ah could ask y'all the same question.
What's a buncha fine Southern folk doin' holed up in these parts?"
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
The Major lowers his head and grinds his boot into the dirt for a few moments. He raises his boot and
stamps the soil underneath him down flat. He raises his head back up.
"I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to say."The Major:
"Circumstances arose, and we were...called to action. Here."
"An' the hostility to the locals? Ah'm sure they'd be more'n willin' ta help if they didn't

ta let 'em know they gotta stay clear and there'd be far less trouble. 'Specially if ya got a Ranger backin' ya up."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
The Major strokes his beard.
"Perhaps."The Major:
The Major points to Cassie.
"What affiliation is your friend there?"The Major:
"That's Cassie. She's also helpin' out the Marshalry. She'd jus' fine, far as Ah'm
concerened."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"Howdy."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"That is wonderful, but I would like to know her relation to the Confederacy."The Major:
"Sympathizer, another Ranger perhaps?"
Cassie-May O'Brien looked over at Callie.
"Naw, she's not a Ranger and she wasn't blessed ta come from Dixie. But she's the
kinda gal ta help anyone who needs it."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
The Major strokes his mustache for a solid minute.

"Miss Ranger, you may come inside."The Major:
"I'm afraid that I would be more comfortable with your friend outside."
"She can talk to Fenwick."
"Is that agreeable?"
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers thinks for a moment. "Cassie, that fine with ya?"
"Who's Fenwick again?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"He's our requisitions officer."The Major:
"Or, a quartermaster."
"...Uh."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Sure, Ah guess?"
"Follow me, if you will."The Major:
The Major turns and walks around the corner of the building.
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers follows
"...keep her entertained."The Major:
"Oh, you know me."Fenwick:
"Always the ladies man."
"Miss... I didn't quite catch your name."The Major:
"Who,meh?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I was interested in the Ranger."The Major:
"She told me your name, Miss Cassie."
"Ah'm Corporal Callie Mathers, sir. An' what might yer name be?"Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"Major William Sutherland."The Major:
The Major extends a hand to the bald, heavily scarred man next to him.
"And this is mister Fenwick."Fenwick:
Fenwick gives a jerky wave.
"Pleased to meet yer."Fenwick:
"Cassie-May, sugercube. Pleasure's all mahne."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Aye, I'll be talking to you while Suthers gives the Ranger the run of our spot O' heaven here."Fenwick:
"Hope you don' mind."
"Nuthin' bad 'bout it, sugercube. Jus' git mah friend outta there in one piece, eh?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Oh, she'll be fine."Fenwick:
"Long as she sticks with Suthers."

"He couldn' hurt a fly."
'"Aw shucks, so tha' 'stache ain' jus' fer show?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Fenwick walks out and leans against the stone wall.
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers nods and steps inside
"I hit a target this week."The Major:
"I might even hit two."
"...Think Ah can git this down now,"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien put her shoygun between her legs and untied the white blouse off it.
The Major throws out a hand towards the young soldier sitting on the bench just inside.
"This is Mannok, he's the only private in our unit. Little skittish sometimes, but a good boy."The Major:
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers tips her hat to him. "Howdy."
Mannok looks up to Callie. His eyes have obvious bags under them. His head nods its way back down a
second later.
Cassie-May O'Brien folded her blouse and stuffed it back in her backpack.
"...So, quartermaster, eh?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"He's just a little tired is all."The Major:
"Come along now."
The Major strides further into the building.
"Aye, I handle all the goods 'round this crew."Fenwick:
"What d'ye do with yerself?"
Cassie-May O'Brien put her shotgun back in the sling, then shrugged.
"Taggin' 'long mah friend, lookin' fer trouble an' a penny ta come mah way. Yew know how it
is."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
"This is Mister Mundt."The Major:
"He's our resident scientist."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers tips her hat to him as well
Mundt Fedler turns to look at Callie. His gloves are stained with black grease, as is the rest of him.
"Guten tag, frau."Mundt Fedler:
Mundt Fedler turns back to the Gatling gun and continues greasing the mechanisms with a curious little
gun.
"Aye, I know better than most."Fenwick:
"Why d'ye think I'm the one that handle all the goodies?"
"Skim a little milk offa top sometime."

"Part and parcel of tha job."
"I believe you've already met Mister Manson."The Major:
"Eeeeyup. Think y'all got some fags in tha' skimmed milk, sugercube?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien grinned.
"Coulda share a smoke."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Manson doesn't look up. He concentrates on guzzling the contents of a large brown jug.
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers nods. "Yep, gave us quite the welcome."
Fenwick sighs theatrically and digs around in his interior coat pocket.
"AH suppose."Fenwick:
Fenwick pulls out a crinkled rolling paper and a tin of tobacco. He has a cigarette rolled up in under a
minute.
"Musta git boring 'ere."Cassie-May O'Brien:
The Major walks a little bit further, closer to the cots set up at the back wall.
"And the two wonderful men operating the Gatling guns."The Major:
"Mayesby and Jeziah."
"Right pleasure Miss."Mayesby:
"Always did respec' the Rangers."
Mayesby touches the brim of his hat in reverence.
"Didn't happen to bring any booze with her did she?"Jeziah Stone:
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers smiles. "Ya flatter me, sir. An' Ah don' have any drinks, but Ah do have a couple
cigars."
"Shiiiit, I don't smoke."Jeziah Stone:
"Thas Manson."
"We 'ave our fair share a excitement."Fenwick:
Fenwick offers the cigarette to Cassie.
"Realleh now? Ah coulda use a gewd story!"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien took it gratefully and put in her mouth, lighting up with a match she produced out.
"Nex' time Ah'm in town, Ah'll see if Ah can't get someone ta bring some drinks up
courtesy of the Rangers."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"That would be mighty kind of you Miss Caliie, but I couldn't impose so upon you."The Major:
"We will do just fine by ourselves up here."
"Aye, had a lil show t'other day."Fenwick:

"Show?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Middle of the night Sally starts screaming 'er fookin' head off."Fenwick:
"She's one a them..."
"Splosive specialist."
"Demolitions."
"Wouldn't be no trouble fer me. Plus, you boys look a might thirsty."Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
The Major puts one hand to Callie's shoulder.
"I'm afraid I must refuse."The Major:
"It would be against my honor to accept a gift without giving one in return."
"Whut wuz she screamin' fer?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Danno."Fenwick:
"Parently, sum feckin' huge munster came out of the dark and sliced her right good cross 'er chest."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers thinks for a minute. "How's about this then. If yer willin' ta talk to the locals an'
work somethin' out so they don' see y'all as jus' some Rebs holed up with some guns, Ah'll make sure
y'all have plenty of drinks fer however long yer in the area."
"Monster, eh?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I'm sure some understanding can be reached with the locals."The Major:
"You needn't worry on that account."
"Aye."Fenwick:
"Pale, eyes white as a fuckin' chicken egg."
"Teeth like a tiger."
"And it left a smell around like a weeks worth of latrine mess."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers smiles and holds out her hand. "Then is that a deal?"
"...Huh. How big wuz it?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Of course Miss Callie."The Major:
"A deal."
The Major offers his hand.
"Feck, I dunno."Fenwick:
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers shakes it
"Wasna there ta see it."Fenwick:
"...Hurm."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien digs through her mental library of critters. Rings any bells?
"I take it everything was to your satisfaction?"The Major:

"Course. Ah figgered everythin' was jus' some big misunderstandin'. An' Ah'm glad
we could come ta a peaceful resolution."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
Vampire, could be a couple other things, but vampire is the first thing that comes to
mind. Pale, big teeth, usually smell like shit like all undead.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
(Gotta get ready for work before too long. Also, should I get pizza or wings for my 12-
hour shift?)
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"Wonderful Miss Callie."The Major:
"I shall see you to the door."

"...Sounds like sumthin' outta vampire storybook."
"Hey, yew know tha' Rockett Rimjob

(They're from Wings 2 Go)Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"Nah shit?"Fenwick:
"Ah know on a good authority."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers tips her hat. "Ah hope ta hear that y'all and the locals have settled things soon,
Major."
"Goodbye Miss Callie, I'm sure we'll see each other again."The Major:
The Major doffs his cap and holds it to his chest.
"Gonna hafta see if she'll let me take a slice of 'er peach cobbler."Fenwick:
"Fer right price?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers smiles and steps out. "Until nex' time, Major!"
"Indeed."The Major:
"Fenwick, finish up with Miss Cassie."
"I'm sure she has places to be."0

"Keap yer panties on ye pushy blighter."Fenwick:
"Hyuk!"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Fenwick bows in front of Cassie.
"Cheers for now girl."Fenwick:
"Thanks fer sumthin' ta put in mah mouth, sugercube."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien moved the cigarette from one corner of her mouth to the other and offered a
handshake.
Fenwick shakes Cassie's hand with vigor.
"Not a problem."Fenwick:
"Give ye somethin' else ta stick in, if ye want."
"Yew wish, eh?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Fenwick grins. His scars stand out when he grins. Ugly red things around the side of his mouth and
around his eyes. He reaches a hand up to touch the brim of an invisible cap and departs.
That's all for now.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"...So, y'all got anythin' useful, Callie?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Yep. Seems ta all be a misunderstandin' an' they're gonna talk to the locals, try ta
sort everythin' out."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

Alright.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Extra stuff done.
good goodYuppie b.:
Wonderful Cowboy Land brings WHitney a long, tall, cool, glass of water. A slight frown creases his face
as he sets it down in front of the adventist.
*Bartender:
"Thank you..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen grasps the small glass in her much larger hands
"Nothin' else...?"Bartender:
"...do you...do you sell Cider by chance?"Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen carefully lifts the glass up to her lips
Whitney G. Elieen sips
"I got a couple kegs."Bartender:
"I would like one glass of Cider please."Whitney G. Elieen:
Bartender strolls a few feet over and grabs a mug off the bar's counter. He bends down. Gurgling noises
drift up from under the edge of the bar.
Whitney G. Elieen takes another sip before setting the glass down
Whitney G. Elieen takes a deep breath in
Whitney G. Elieen slowly lets it out
Bartender comes back up with a frothy mug. He walks back over to Whitney and sets it down in front of
her. The crackle of carbonation is still audible.00000

"Quarter."Bartender:
Whitney G. Elieen gives him said quarter
"God bless."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen slides the water away and replaces with the apple drink
Bartender slides the quarter across the wooden counter top. The shining piece of currency slips into his
apron pocket with a difficult to discern whisper of metal on cloth.
The froth in the mug is settling out a little. The actual liquid is a pale yellow filled with
tiny bubbles.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Whitney G. Elieen stares at the bubbly drink in the mug, almost mesmerized by the carbonation as she
lifts the glass slowly up to her lips.
Whitney G. Elieen closes her eyes and mumbles to herself. A silent prayer perhaps before she lifts it to
her lips and drinks deeply.
The liquid tickles the tongue as it flows down. There is a slight burn to it, but it is
difficult to feel amidst the tickling bubbles. Sweet and bright, with a minute bitterness that follows behind. The drink
feels autumnal as the red and orange of dying leaves.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"Good?"Bartender:
Whitney G. Elieen sets the glass down after a time. She would drink this as sensibly as she could. There
was a certain beauty to the drink. One that called to mind thoughts of autumn. Of falling leaves and dying
trees...
Whitney G. Elieen looks up and smiles
"Yes...very."Whitney G. Elieen:
Bartender gives a short grunt of approval. His idle hands grab an empty mug off the counter. He grabs a
stained white cloth off his shoulder and begins polishing the mug.
"I imagine this drink is popular this time of year. I think I like it better than the others..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Popular all year round."Bartender:
"After years of drinking water alone, it feels refreshing to have something different."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Mmmm."Bartender:
"Only water?"
"Only water."Whitney G. Elieen:
"The body is a temple. I try to tend to it well."
"Hmmm."Bartender:
"Why the change?"
"...lately things have become stressful."Whitney G. Elieen:
"More than usual I should say."
"I like to think God allows these indulgences from time to time for her servants."

https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 597/791
"Maybe."Bartender:
"More stressful?"
"Yes..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen glances down at the drink in her hands
Whitney G. Elieen slowly raises it for another sip
"More stressful...far more stressful."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Mmmm."Bartender:
"Do what I can to help."
There's not much left in the mug Whitney. Conservative drinking and eating was never
your strong suit. It isn't helped by the thirst and hunger that matches your size.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"May I have another please?"
Bartender takes the mug and looks into it for a long second. He shrugs, walks over to the keg under the
bar, and fills it back up. The refreshed mug is before Whitney in less than a minute.
Whitney G. Elieen grabs the newly filled mug
Whitney G. Elieen brings it to her lips
Whitney G. Elieen drinks again
Whitney G. Elieen sets it down after a hearty "sip"

Bartender looks at the empty mug for a bit longer this time.
"Right."Bartender:
Bartender ransacks the bartop for a larger mug, ensures it is clean, and fills it full of cider. He sets it down
before Whitney two seconds later. He keeps a wary eye on her.
"Quarter for the last mug."Bartender:
"Half dollar for this one."
Whitney G. Elieen sets the money down on the counter
"Thank you...and God bless."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen grabs the much larger mug
Whitney G. Elieen brings it up to her lips

That drink is far more conservative. You still have some left after.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Whitney G. Elieen sets it down after one good sip. There was still some left in the mug at least...
"...have things always been so strange around here?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Strange, how?"Wonderful Cowboy Land:
*Bartender:
"The risen dead. Demons. Revenants..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"...me"
Bartender shrugs his wide shoulders.
"Heard all sorts a stories."Bartender:
"Before an after the quake."
"The end times approach. The time of the second coming is close."Whitney G. Elieen:
"But why now? Why this time? I serve the will of God, yet I can't confess to know her thinking."
Whitney G. Elieen takes another drink of her sweet and bitter beverage

Whitney G. Elieen lifts it up
Bartender watches with interest as the mug fills of its own accord and Whitney lifts it into the air.
"Sage advice. All I needed was to ask."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen lifts it to her lips and drinks
Whitney G. Elieen sets the holy mug down soon after

Bartender:
Whitney G. Elieen slides it over to the bartender, along with another half dollar. "Care for a drink?"
Bartender takes the half dollar, keeping his hand well away from the mug.
"I'm good."Bartender:
"There are times when I doubt my place here...when everything seems so..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Terrible. Frightening."
"And every time God has shown me she can still do better."
"Seems to've taken a shine to you."Bartender:
"She has. She has shown me so many wonderful things...and has let me do my fair share as
well."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Five years of wandering alone, ever since my family's ascension. God is the one thing that has kept me
grounded."
"She has blessed me with her power. Blessed me with company, with food and drink whenever I need it."
"Maybe someday she will..."
"..."
Whitney G. Elieen grips the mug
Whitney G. Elieen pulls it to herself
"Will?"Bartender:
"Maybe someday she will bless me with my family back too."Whitney G. Elieen:
"It seems impossible now but..."
Whitney G. Elieen runs a hand across the humming glass
"Some things ain't meant to come back once they're gone."Bartender:
"It is not my parents that I refer to."Whitney G. Elieen:

"A sister. Someone I was close to..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"...once."
"Now?"Bartender:
"..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen shifts her eyes downward
Whitney G. Elieen grips the mug with both her hands
"...she is like a stranger to me now."Whitney G. Elieen:
"And to her I am worse."
"Hmmm."Bartender:
"How you gonna fix it?"
"...first Corinthians 13.2. If I do not have love, I have nothing. I can move mountains, restore
entire legs, command the earth and the sky..."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"...fill my drink back up and imbue this mug with holy power."
"...but without love it is nothing. I do not know."
"It will be a miracle if I can, and not of the kind you have seen just now."
"...how can I fix it? She hates me. She hates all that I believe in. I want desperately for things to be right
again...but no love, no dice."
"What's got between you and her love?"Bartender:
"She came to me once, seeking asylum. I gave her...a poor answer. I thought I was helping
her...but I did just the opposite."
Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen lifts her hair up to show the scar that it hides
"All other scars have healed. The ones father gave me. The ones I gain now. All but this one."Whitney G. Elieen:
Bartender peers at the scar. One hand rubs his chin as he does.
"What can you do to make it right?"Bartender:
"...I do not know. My faith angers her. My presence angers her. I want to set it right but I don't
know what to say."
Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen lets the hair fall back down.
"I want to tell her that I am sorry. That I didn't mean to hurt her so. But...she will not listen. Not
to me."

"My advice?"Bartender:
"Hmmm?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Price needs to be paid."Bartender:
"In the currency everyone understands."
"Sufferin'."

the years."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Suffer for her?"Bartender:

"...I would. Something tells me I will."
"Hmmm."Bartender:

some info out of her. Further investigate the disappearance of the town marshal, Sydney Gallows. Third option is
to get really drunk and have a duel with each other.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Can we do 3, 1, and then 2?Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
Well.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
You're the players.
You tell me.
I'm just a skyskull.
Anyone else got something to add?Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
I think 'get drunk' should not be Option One.Poage:
Make a plan on how to kill the magic ghost man?Alexander Hauswald:
It's not.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
It's option three.
Step one, thenPoage:
"...We got answers on how to kill that thing."Alexander Hauswald:
Bartender polishes a mug behind the bar. He kicks the kegs under it off and on to sound out how full they
are.
"Answers aside from 'Jus' shoot it a lot an' hoipe it stays down'?"Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
*hope
"... It's something like that."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald touches his chest with one finger.
"We need to put a bullet right in its heart or it'll come back."Alexander Hauswald:
"That Ah can do."Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"That is nebulous. What is its definition of a 'bullet?' If someone used a shotgun, and a
single pellet struck, would that be sufficient?"
Crystal Saint Claire:
"... When in doubt, use a revolver."Alexander Hauswald:
"One of us gonna challenge it to a duel. maybe?"
"An' when that gun don' work, use more gun."Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"...if someone duels it, they will most likely die..."Crystal Saint Claire:

"Depends. How quick's it on the draw?"Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"I think we MIGHT be able to kill it."Alexander Hauswald:
"Nobody said duel's gotta be fair."
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers smirks. "Ah like the way you think."
Bartender lifts a keg out from under the bar and rests it on his shoulder. He walks through the door into
the backroom with it.
"...So. What're we going to do now?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Drink?"Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"I... think we should search for Marshall Gallows..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"...Let's drink when we're done with this, Mathers."Alexander Hauswald:
"If I shoot it dead, you pay. If you shoot, I pay. Deal?"
"Deal."Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"...what if I shoot it?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"We both pay?"Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"We'll cross that bridge when we get there."Alexander Hauswald:
Distinctly audible, but muffled by the walls of the bar, are two explosions.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
(BRB)Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"...What in the hell...?"Alexander Hauswald:
They came from outside.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Crystal Saint Claire immediately checks her bag.
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"No, nothing in here."
Crystal Saint Claire heads outside to investigate.
"...We're going."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald pulls his revolver and exits stage left. Potentially pursued by bear.
Whitney, Callie, and Nephi, are unfortunately passed out drunk.Wonderful Cowboy Land:

Who got Whitney DrunkAlexander Hauswald:
Whitney's passed out drunk?Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire is concerned, now, about leaving her alone...
No!Crystal Saint Claire:
The two of you walk outside.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
I was completely unaware she was drinking this much!Crystal Saint Claire:
Callie should follow you out in a moment.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Now, where did those explosions come from?
Crystal Saint Claire looks around, but is mostly blind.
Alexander Hauswald scans the skyline for any obvious indicators- smoke, fire, people running and
screaming...
Crystal Saint Claire is probably pretty good at detecting lingering explosion aromas though

Crystal Saint Claire pojnts and takes off running as fast as her little legs will take her
Alexander Hauswald starts running!
Callie still lags behind a little ways, but Alex, Sacks, and Crystal make it to the site of
the explosion within a few minutes.

Both of you can see a pile of wood and paper scraps. Broken chairs, desks, and the
like.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
There are a few boarded up windows on this side of the building.
"...Sacks, go check it."Alexander Hauswald:
The boards appear loose, like the nails were rattled half out.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"....Rrrruff."Sacks:
Sacks proceeds to reluctantly look around.
There's an ammunition box blown out of a small slit in the building.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Fifty caliber round.
The slit looks to have been busted out with a pickaxe.
"...Looks like... Someone broke in to steal ammo?"Alexander Hauswald:
Sacks sniffs around for any trails or clues.
Sacks.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
You can smell iron in the air.
There's the tingling smell of gunpowder too.
"...Firefight, too. Someone shot their gun."Alexander Hauswald:

There's a Gatling gun poking out through the slit of the wall.
"... Uh."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald tries to see if there's any slits that aren't occupied by guns he can peer into from.
"What? What is it?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"...oh."
Crystal Saint Claire tries tugging at the gun
There's the one you're next to.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
But there's...something blocking it.
Alexander Hauswald holds his revolver at the read and pokes said thing
Crystal Saint Claire inspects Big Gun
It squishes a little bit.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Your revolver comes back red.
"...Someone's dead."Alexander Hauswald:
"Try to find me an entrance, kid."
Alexander Hauswald tries to push the gatling gun back in so he could look.
The gun is well maintained Crystal, but otherwise unremarkable.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
You push, but other than more squishiness, the blockage is not moving.
"...Yeah, go find an entrance."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald seeks more slits throughout the length of the wall, also seeking a way in.
Does it look like it's been used recently?Crystal Saint Claire:
Alexander Hauswald would go for man-sized and dog-sized holes.
Nope.Wonderful Cowboy Land:

It's hard to tell.
The uniform is soaked through with blood.
He's been torn in half.
Alexander Hauswald 's stoic facade breaks, for just a moment.
Ragged stripes of flesh still connect the two parts of him, but that's about it.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"...Holy..."Alexander Hauswald:
"...Kid? Good news, bad news."
"Good news, found an entrance."
"Bad news, don't come near it."
"Sacks, go look around."
"Yes, I'm scared to."
Sacks hesitantly walks in.
"...why not?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Is it trapped?"
"I don't want to answer that question."Alexander Hauswald:
Crystal Saint Claire goes to look for Hauswald to ask him while she can see him work on the trap
There are more corpses around this side Sacks.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
You can see the source of the blockage.
Something pinned a man to the wall with the butt of a Gatling gun.
His hands are resting on it.
"Maybe I can help! I am much smaller, so I would be less likely to trigger any weight-based
traps..."

It was probably that.

Alexander Hauswald looks around, maybe at the rectangles.
"So... whatever WAS killing them..."Crystal Saint Claire:

Does it look like he was killed by dynamite?
Or are there bullet holes in him, or big flesh rips
"...What the hell..?"Rockett Rimjob:
He is missing the lower half of his body.Wonderful Cowboy Land:

"What are you doing?"Crystal Saint Claire:
All of the boxes appear to be ammo for the Gatling.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Thirty shots to a box.
Fifty caliber.
All the grey boxes?Rockett Rimjob:
Yep.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
You can probably carry one with the Gatling.
I can count eight in here, there was one outside too.Rockett Rimjob:
I take it I can't stuff all of it in my backpack like the TFN loot system.
Nope.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Can I help her carry some?Alexander Hauswald:
You can carry the Gatling and the rest of what you got.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Yes.
"Need help?"Alexander Hauswald:
Alex can carry two boxes, since he's not also going to be carrying a Gatling Gun.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"Grab a couple of them boxes. Gun ain't worth much if it ain't got bullets."Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob grabs one (1) box.
Alexander Hauswald grabs two. Maybe straps one to Sacks, too.
Yes to the first.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Rockett Rimjob looks at the gatling gun.
Ha ha, no, to the second.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Rockett Rimjob cranks the crank and empties out whatever's still in the chambers.
Your dog is not that stronk.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Crystal Saint Claire is probably less strong than the dog
what do I roll?Rockett Rimjob:
Well, since you're not really shooting at anything.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
You don't have to roll.

"Please do not fire those again..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Rockett Rimjob starts walking, hefting her new weapon with a disconcerting, sinister joy.
Crystal Saint Claire is still poring over a blood-soaked journal.

All of you get to the clinic soon enough. You pick up Callie along the way there.
Seems she got distracted with arresting a couple hooligans desecrating a statue.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers gives a low whistle of appreciation. "Sweet Mary, Joseph, and Jesus, Rockett."
Rockett Rimjob kicks the door open.
Rockett Rimjob stomps inside

"Ah can see that."Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
Rockett Rimjob sets it down with a thunk.
"I wouldn't recommend sticking that one anywhere it doesn't belong."Doc Mitchell:
"Not medically safe and all."
"My favorite part about you, horse, is that you cannot operate a firearm, and are thusly
incapable of firing one at inopportune moments."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"Ah'll tell ya what else ain't medically safe."Rockett Rimjob:
"My next favorite thing is that you are a good listener."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Rockett, you wanna help me with this bookshelf?"Doc Mitchell:
'Them fedders up there at tha prison got torn a new one."Rockett Rimjob:
"You hear 'bout 'em?" she asks, reaching down to lift the shelf.
"WHAT?"Sackhead:
"Who got...WHAT?"
"What happened?"
"Dunno."Rockett Rimjob:
"Confederates got... slaughtered."Alexander Hauswald:
"That's why Ah needa talk ta Mitchell."Rockett Rimjob:

The shelf goes up with a little tugging.Sackhead:
"Could also use his wagon for a tic. They got some bodies an' gats that need haulin'."Rockett Rimjob:
Sackhead tries to walks a few paces over to Rockett. She starts coughing halfway there and doubles
back.
"You never put yourself in danger of an aneurism, scaring me half to death and almost
killing yourself to save someone who would have managed without you."

"I should go inside. Thank you for listening to me."Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire toddles inside.
"My condolences."Alexander Hauswald:

"One of theirs is here, right?"Crystal Saint Claire:
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers looks at Crystal
"A remnant of the confederates from that prison?"Crystal Saint Claire:
Sackhead recovers from her coughing spell.
"Yes."Sackhead:
"Yes...my name's Shiela."
Crystal Saint Claire waves the blood soaked journal with a stick of dynamite acting as abookmark.
"What...happened?"Sackhead:
"...sorry ta break tha news to ya."Rockett Rimjob:
"This is in code. Would you look at it?"Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire lays the book on the table.
Sackhead turns around, clenches her fist, and slams it against the stone slab operating table for a few
minutes.
"They left... what I sure hope isn't a sign."Alexander Hauswald:
"Also, does the word 'White' hold any specific significance to you, or to them? It was written
in blood on the last page by the man in the impressive hat."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"...at least I believe it was him. He was closest to the book."
Sackhead turns back around. Her hand is swollen, and bloody. She tore through her glove and into her
knuckles.

"I don't know."
"Understandable."Crystal Saint Claire:
Sackhead grabs the book and flips it open.
is the journal in Confederate code or something? If so, maybe the resident Ranger
could decipher it...
(From Crystal Saint Claire):
"This is...or...was...The Major's."Sackhead:
"It's...his code."
"Did he tell you how to solve it?"Alexander Hauswald:
"I know everything that's going to be in here already."Sackhead:
"Military code?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"He didn't keep a lot of secrets, from us."Sackhead:
"Look at the bookmarked page?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Then why'd he'd right it in code?"Alexander Hauswald:
Crystal Saint Claire flips it open to the page written in blood.
"..."Sackhead:
"Is this..."
"His?"
"In case Yankees such as ourselves happened to come into contact withthe ournal."Crystal Saint Claire:
"The blood, or the handwriting?"
"To keep in practice."Sackhead:
"Either way, i do not know."Crystal Saint Claire:
"And because he didn't want anyone other than us nosing around in his journal."Sackhead:
"He was the only one near the journal, and it was his journal, so... I would assume it was
his."

"I could care less about the contents, honestly. If you want to just tell us anything written in
there that is relevant, and keep the journal... I would not object."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"Congratulations."Sackhead:
Sackhead tucks the journal into an inside pocket of her coat.
"...Miss. Please."Alexander Hauswald:
"Hauswald, don't be a jackass."Rockett Rimjob:
"She can keep it."Crystal Saint Claire:
"If she don't wanna tell us, she don't have to. Not like it's gonna stop our searchin'."Rockett Rimjob:
Sackhead produces an especially ragged cough.

"Are you unwell?"
"Are they...all dead?"Sackhead:
"...poor woman's gotta heal. Don't need tha stress."Rockett Rimjob:
Crystal Saint Claire looks concerned.
"How many of them were there?"Alexander Hauswald:
"...How many of them were there?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"We counted six."Alexander Hauswald:
"We found... six... and a half."Crystal Saint Claire:
"They are deader than dead. An' there wasn't a breathin' soul in tha whole place."Rockett Rimjob:

on it dad, and my app is gonna take off”. But there is no app, is there. There’s no hope. Just loneliness."

Whitney wakes up from her night of cider intake with a slight headache and a note
next to her head.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Whitney G. Elieen lets out a great big yawn...and an equally mighty groan as she reaches forward and
takes the note into her hands. Her holy mug sitting right next to her. As full as ever.
On the note is scrawled, "Doc Mitchell's" One of your companions must have left it, or
the Bartender.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Whitney G. Elieen lets the note fall to the floor...
Whitney G. Elieen yawns again before pulling herself up off the bed. How late was it...? She was not used
to sleeping in so late. To say the very least.
Do the Whitney head to Mitchell's place?Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Yes. She would shamble her way towards the place.Whitney G. Elieen:
is it the next morning?(From Poage):
Nah, this would be later that same day.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Righto.
The way is easy enough Whitney. You do not meet too much trouble along the way. There seems to be a tension
in the air though. Not of something waiting to spring, more akin to the quiet after a gunshot. When you make it to
Mitchell's, you see Crystal outside talking to a horse. Inside are the others. They appear to be embroiled in a
discussion with the woman who was hurt before. Perhaps it would be best not to disturb them.
(Wait, I thought Crystal was inside...)Poage:
(She came outside to talk to the horse a bit more)Wonderful Cowboy Land:
(Because he's probably the smartest one here, apart from her and Sacks.)
(my web is down . I'm currently on phone)Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire is outside, curled up, mumbling something to the horse.
Whitney G. Elieen can not help but smile as she makes her approach
The horse knickers softly.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"Hello Crystal...I see you have made a friend."Whitney G. Elieen:
Crystal Saint Claire almost shoots Whitney, jumps a solid three feet back, and curls up like a turtle.
The horse is displeased.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Crystal Saint Claire is huddled behind the remains of the cart, peeking out and noticing who it is.

"he's back..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"he's back and he's killing people and he knows where we are i just know it an ah'm scared out've m'mind"
"..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Crystal Saint Claire trails off into panicked breaths.
Whitney G. Elieen 's expression turns from one of shock to concern and finally something a little
more...distant. Though that did not tighten her grip on the little one. Not in the slightest.
"Shhh...It is going to be okay..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Be calm Crystal...I am here. Nothing is going to hurt you..."
"...I won't go with him"Crystal Saint Claire:
"I will out a bullet in my head before I let him take me"
Crystal Saint Claire takes a deep breath in...
"...there will be no bullets in anyone's heads now...no. He is not here. Not now..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"...and by him you refer to...the judge?"
"...Inyanga's."Poage:

"He was gonna by the time Hauswald and I reached the place."
"And... and inside..."
"...there were bodies."
"Six... And a half."Crystal Saint Claire:
"...I can only imagine the cruelty you found..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Perhaps God intended for me to miss this. She has been merciful to me as of late..."
"The last man... He used dynamite."Crystal Saint Claire:
"the explosion brought us there."
"we found his journal, and on the last page was the word WHITE. Written in blood. Fresh, still coagulating."
"The lady inside has it. She survived him."
"...I do not trust her."
"The one I healed...?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Doctor Mitchell's patient. Wearing the curious mask."Crystal Saint Claire:

"What reason have you to not trust her?"
"...she survived."Poage:

"You suspect foul play in this?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"...he wiped out a fortified position manned by members of the Confederate military single-handed Lu."Poage:
Handedly*Crystal Saint Claire:
"...a thing capable of single-handedly decimating a small fort was unable to kill her? No."
"If he wanted her dead, she would be dead."
"Therefore he wanted her wounded badly enough that she would require a doctor's care, possibly Doctor
Mitchell's."
"Therefore he wanted her here."
"There fore I do not trust her here."
"...the fruit of paranoia and fear or of observation and truth? I might agree with you on that
point. Either an act of God had saved her, or her being alive is by some dark design."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"God will help us I know. But God also helps those who help themselves. They most of all."
"In light of this, what would you do, Crystal, to prepare for the possibility?"
"I don't know..."Crystal Saint Claire:

"And what makes you think this my Crystal?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"...he uses people."Crystal Saint Claire:
"women... Children..."
"people who cannot help themselves."
"That he does...It is within the dark realm of his mind that he can concoct these horrors..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"But we must focus on what is in front of us first. What we can know. Maybe the good Doctor has made some
observations..."
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Whitney G. Elieen reaches to the side of her pack and produces a mug wrapped tight in cloth.
Crystal Saint Claire holds tight onto Whitney
"For your nerves." She said as she unwraps the still full mug of cider.Whitney G. Elieen:
"Do not drink too much...make not my mistake."
Crystal Saint Claire takes a sip. If it's alcoholic cider, she does a spit-take.
it is indeed alcoholicWhitney G. Elieen:

Crystal Saint Claire returns the mug.
"It tastes odd."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Too much for your liking?"Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen says with a gentle smile as she brings it to her lips for a sip
Crystal Saint Claire nods.
Crystal Saint Claire surgically attaches herself to Whitney's leg using a Hemmlot-Ulman Graft... Or HUG...
Crystal Saint Claire hugs Whitney's leg.
"You are better for my nerves."Crystal Saint Claire:
Whitney G. Elieen could not help but smile as she wraps her mug back up. Placing a hand right at the
center of Crystal's back, pushing her that much closer into her tall leg and long, flowing green dress.
"And you, my dear, are a welcome sight to my weary eyes."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Like a thousand and one sips of this very mug"
Crystal Saint Claire makes a noise that sounds like a sigh, then takes a deep breath.
"...maybe you can help her... Just... Please. Do not cause yourself irreparable bodily harm."Crystal Saint Claire:
"I did it once before have I not?" She says softly. With a smile. "If more is needed I will be
happy to provide it."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"And this time, God willing, I won't almost lose my leg."
"..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire hugs tighter. She's gotten a little stronger, to the point where you can tell when she's
holding on.
"Crystal...what a grip you have? It seems our mornings together are producing fruit!"Whitney G. Elieen:
"I am slightly stronger now! I can do almost fifteen push-ups consistently."Crystal Saint Claire:
"That is excellent! I am so proud of you...~"Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen hugs a little tighter!
"Soon you will be as strong as me in no time at all!"Whitney G. Elieen:
"...well maybe after a few years." She says with a giggle.
"God and my hormone production willing..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Then you won't have to treat me like a Ming vase!"
(Good night all!)
"Perhaps not probable, but I... do not hold much, if anything, beneath..."
Crystal Saint Claire takes a deep breath.

Cassie, you recall a lot of things talking about various types of vampires, but there is
very little about what to do if you are bit.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
If the vampire wants you to be a vampire, they gotta drain you of blood and you have to be a virgin.

Must be some real easy information.
You recall from when you were studying with your mentor Alex. When two
practitioners touch each other there is sometimes a...feeling, that passes between them. The severity and type
depends on each individual's magic.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Hamilton must still have some lingering in him.

Doc Mitchell makes a cut around Hamilton's head at about the level of his eyebrows. Once he completes
that cut, he makes four more. Each of the four cuts starts at the outside of the circular cut and ends at the
top of Hamilton's head. Mitchell puts his scalpel away in his bag. He turns back to the corpse, places a
hand on the top of its head, and peels down the skin.

Hauswald, you can see that the sigil is not carved onto the skull, but burnt onto it. The
burning does not appear to have caused any trauma to the flesh, only to the bone, as there is no scar tissue from
a previous incision. The sigil was somehow burnt into the skull without damaging anything else, which should be
physically impossible.

Rockett makes her way to the outskirts of town in a horse drawn carriage with Dobray.
The interior of the carriage is more spacious than most, but feels as small as all the rest due to the pile of Russian
meat sitting across from her.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"Miss Natasha iz excite to see you."Dobray:
"Everything oiled down."
"Everything."
"'Cludin' her, Ah hope."Rockett Rimjob:
"Da."Dobray:
"Should be arrive in second or three."
"Perfect."Rockett Rimjob:
Dobray turns and knocks on the wall of the carriage between himself and the driver. He lets loose a string
of Russian syllables and waits a moment. He gets a short word in reply and smiles.
"We here?"Rockett Rimjob:
Dobray boots open the door of the carriage.
"Da."Dobray:
"Miz Natasha shud be vaiting for you."
"Next to beeg ship."
"Hard to mees."
A massive...thing descends from the sky with more grace than it seems it should

Dobray smiles at Natasha's words and bends down so she can kiss him on the head. He pulls her into a
short hug, and then reverts swiftly back to professionalism.
Natasha Minayeva gives him a firm pat on the back before pulling away. Grinning wildly. "Join us my

up the steps. "And I am glad you approve~"
"There is Dobray. The pilot. My four gunmen and my bomb technician. Myself included."
Dobray is reticent as Natasha talks about how she's going to have Rockett. There might even be a bit of
blush underneath his eight o clock shadow.
"Ah see. Skeleton crew? Or... are there a few more'n that on board tha airboat?"Rockett Rimjob:
"There is always more. But none that are with us tonight. I did not intend for you to fuck an

Excuse me. My net decided to fuck off.UrbanCritter:
Alex excuses himself from the company of his friends and treks to town alone. He
looks over the facade of the square for a particular type of shop. He has no concrete idea of what it looks like, only
a feeling. He soon spots a place that matches that feeling. A shop sign with no filligree, in muted colors and
flowing script that reads, "Gohvis Books."
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"...Seems like the right place. Wait here, Sacks."Alexander Hauswald:
"[Buy me a book, okay? I'm behind on my reading.]"Sacks:
"[I'll see if they stock Dickens."Alexander Hauswald:
"[Thanks, boss.]"Sacks:
Alexander Hauswald walks inside, looking around.
The door creaks a bit as you enter. Warm air envelops Hauswald with a gentle,
beguiling embrace. The smell of the musty pages comes next. It tickles the nose with the promise of knowledge,
old and refined, like wine. There is a small sitting area, and a desk beyond that, and the bookshelves, the many
bookshelves. There is a man at the desk, bent over a tome with delicate tools in his thin hands.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Alexander Hauswald ltakes silent steps as if to not interrupt. "... excuse me."
Gohvis does not look up from his work. He finishes applying something from a pot sitting next to his
elbow into the book and settling a page into place. Then, he raises his aquiline features to Alex.
"Will you be needing, assistance?"Gohvis:
"I think I will.Alexander Hauswald:
"Mmmm."Gohvis:
I'm looking for a... Specific book. The newer editions are butchered beyond relief."Alexander Hauswald:
Gohvis sets his tools down and covers the pot with his lid.
"I'm sure..."Gohvis:
Gohvis rises from his chair and dusts off the legs of his corduroy trousers.
Alexander Hauswald shrugs. "You probably heard people talk about it before. Hoyle's Book of Games?"
"Of course."Gohvis:
"Which edition, would you like?"
Gohvis clasps his hands behind himself and peers down at Alex through his half moon spectacles.
"The earlier the better. If I didn't know better I'd ask for first or second but those are
collector's items nowadays."
Alexander Hauswald:
"Mmmmm."Gohvis:
Gohvis strolls over to a shelf behind Alex and pulls a black hardback down.
Gohvis flips it open.
Gohvis shuts it back.
1/20/2018 Chat Log for Wonderful Cowboy Adventure Land
https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 690/791
Gohvis walks back over to Alex.
Alexander Hauswald lifts a brow at Gohvis.
"Sir?"Gohvis:
"Yes?"Alexander Hauswald:
"You appear, to be curious about something."Gohvis:
"The fact you stock it is one."Alexander Hauswald:
"At least, you USED to stock it."
"This place stocks many books."Gohvis:
"It is not altogether improbable for you to find the one you are looking for."
"That costs extra."
"Right. How expensive are we talking?"Alexander Hauswald:
"What do you have to pay with?"Gohvis:
"Money. Guns."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald fishes one of the unidentified coins.
"These, if they mean anything to you."Alexander Hauswald:
(back inna tick)Gohvis:
(poke?)UrbanCritter:
Back.Gohvis:
Gohvis stretches one hand forward and plucks the coin out of Alex's hand. He turns it over a few times,
squinting and widening his eyes to get a good look at it. His other hand drifts to his mouth and taps at his
cheek.
"Interesting, yes..."Gohvis:
"I could get a lot of books with this."
Gohvis looks Alex in the eyes.
"Do you have any more?"Gohvis:
"I need to ask. What ARE these coins?"UrbanCritter:
UrbanCritter reaches to his pocket and pulls the rest.
"Won these in a game."UrbanCritter:
(Need to reselect Alex)Gohvis:
(woop)Alexander Hauswald:
"This."Gohvis:
Gohvis twiddles the coin in his hand.

"Is a gold doubloon covered in sea muck."Gohvis:
"It appears to be Spanish."
"...Well now."Alexander Hauswald:
"Said friend is a lot richer than I thought."
"I think it's safe to say two of these are worth a book?"
"Yes, that one."Gohvis:
"I do have another one."
"... Another Book of Games?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Yes."Gohvis:
"And others besides."
"...Do tell, then. What else you got that can interest me?"Alexander Hauswald:
"What, are you interests?"Gohvis:

"Well, I study... Well, occult things, let's say."Alexander Hauswald:
"That is a broad range."Gohvis:
"What occult things?"
"I also have a friend that would be interested in a Charles Dickens book but that's not very
related."
Alexander Hauswald:
"Indeed, he was a good writer."Gohvis:
"Well, things more substantial than penny dreadfuls. Personally about what the Injuns call
'The Hunting Ground' magic rituals and such. Things about monsters, too."
Alexander Hauswald:
"May his spirit rest in peace."Gohvis:
"Mmmm..."
"Regrettably, I do not have much in stock of that."
"Their culture is...not easy to win trust with."
"And they pass along most of their information through oral tradition."
""So I heard. Do you have anything at all about magic? Maybe from the European side?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Indeed."Gohvis:
"What would you like to know about?"
"Mostly about the stuff that requires me to speak to demons, for example. The things Faust
was inspired by."
Alexander Hauswald:
Gohvis takes out a pad and pencil from a sweater pocket.
Gohvis scribbles down a few things.
Gohvis turns the pad to Hauswald.
1/20/2018 Chat Log for Wonderful Cowboy Adventure Land
https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 692/791
Alexander Hauswald examined it.
"Unabridged copy of Faust, Demonology for Beginners, and The Crossroads."Gohvis:
"I can also recommend a Dickens for your friend."
"These all look like a good start, sir. What can you recommend in that regard?"Alexander Hauswald:
Gohvis flips the pad closed, tucks it into the pocket if came from, and begins walking along the shelves.
He picks out four books and brings them back to his desk.
Gohvis slides the tome he was working on to the side and pulls a thick metal box out of a large desk
drawer.
Alexander Hauswald uses the opportunity to close his eyes and focus, trying to see if he can feel a whiff
of the arcane around here.
You can't smell the arcane, but you can feel it. A low hum at first that gets louder in
your mind the more you focus on it. You can almo-
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Gohvis snaps his fingers, bringing you back to reality.
"None of that."Gohvis:
Alexander Hauswald snaps back to reality.
"I beg your pardon?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Have you ever head, of privacy?"Gohvis:
*heard
"Heard about it. Didn't think you'd notice. Or know."Alexander Hauswald:
Gohvis throws a glare of utter contempt at Alex.
"Mister Hauswald."Gohvis:
"I live in a bookshop."
"I am selling you books that instruct how to cheat magic from the supernatural world."
"Not every storeowner in New York is a Huckster, Mr. Gohvis."Alexander Hauswald:
"Did it occur to you, that I might have read some of them."Gohvis:
"Hmm."
"Perhaps, be more considerate in the future."
"Or you will quickly run up a tab."
"Of course, sir."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald has the barest hint of a grin.
Gohvis turns up the intensity of his glare a notch. One thing hand stretches out and his fingers snap
again. Alex's shoes slide forward and stop right in front of Gohvis' desk.
"Seven."Gohvis:
"...Seven dubloons?"Alexander Hauswald:
1/20/2018 Chat Log for Wonderful Cowboy Adventure Land
https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 693/791
"Seven ears of corn."Gohvis:
"Of course seven doubloons."
"Can we settle on five?"Alexander Hauswald:
Gohvis slides three books off the pile.
"Yes."Gohvis:
"...Fair enough."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald rolls his eyes and slides seven dubloons over.
Gohvis sets the other books back, takes the coins from Alex, and slides the books over to him.
"A pleasure."Gohvis:
Alexander Hauswald examines the book, starting with the book of Games.
On the front is the title of the book. Underneath that, is a large four.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
All in silver lettering on jet black cover.
"...Fourth Edition, huh?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Yes."Gohvis:
"...Fairly recent. We're, what, fifth, sixth edition nowadays?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Yes."Gohvis:
I hear they're working on a seventh already."
"...Well, suppose this is the best you have? Every edition has someone edit out another
chunk of the important stuff."
Alexander Hauswald:
"I know."Gohvis:
"It is the best you are currently getting."
"...Hm.Alexander Hauswald:
Do tell me if you ever get an earlier one, then."
"I will endeavor to inform you."Gohvis:
"This'll do fine for the moment."Alexander Hauswald:
"Excellent."Gohvis:
Alexander Hauswald collects the books and nods at Gohvis.
"... Actually..."Alexander Hauswald:
Gohvis inclines his head a degree to Alex.
"I want to ask about something else. Less related to books."Alexander Hauswald:
"I"m looking for my brother. A bit taller than me, darker hair. Last time I saw him he was clean shaven."
"Forcall I know he was taken to the west against his will by a..."

Alexander Hauswald tries to remember who exactly took him. Something about a pale man?
Pale man, bullets don't do much to him, and appears to have a penchant for causing
trouble wherever he is seen. Including your former beat.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"Pale man. Trouble all around him, bullets didn't do much. You seen someone like that,
heard anything?"
Alexander Hauswald:
"I have heard certain rumors about that individual, or one that matches that description."Gohvis:
"Rumor though."
"Any bit helps."Alexander Hauswald:
"Unsubstantiated and difficult to verify."Gohvis:
"Several of them do have an interesting common tidbit though."
"Do tell, Mr. Gohvis."Alexander Hauswald:
"Well, since you've patronized my shop so thoroughly, I will."Gohvis:
"Relation to the 'Indian' tribes."
"Many of the stories involve people getting warning from those people."
"Either directly, or indirectly."
"...What a coincidence. I'm headed to Wyoming soon."Alexander Hauswald:
"Keep an ear and eye open."Gohvis:
"Information like that is valuable."
"I'd certainly want it."
"Will do, Mr. Gohvis. Thank you and have a good day."Alexander Hauswald:
"You as well, Mister Hauswald."Gohvis:
"Do come again."

handing it to Sacks.

Rockett Rimjob kicks open the doors to the saloon and saunters
Nephi "Longiron" Delano follows in behind
"Callie, Nephi, y'all wanna drink?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
You see the bartender at his post. The townsfolk you saw earlier are around a table
playing cards, save one that is drinking alone.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"Ah ain't gonna turn one down."Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"Anythin' specific?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Not really."Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"After you, Cassie."Rockett Rimjob:
"Howdy, pardner. Yew got real petey?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
peaty*
Bartender takes a mug off the counter and crouches down under the bar for a moment. A fizzling sound
burbles out from under the counter. The barman sets a fresh mug of dark ale down in front of Cassie a
second later.
Rockett Rimjob looks at the mug.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano sits at a table by himself.
"...pff."Rockett Rimjob:
"Ah think there's been a misunnerstandin'."
"...Ah remember yew sayin' tha's a scotch, sugercube."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"You get Scotch."Bartender:
"When you show me you can afford Scotch."
"Yeah. Cass here's lookin' ta get me some scotch."Rockett Rimjob:
"Believe it 'r not, she's takin' up after me. Did some tutorin' earlier. Turns out she ain't half bad."
"Made ten bucks off 'er first customer."
"..."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Mmmm."Bartender:
Rockett Rimjob just looks at Cass with a sly grin
Cassie-May O'Brien pulled out a ten dollar bill from her bra and gave the bartender a deadpan stare.
Rockett Rimjob starts -giggling-
Bartender pulls a dark bottle down and sets a short glass in front of Cassie.
Bartender takes the ten.
Bartender sets down a second bottle, much like the first.

"Tha's bettur. An' a milk in th' cleanest glass yew got ta th' beanpole boy sittin' alone at th'
table."
Cassie-May O'Brien:
Bartender nods.
"Put a cherry garnish on it, too."Rockett Rimjob:
Cassie-May O'Brien gave Rockett's ankle a light kick and leaned in.
Rockett Rimjob quirks a brow at Cass.
Cassie-May O'Brien whispered.
Rockett Rimjob nods once.
Cassie-May O'Brien pulled back and smirked.
"Ah'll just take a beer."Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:
"Yer gonna make us down these two bottles ourselves?"Rockett Rimjob:
"Come on, Cal."
Bartender pulls another glass out. This one taller and wider than the shot glass. He opens the icebox,
pours something white out of a bottle into it, and takes it over to Nephi.
"...Oh, they're making fun of me again, aren't they?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Bartender sets the glass down in front of him.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano sighs, not about to complain.
Rockett Rimjob looks over her shoulder and stares at Nephi with a... curious expression.
Cassie-May O'Brien ignored the shot glass and just took a swig from the bottle.
Rockett Rimjob waits until he takes a sip.
Bartender takes a bottle of maraschino cherries out of his apron.
"Dunno."Bartender:
Bartender sets one down on the rim of Nephi's milk.
"...Well, ah guess it ain't all bad."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Jesus traveled with the sinners, not the saints, after all."
"Died next to them too."Bartender:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks back at Rockett as he picks up the drink, holds it up, then takes a sip.
Bartender walks back behind the bar.
"Yep."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Bartender slides the ale over to Callie.
Rockett Rimjob subtly reaches in her dress and adjusts her bra as she sees Nephi take a sip. She was
almost nippin' in plain daylight.

Rockett Rimjob turns back to the bar.
"..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"..."
"...She couldn't have."
"Dollar and fifty cent ma'am."Bartender:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks back at it.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks back to rockett
"...fer milk an' a cherry?"Rockett Rimjob:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks back to the drink
Cassie-May O'Brien looked over at Nephi with a wide grin and raised her own whiskey bottle in a toast.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano mimicks Cassie's motion.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano does so quite reluctantly.
"Milk, cherry, and vodka."Bartender:
Cassie-May O'Brien sips her drink, maintaining eye contact.
"Ain't got no straight milk left."Bartender:
"Oh boy. That poor boy's in fer a surprise, ain't he."Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob digs out two dollars and gives it to the bartender.
Bartender takes the bills and tucks them into his apron.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano continues to lightly sip, quirking an eyebrow.
"Weird cows they got around here..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers stifles a giggle
"...Welp, now th' bluff's got real."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Rockett Rimjob snickers quietly to herself.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano continues to almost enjoy his "drink"
"Wit' how much yew drink, Rockett, yer own titmilk woulda be boozed up fer sure."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Ain't they supposed to have that Andrew fella in here?"Marbh Teine:
"Probly."Rockett Rimjob:
"...Somethin's real off bout this."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Probly tastes like tobacco, too, 'round this time'a year."Rockett Rimjob:

"..Dunnaw, Rockett. Ah woulda have ta try mahself."Cassie-May O'Brien:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano proceeds to eavesdrop.
"Wears a...thing like them Indians right?"Beaumont Clark:
Denard takes a long sip from his coffee stained mug.
Rockett Rimjob lightly elbows Cass.
"Yers'd probly give me tha jitters, all that coffee ya drink."Rockett Rimjob:
"Nah, supposed to be...more. Look like actual bird."Denard:
"Must be one of them fuckin' wonky Northerners."Marbh Teine:
"Watch it Teine, I came down here from Maine."Gnawly Garret:
"Mn?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Ah've seen you guzzle that shit."Rockett Rimjob:
"Put mah habits ta shame."
Rockett Rimjob opens her bottle and takes a sip.
"Careful."Bartender:
"Want to pace yourself with a drink like that."
"..."Rockett Rimjob:
"Yew know, sugercube. Coffee means Ah gotta sleep less."Cassie-May O'Brien:
(sorry, net hiccup)
'Ah could drink anyone in this bar unner tha table. Ah know mah own pace."Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob lifts the bottle to her lips and takes a couple indignant gulps.
"Can you now?"Bartender:
"Tha's fuckin' Rockett Rimjob. 'Course she can."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"I know Marbh over there is pure blood Irish."Bartender:
"Fucker pisses better whiskey than they have in most bars up North."
"Looks tha part."Rockett Rimjob:
"Think you can get him?"Bartender:
"If ya give 'em five shots ta catch up."Rockett Rimjob:
"Mmm."Bartender:
"HEY MARBH."
Marbh Teine slams his tankard against the table.

Rockett has not had five shots. She has had three and wants an edge.(From Rockett Rimjob):
"LADY OVER HERE SAYS SHE CAN OUTDRINK YER."Bartender:
"FUCK OFF."Marbh Teine:
"SHE'LL PONY UP FOR IT IF YOU WIN."Bartender:
Cassie-May O'Brien glugs another sip of her whiskey down.
Marbh Teine slides his chair back and waltzes over.
Marbh Teine throws his an arm over Rockett's shoulder.
"Ayyy lass."Marbh Teine:
"Yew got noice knockers."
"Ay think them, and you, is fulla hot ayr though."
"'Fraid not, beardboy. Ires got nothin' on me."Rockett Rimjob:
"I'm not draggin' him home."Beaumont Clark:
Bartender pulls two bottles down and pushes them toward Teine. He pulls another one down and pushes
it to Rockett.
"Five, Marbh."Bartender:
Rockett Rimjob takes her bottle.
"Aye, Aye, kayp yer panties pressed."Marbh Teine:
Marbh Teine takes one bottle, pops the top off, and swigs. His adam's apple bobs five times. The red
haired man sets the bottle down.
"Alright."Marbh Teine:
"Less go."
"You got five in ya?"Rockett Rimjob:
"Course I do."Marbh Teine:
"Mebbe a bit more."
"Figured you could use a bit o' help."
Rockett Rimjob rolls her eyes. "Ah ain't tha one that's gonna be needin' help after this..."
Rockett Rimjob looks at the Bartender.
"Yer tha ref here."Rockett Rimjob:
Bartender nods.
"Get started."Bartender:
"Shot each."
Vigor check for both.

Rockett Rimjob then proceeds to shove her face in Cass' bosom. Nephi could likely hear a very loud

Rockett Rimjob stops after a short moment.
Rockett Rimjob pulls back. She tries to flash Cass a grin, but it's drunken and disfigured. She them

Rockett, you feel warm inside. Warmer than you have in a while. It is a familiar sort of heat though.
Your mind is addled with booze and coffee. Hands grow jittery and restless. Toes curl and uncurl of their own will.
Eyes widen. Teeth go on edge. You're going to have to burn off some of this excess energy.

Cassie-May O'Brien untangled herself from the hug and pulled Rockett's covers away, so she could get to

Rockett Rimjob muffles a burp with her hand.
Cassie-May O'Brien tucks the covers over herself and Rockett, snuggled up to her.

Gotta throw a bunch of stuff off a map.
Alex has been up tonight trying to drown the memory of his brother and the chalk
skinned man who took him in a bottle of whiskey. He has made it through one and is starting in on a second when
the Bartender leans in and taps the table in front of the former lawman.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"We got talking to do."Bartender:
UrbanCritter looks up from his glass, lifting a brow.
*Alexander Hauswald:
"What about?"
1/20/2018 Chat Log for Wonderful Cowboy Adventure Land
https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 725/791
Alexander Hauswald squints, trying to see if this is the Bartender or Horn's poker buddy he's talking to.
"Favors owed."Bartender:
Bartender pulls a cloth out of his apron. It smells like beer. He holds it out to Alex.
"...Ah."Alexander Hauswald:
"Clean up a little, you're a mess."Bartender:
Alexander Hauswald wipes his face, trying to go from 'drunk' to 'capable'.
As Alex wipes the cloth across his face, he senses a change in the atmosphere of the
room.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"I'm saying what I already said. I'll head to Wyoming when I'm done here-"Alexander Hauswald:
"Yeah, yeah."Wonderful Cowboy Land:
*Horn:
Horn lays both hands flat on the bartop and looks over Alex with his sunken sockets.
"I'm here to give you some detail."Horn:
"What, being cryptic got tiring?"Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald sets his glass aside.
"No, there have been developments."Horn:
"I need to keep you abreast."
"Since we're business partners, and you will be representing me."
"Fair enough. Go ahead."Alexander Hauswald:
Sacks is wondering where his boss is.
Sacks, you are outside. You are tied to a post. You have a bone. The bone is good.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
You also have your copy of Barnaby Rudge.
[This is fine.]Sacks:
"Right, you'll be going to Wyoming and will meet up with a contact of mine in the forest around the city of
Moose."
Horn:
"... Eloquently named. What's his name?"Alexander Hauswald:
"He's old, he's Indian, and he could tear your throat out at a moment's notice."Horn:
"His name is Lyoop."
"Be polite."
"...Right. an old Indian called Lyoop. What's the occasion?"Alexander Hauswald:
"You need him to find a man."Horn:
"A man with a red right hand."

"... I'm going to need a little more detail, Horn."Alexander Hauswald:
"That's all the detail I can give you at the moment, other then what you need to do when you find my man."Horn:
"What do I need to do, then?"Alexander Hauswald:
"You need..."Horn:
Horn leans a little further over the counter of the bar, pushing a few mugs out of the way.
"To shake his red, right hand."Horn:
"Do not let anything stop you from doing this."
"...Shake his hand and bring him to Lyoop."Alexander Hauswald:
"Yes."Horn:
"Lyoop will have more for you when you get to him."
"He has to abide by fewer, restrictions."
"Strange rituals you're concocting."Alexander Hauswald:
"Still. I do this and we're even. Correct?"
"You do this, and all debts are paid."Horn:
"Mine to you."
"And yours to me."
"...Except one."Alexander Hauswald:
"Thomas."
"I know."Horn:
"This is the way to him."
"m.."Alexander Hauswald:
Horn takes his hands off the top of the bar and steps back. He holds both of them out to his side open
palmed.
"What?"Horn:
"Don't you trust me?"
Alexander Hauswald 's grip around the glass tightened.
"I'm worried, Horn.Alexander Hauswald:
"I know you hold your deals."
"It doesn't mean I'm any less worried."
"Good."Horn:
"That means you're not an idiot."
"But I want you to know something."Alexander Hauswald:
"If I end up being swindled. If I find my brother with a bullet in his head..."
Alexander Hauswald takes a long sip from his glass.

"Not even hell would keep me from getting justice."Alexander Hauswald:
"Good boast."Horn:
"If you haven't got anything else to intimidate me with, I'll be going."
"I've got other business needs seeing to."
"Much more pleasurable business."
"I believe that'll be all, yes."Alexander Hauswald:
"Goodbye, Horn."
"Bye Hauswald, enjoy your drink."Horn:
Alexander Hauswald looks at him coldly, and closes his eyes, rubbing his temples.
Horn takes a bottle of whiskey out from under the bar and pushes it over to Alex.
Alexander Hauswald examines it when he opens his eyes.
Horn holds out his hand.
*Bartender:
(Internal screaming)
Alexander Hauswald looks at it suspiciously. Before shaking.
"..."Bartender:
"I want my rag back."
"What- oh. Sorry. Dozed off."Alexander Hauswald:
"No problem."Bartender:
"Happens all the time."
Alexander Hauswald hands him his rag back, trying to pretend he didn't just shake the man's hand.
Bartender takes the stained piece of cloth and tucks it back into his apron.
"So. You said something or was it just the booze playing with my mind?"Alexander Hauswald:
"Just telling you to make sure you don't out drink your own wallet."Bartender:
"Oh. I think I'll be fine."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald idly examines the bottle Horn pulled out, before setting his glass.
"...I think I'll be done after this glass."Alexander Hauswald:
"Alright."Bartender:
"Tab is five dollars."
"((Horn's bottle is just whiskey, then?))Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald slides a fiver on the counter, finishing his glass.
"Have a good evening, sir."Alexander Hauswald:

We can't have more than ten chips at a time, according to the manual
It has been an interesting time, but as of today it is time to do as sages past have said
time after time, get the hell out of Dodge. Normally, for the distance you folks need to travel, it would take a train
ride and a full set of horses. It is a good thing you are travelling with Rockett and her magical, mystical cooter. She
banged her way into getting passage for the lot of you on an expensive airship captained by one of the railroad
baronesses. You think it is a Miss Natasha, but everyone on the airship besides you guys speaks with a gratuitous
Russian accent that it renders their speech near incomprehensible. The important part is that the ship gets you
folks where you're going. It touches down just outside of Moose, Wyoming. Whitney, Crystal, the tiny bandit boy,
Callie, and Rockett stay behind to pray, fawn over Whitney, raid the pantry, search the town's bounty board, and
fuck the railroad baroness, respectively. The rest of you head out into the forest as Alex tries to explain what little
he knows about the current mission from hell.

It says on the outside that it is a whiskey produced by the Doge Distillery Est. 1832.

"Sacks says thanks too."
"Besides. I'm sure you both would do the same fer me if it were my brother in trouble."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Cheer up, fellas!"
"We're on an adventure!"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano throws both hands into the air, laughs, and takes a step towards Lyoop.
"You're on an adventure. I'm paying a debt."Alexander Hauswald:
"Doesn't mean you can't have a good time."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Ma always used to say there was no such thing as adventure."
"We just got problems, conundrums, fightin, pain, and sex."
"It's when we survive and tell it to someone else that it becomes an adventure, right?"
"...Sex? Ain'cha mormon?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Cassie."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"We have lots of sex."
"Just between couples."

Rockett, you just got done having a hell of a time with Natasha and Dobray and...probably some
other people. You can't remember right now. Point is, Alex and Cassie and Nephi left to go and do something. You
aren't missin' out on it, and you especially ain't missin' out on teasing Nephi.

"...Y'all okay, Rockett?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Cassie-May O'Brien steps off the log to give the two space to cross
"Finding you was hard."Crystal Saint Claire:
"...Sorry to hear."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald pauses. Something dawns on him.
"Crystal."Alexander Hauswald:
"You said a while ago you were interested in learning about huckstering?"
"...Ah can drink whiskey 'til tha sun comes up. Rum treats me well, an' even tequila of all things

Nephi does if you don't.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Lyoop digs around in his leather shirt for a moment before pulling a large, hand rolled cigarette out of a

Nephi "Longiron" Delano fills his canteen with water from the stream while he's here.
"Honey the only thing growin' in yer case is a pedo's tentpitcher."Rockett Rimjob:
"Help with hangover."Lyoop:
Alexander Hauswald heads to the river and fills his canteen.
Alexander Hauswald pulls his gun out and closes his eyes.

Lyoop takes a few steps towards the edge of the clearing.
Crystal Saint Claire follows close behind.
Alexander Hauswald follows, trying to talk to Crystal.
Cassie-May O'Brien follows, hand near her revolver
"...So as I was saying."Alexander Hauswald:
"Follow me, don't try to leave path I'm walking."Lyoop:
Crystal Saint Claire tries to stay as close as is safe, because if she gets to far away she might loose sight
of Lyoop.
"Don't take anything."Lyoop:
"Yes sir."Crystal Saint Claire:

"Hoyle hid every spell he could find inside the book- it's all in complex codes and diagrams.
Cassie-May O'Brien listens in to the two
"Granted, every edition a bit is lost because of bad copying and bad editors, but even in
the fourth edition there's a good chunk left."
Alexander Hauswald:
"So between me and the book, I think I can teach you some Hexslinging."
"I would be more comfortable starting with theory, if that is okay..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Of course. First we just have to see if you can crack the code."Alexander Hauswald:
"Code-crackin', yew say?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"You're a smart girl but Huckstering isn't an exact science-"Alexander Hauswald:
"Yes, Cassie."
"I just said. Hoyle hid his lessons and spells in the book."
Lyoop takes all of you on a winding path through the woods. As you get further in, it
feels like you should cross the path you were walking before, but the trees are perpetually unfamiliar. At some
point, moss covered stones start appearing underfoot. It is hard to tell when they start. It is possible to tell that the
stones are getting less moss covered as the path winds on. The woods get darker, and darker. Soon, it is difficult
to see the bright colors in Lyoop's clothes. Then, the Indian pushes through a dense patch of brush and emerges
into sunlight. He motions for the rest of you to follow.

Crystal Saint Claire follows, shielding her eyes from the sudden light.

Lyoop stands back from the rest of the group and does not set foot on the path.
"Whut's this place?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Old lumber town."Lyoop:
"Forgot by most people."
"Only a few remember it."
"...It's so green."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Is there somewhere to sleep? I am... suddenly exhausted..."Crystal Saint Claire:

Alexander Hauswald just smiles gently.
Crystal Saint Claire exhales.
"Big dining hall."Lyoop:
"Sure they can accommodate in there."
There is a statue sitting in a pool in the middle of the town square.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
It looks ancient.
Moss is growing over the base of it.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads over to look at it.
Crystal Saint Claire makes a note to look at it when she's not exhausted.

"Were those your friends out there?"

"Five..?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Five."
I'll make up stats in a bit. Know that it is a decent upgrade from a regular double barrel.(To Scotty):

The rifles look to be well made, even if they are all the same. A reliable looking lever action with no
apparent model number or maker's mark.

"Ah, that one."Gun Runner:
"Yes, that would be..."
"Fifty."
Crystal Saint Claire holds her bag tight to her chest.
Rockett Rimjob looks a little confused. "Fifty? Fer somethin' that fell off tha back of a wagon?"
Alexander Hauswald reaches into his pack and pulls out two colt navies.
"What'll you give me for these?Alexander Hauswald:
Hod stays silent as Crystal speaks. The lips of the woman beside him flatten against her face for a
moment. Her eyes show a flash of pain. The man touches one hand with the other, absently.
"No one like that here."Hod:
"For those?"Gun Runner:
"Eh..."
"Five."
"Okay... Sorry to trouble you."Crystal Saint Claire:
"I will find somewhere to sleep. Thank you for having me under your roof."
"And Miss, I did not say that one fell off the back of a wagon."Gun Runner:
"That one."
"She is my prize."

Crystal Saint Claire is not particularly perceptive.
"Where'd you get 'er?"Rockett Rimjob:
"Five dollars for both?"Alexander Hauswald:

"...I don't suppose you have a a two-action .44 revolver?"Alexander Hauswald:
Yes. The red headed woman takes Crystal to the side and gives her something to drink before going
to find a bedroll for her.
(To Poage):
Ten gauge Rockett.Gun Runner:
"I might, I might."
Crystal accepts the drink, and drinks it.(From Crystal Saint Claire):
"Look over on the other table."Gun Runner:
I gotta head out, all. I'm excited to see where we go!Crystal Saint Claire:
The drink is sweet, and warm. It tastes like honey.(To Poage):
Alexander Hauswald nods and heads over to examine the table.
Seeya, Pogger!Alexander Hauswald:
Adios!Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob rests the gun on her shoulder, crook of the action on her collar bone. Then, she digs out
her wallet.
"Fifty, ya said?"Rockett Rimjob:
Sacks sniffs the things. Sacks sniffs all the things.

"...Hmm..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Something doesn't add up..."
"Whuzzin 'ere?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Nothin' but me."General Store Owner:
"Dunno. Looked like more shops."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Sacks tries to sniff all the old.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has his hands in the pocket of his duster coat.
General Store Owner has his legs propped up on the counter as he reads through a book.
"Ah got an ol' scattergun, too. How much would you fork over for it?" she asks, holding out a $50
bill to the man.
Rockett Rimjob:
"Not in bad shape. Ain't in great shape, but... y'know, function over fashion."
Alex, there are three guns and a pile of ammo on the table.Gun Runner:
"How long's this place been here, mister?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
((...Remind me what does C&B means, ammowise?))Sacks:
Cap and Ball.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Means reloading takes way longer.
Alexander Hauswald picks them up, examining them gently.
You get one round per two or three actions instead of one round per action.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Cassie-May O'Brien eyeballs through the shelves in search o anything that would catch her eye.
The black one looks like it might be a double action. One next to it is a little older, and the one on
the far end looks to be a single action. Calibers seem to be .44, .44, and .32.
Gun Runner:
"I'd have to see the gun senorita."
"See anything you like, Cassie?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Probably about seven bucks for a shotty."Gun Runner:
Alexander Hauswald lifts the first two, examining them closely.
Rockett Rimjob yoinks it out of her pack, holding it by the barrel.
Rockett Rimjob holds the handle out.
There's several things here Cassie, but you know what you're really looking for. They got
it, halfway across the third shelf from the top. Coffee grounds.
General Store Owner:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano just watches Cassie go about her shopping
Cassie-May O'Brien licked her lips and examined those closer
Nephi "Longiron" Delano had never gone shopping with Cassie before

Gun Runner grabs the gun by the handle. He examines the outside for a minute before cracking open the
breach, popping out the shells, and eyeballing the inside. He tests out the catch a few more times, then
leaves it closed.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is starting to get more than a little unnerved.
"Is good, for you, I will make it eight dollars."Gun Runner:
Gun Runner takes Rockett's fifty and her gun. He hands back a five dollar greenback and four one dollar
coins.
Rockett Rimjob takes the money. Then, she holds out one coin back to him.
The coffee comes in only one size, the big tin. Picking it up and smelling in between the
join of the lid gives you a strong odor that tingles somewhere at the base of your brain. This is the good stuff.
General Store Owner:
Gun Runner holds his hands up in protest.
"Senorita."Gun Runner:
"...Uuuuunnnnh.."Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Please."Gun Runner:
"...What's that coffee?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Five an' three makes eight. You gave me four coins."Rockett Rimjob:
Rockett Rimjob holds it out.
Alex, the two you're holding up to look at are quite different. The barrel of the lighter colored tapers
slim, the black one's barrel is larger, and a little stubbier. The action on the black one is harder to work, and the
entire gun feels heavy in your hand. The lighter colored gun's action is single, but it works like a dream. It is a
balanced weight in your hand, not too much, not too little.
Gun Runner:
"Ah, you see."
Gun Runner takes the coin back.
"Maybe I was trying to get in on your good side, hey?"Gun Runner:
"..."Alexander Hauswald:
Alexander Hauswald sets the heavy one down, smiling.
"Good coffee."General Store Owner:
"How much for this little beauty?"Alexander Hauswald:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads inside here, and waves hello
"Don't go snortin' it up now."General Store Owner:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano takes a look around
Rockett Rimjob chuckles a little, at that. "Hey, now. Ah work fer ev'ry dollar Ah earn," she says simply.
"Pleasure doin' business, though."
"That much Ah can smell... Where'd yew git it from?"Cassie-May O'Brien:

GM? Looking for anything out of the ordinary.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Rockett Rimjob packs the shotgun into the case, then takes it with her.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano seems increasingly... Distressed, the more time passes.
"Is it someone new?"Hod:
"Looking for something dear?"Sigyn:
"Maybe. Dunno."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Ain't we all?"
Nephi, you see a lot of old machetes and axes and shields lying around. No, not
machetes, what are they called...
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Like, swords?Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
There's also the smell of something like honey and roasting chicken.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Like, real biblical stuff?Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
That's it.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has only ever seen swords in the art the church puts out every so often.
"...Are you two blacksmiths?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Good shooting cactus flower."Gun Runner:
Cassie-May O'Brien stares at the coffee tin for a long moment, then hastily puts it back on the shelf
"Because that looks like a forge, over there."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"For that one beard man..."Gun Runner:
Rockett Rimjob gives Sacks scratches.
"What is this place?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Twenty."Gun Runner:
"A good place that people forgot about."General Store Owner:
"...Hrm."Alexander Hauswald:
"Forgot how long ago, eh?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
"Never met a blacksmith that still makes swords, though."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Alexander Hauswald looks at the gun.
"Do you have somewhere I can test it?"Alexander Hauswald:
"That is not a forge."Hod:
"That is where we roast the chickens."
"Sometimes goat."

"...How long are yew here?"
"Didn't think you do. Would trading my old Colt Army help the price any?"Alexander Hauswald:

"Ain't been around too long myself."
"Least, I don't recall being around too long."

imagining.

"...On th' way where, exactly? Whut's the name of this place?"Cassie-May O'Brien:
Valdyrbinda is curled up next to the man with ragged attire. The dog is covered in what looks to be
brands. Chain like brands. The fur on it is black as pitch.
"...Nice dog."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is increasingly unsettled.
"You can pet him if you want."Sigyn:
"I've only known him to bite Tyr."
"...Sure."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano gently pets the dog a few times after letting him smell his hand.

Crystal is literally in there napping on a bed roll.Wonderful Cowboy Land:

Cassie-May O'Brien takes the canteen and takes a few gulps, sloshing then around in her mouth to clean

Rockett Rimjob gestures to the table.
Cassie-May O'Brien just leans on the wall, pulling her hat deeper over her eyes.
"Something we brought over from the old country."Sigyn:
"You always have to keep something from home with you."
"You from Norway?"Rockett Rimjob:
"We came to America from there, yes."Sigyn:
Hod bends down to scratch behind the dog's ears.
Rockett Rimjob glances at the dog, but doesn't stare for long. "Explains a few things. Ah was worried y'all
were Swedes fer a second," she teases.
Hod chuckles for a moment as he lavishes affection on the dog.
"No, not quite."Hod:
"We came from our home to America seeking a new world."
"We found it."
"And it has lost us."
Cassie-May O'Brien looks up
"Whut were yer names again?"Cassie-May O'Brien:

All of you get situated in your places and turn in for the night. Most in the feasting hall,
others by the fountain. At some point, Sigyn and Hod leave. They do not close the door of the hall. There is no
door to close. Night falls soon, and each of you dreams deep of strange places. Some dream of a cave with three
pillars. Some dream of the feeling of mistletoe. Some dream of a wolf swallowing the moon and the sun.

To.
Whitney?
yesYuppie b.:
Whitney, you've been ahem "praying" in your bedroom since Crystal took off in search
of the others with Rockett. When you come out, you realize it is rather early in the next day. You exit the town and
take a look at the forest for, well, no reason at all. Certainly nothing to do with anything behind the scenes. As you
walk from the town of Moose into the lush forest around it, you come upon a clearing. A brook burbles, leaves
rustle, and there is another sound in the midst of the water that you can't quite pick out.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
You can move and see and junk right?(To Yuppie b.):
yes(From Yuppie b.):
Whitney G. Elieen felt groggy...among other things. Best not to think about those other things just yet. No
what she needed to do was to walk. The clearing looked as good as any.
The noise though was curious...Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen clunked her way forward, towards the babbling brook
Lyoop sits on a boulder on the other side of the brook. He is dressed in old, sun tanned leather, furs, and
feathers. A small pile of stones sits next to him. He watches Whitney as she approaches, picks a stone up,
and skips it across the brook. It comes to rest on top of Whitney's left shoe.
Whitney G. Elieen looks down at the stone that was thrown towards her. Bending downward to pick it up.
Grasping it tight in her hands, she smiles and waves her free one at the native0

"You."Lyoop:
"Got look about."
"With the others?"
"The others...yes." She says, noticing his broken English. Perhaps this would be a good time
to brush up on her native. She could not speak in tongues, at least not yet, but she did have a gift for them.
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Yes I am with them."
Lyoop gets up with a slow, fluid grace. He steps off the rock and lands on the ground in a crouch. The
sound, if there is any, does not reach Whitney. The leathery skinned man jerks his head behind him.
"Come."Lyoop:
"Show you the way."
Whitney G. Elieen nods her head as the giantess makes her way out towards the log...

Whitney, you get halfway across the log with not problems. It is then that your weight occurs to the piece
of wood. The log snaps in two and dumps you into the stream of water. It is cold. Your fingers go numb before you
can push yourself up and out of the water. You're pretty sure your nipples are about to shear through your dress
as you crawl up the bank.
Lyoop:
"A..aaah!!"Whitney G. Elieen:
Lyoop walks over and holds a hand out to Whitney as she attempts to leave the brook.
Whitney G. Elieen her massive weight snaps the very log in two! Sending the poor woman falling into the
cold water! By the time she is out of there, she is soaking and miserable...
Whitney G. Elieen reaches her hand out...

"Can't leave you in cold, wet clothes."Lyoop:
"Make a detour for you, before we go to where your friends went."
Lyoop pats Whitney's sopping wet shoulder.
Gettin' Whitney to were you guys are at, give me a tick.(To Poage):

"Yes...yes thank you..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen said, holding her shoulders in her own hands.
"M..much appreciated..."Whitney G. Elieen:
(just a tick)Lyoop:
Lyoop walks towards the dense forest. Once he gets to the edge of it, he turns and looks at Whitney.
"You comin'?"Lyoop:
should there be music playing?(From Poage):
I can't hear anything(From Poage):
Whitney G. Elieen follows right along, making full use of her long stride
"R..right behind you..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Lyoop walks through the woods, following a winding path that seems to turn in on itself several times.
There is no familiar terrain though, every tree looks different than the last. Lyoop takes a hard right after
what feels like hours of walking and emerges into the light. He keeps the branches and brambles parted
for Whitney to pass through.
Hot, muggy air slaps you in the face Whitney. The cold begins to leave you as you
emerge into a place with no greenery, the only break in the dirt and rocks is a blue steaming spring.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"Here."Lyoop:
"Throw clothes onto rock to dry."
"Warm in spring."
"I smoke and wait."
Whitney G. Elieen feels herself led along the long, confusing path. Distracted by the alien terrain as she
contends with her discomfort. Eventually though, after a time, they come across a site most welcome...a
smile tugging at her lips.

"God bless. Thank you..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Lyoop nods, then walks over behind the rocks as he takes a small tin out of a pocket of his leather shirt.
Whitney G. Elieen makes sure he is well outside the limits of her sight before she begins to undress...
Whitney G. Elieen folds her clothing neatly on a pile, leaving her things alongside it before walking into
the warm waters
A small plume of smoke emerges from behind the rocks. It is difficult to see the gray of
the tobacco smoke against the white steam coming from the spring.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
The water is hot, but nor uncomfortably so. It teases the tension out of your body and leaves only a warm
fuzziness behind. It would be easy to spend hours, days, weeks here.
Large as she was, she found herself sinking as low as she could go in the warm, comfortable
waters of the spring...how long had it been since she found such respite? Her body relaxed. Her eyes closed. For
once she opted to simply enjoy the moment. A reminder that not all in this world was corrupt and horrific...
Whitney G. Elieen:
(Can ze spectators see now?)Wonderful Cowboy Land:
(Ye)Crystal Saint Claire:
(Yes)Nevermore:
Laying back in the spring and floating amidst the soft current of water is relaxing.
Worries, stress, and memory seems to drift away with the water. Losing yourself in it is so pleasant. It would be so
easy to...
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"Hey."Lyoop:
"HEY."
"You awake over there?"
"..y.yes!" She blurts out suddenly. Followed by a great big yawn as she straightens herself
out. Stretching her arms out above her body.
Whitney G. Elieen:
"I am now at least..."
"Need to go soon."Lyoop:
"Best not to fall asleep here."
"Lose time."
Whitney G. Elieen says in a relaxed tone
"You are right...yes. One moment..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen gets herself up
Whitney G. Elieen goes over to her clothes pile
"...I am sorry to disturb you but my clothing is still wet..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"I would ask you if you had another dress but..."
Whitney G. Elieen frowns
"No, should be fine. Warm up on the way."Lyoop:
1/20/2018 Chat Log for Wonderful Cowboy Adventure Land
https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 776/791
"Right..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen slowly places the considerably less pleasant clothes back onto her body. Piece after
piece until she was fully clothed and suddenly much more eager to go.
Whitney G. Elieen sighs
"Thank you very much."Whitney G. Elieen:
Lyoop steps out from behind the rock. There are several hand rolled cigarette buts lying on the ground,
and plenty of ashes. How long were you in there?
"I appreciate it very much..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Welcome."Lyoop:
"And I am not very sure."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Maybe too long"
"I lost track of time..."
Lyoop looks at you with an odd expression for a moment. Then he turns and walks back into the forest,
motioning for Whitney to follow. Why should she go though? Her clothes are still wet, best to stay at the
hotsprings. The old Indian is a fool to leave.
"...I am sorry. I do not mean to impose but...do you think I can stay for a little bit longer? My
clothes are still very uncomfortable...I fear I will catch my death if I go now."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"They will dry up soon I am sure."
Lyoop walks back into the clearing and grabs Whitney by the arm. His face is flat and serious.
"Leave, now."Lyoop:
"Is..is something wrong?" She says as she is grabbed by the arm.Whitney G. Elieen:
"Please be careful..."
"Been here too long."Lyoop:
"Need to leave."
"Not a place meant to stay."
"It won't be forever! Perhaps you could even send some of my friends here to get me? I mean
I don't want to impose on you if you have business...and I know a few of the others would enjoy a soak."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"The poor things must be so tired."
Lyoop looks at Whitney for a long few seconds. Then he physically drags her back into the forest with
him. Whitney can feel something poking into her arm as he does.
"O..ow!"Whitney G. Elieen:
Do you resist Whitney?Lyoop:
Whitney G. Elieen drags her arm back as she follows along
she does inspect her arm after thatWhitney G. Elieen:

https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/chatarchive/2608552 777/791
Lyoop lets of her once they are both back into the forest. The opening in the brush where the Spring was
is nowhere to be seen. It is too dark to see, but running your fingers over your arm tells you that your
shirt is torn in five places. You can feel something warm in those spots.
"Time to go."Lyoop:
"Friends waiting."
Is Lyoop a werewolf? That's dope as hell(From Crystal Saint Claire):
"..."Whitney G. Elieen:
He might be.(To Poage):
Or he might be something else.(To Poage):
Whitney G. Elieen looks at her arms more closely. Feeling at the warm spots of her now torn up shirt. Was
that from falling into the brook, or...
"Why are you so eager to go? What is it that you are afraid of...?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Not good to stay here."Lyoop:
"At the spring."
"Or here."
"In between."
"Why? What is wrong?"Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen asks as she runs her hands down her arm
"What was that poking into my arm?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Must have been my fingernails."Lyoop:
"Get long."
"Living out in wild."
Lyoop starts walking further into the forest again. He checks back every few steps to make sure Whitney
is there.
Whitney G. Elieen follows along close behind him. Uncertain of what is going on or even the intentions of
this stranger...this was in God's hands now. Surely she would deliver her through whatever danger this
place posed.
"Right..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Lyoop continues through the forest with Whitney behind him. He moves swift through the foliage. He
brushes his right hand against his shirt a few times. Small stones begin to appear underfoot. Is he,
brushing his lips with his right hand? The stones develop into something resembling a path, they are
covered in moss. Lyoop steps through the brush into the light again. He holds the hole open for Whitney.
Whitney, you emerge into a green place. There are houses in the distance, and a
fountain with a statue standing in it.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is snoozing lightly next to the fountain
Nephi, you have been next to the fountain all night. You ate some of your rations and
drank from the water.

Crystal, you are waking up from a nap to discover more people in the feasting hall.
Crystal Saint Claire is asleep, snuggled up in a blanket on a haybale. She only needed one hay bale to
sleep on.
It is a bedroll and a pillow.Wonderful Cowboy Land:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano hasn't moved for hours.
"mrrh... G'mornin'..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has his rifle in as tight of a grip as his dozing self can manage
Crystal Saint Claire blearily wipes sleep from her eyes.

"Morning little one."Sigyn:
"Your friends are still asleep, try not to wake them."
"Oh! Good morning Miss Sigyn..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"I asked the others to be quiet as they could."Sigyn:
Crystal Saint Claire whispers to her.
"I will try to avoid waking them."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Do you know where I could find something to eat?"
"...thank you very much." She says, looking at the sleepy little town with a curious raise of her
brow. Turning to him with a smile and a bow of her head.
Whitney G. Elieen:
"God bless you for your hospitality and your guidance."
"Of course, we've got the meat for today spitted and roasting."Sigyn:
"I'll carve you some."
"Thank you..."Crystal Saint Claire:
Lyoop bows to Whitney. then walks back into the forest.
"Be waiting for when you want to come back."Lyoop:
"Be safe."
Crystal Saint Claire walks over to the roasting boar.
Crystal Saint Claire sleepily stretches, yawning a squeaky yawn, and turns to see if the sun is up yet.
Sigyn picks up the sword laying next to the fire pit and slices off a leg for Crystal.
Whitney G. Elieen steps forward, step after heavy step...
"Hod, mead and a plate?"Sigyn:
"That is a lot of meat... I am unsure I will finish it all."Crystal Saint Claire:
"...Nephi?"Whitney G. Elieen:

Hod wordlessly takes a mug of mead from under the flowing spigot and holds out a plate to Sigyn. The
woman slaps the leg onto, takes the plate and the mead, then gives it to Crystal.
"Here."Sigyn:
"Thank you. May I eat outside?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"You may eat wherever you wish."Sigyn:
"It is a beautiful morning."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Only, bring back the dishes..."Sigyn:
"Yes ma'am!"Crystal Saint Claire:
Sigyn peters off as Crystal runs outside.
Crystal Saint Claire peeks back through the door. "To you, or to Mr. Hod? Where do the dishes go?"
"I apologize, I ran off..."Crystal Saint Claire:
"...Mmnmh.":Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Just leave them by the mead casks."Sigyn:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano lifts his hat up
"...Whitney?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Oh good gracious, Whitney!"
Nephi "Longiron" Delano jumps up and, without even really realizing what he was doing, hugs her
Sigyn leans against the stones of the fire pit.
Hod rubs at his filmy eyes with a distracted hand.
"Yes ma'am!"Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire toddles off
"Yes! Yes so good to see you again..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Whitney we gotta get outta here."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Crystal Saint Claire sets her lunch down next to the fountain. She's still a bit groggy, and half-blind, so
she doesn't notice Whitney... until she speaks.
"Whitney!!"Crystal Saint Claire:
Whitney G. Elieen smiles at him...and her smile grows all the wider as Crystal walks into the scene!
"Something really weird's going on around-"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is still hugging
Whitney G. Elieen reaches her arms out!
Crystal Saint Claire almost TACKLES Whitney.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano realizes this and coughs, backing up
Whitney G. Elieen engulfs Crystal in a hug. Picking the much smaller woman up
Crystal Saint Claire hugs Whitney as tight as she can. Which... still isn't very tight.
"God be praised that I may see you again!"Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen says as she sets Crystal down
"...Er."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"When y'all two are finished."
"How worried I was...sorry. I may have come sooner had it not been for falling into the river."Whitney G. Elieen:
"There's funny business goin on around here."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Whitney G. Elieen turns her head over to Nephi
Crystal Saint Claire is still hugging onto Whitney's leg.
"Now what mean you by "Funny business" She says, still holding Crystal close to herselfWhitney G. Elieen:
She's sort of babbling half to herself, half to Whitney the whole time.Crystal Saint Claire:
"Somethin real WEIRD. This place is wrong."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Cassie knew more, but I think she's..."
"We went through the woods and it was dark and scary and I almost got lost and Lyoop has

There's some red on your dress that was not there before you hugged Whitney.

Crystal Saint Claire immediately gets serious.
"You are injured. Show me."Crystal Saint Claire:
"We're gettin out of here soon as we find the red-handed man."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Heck, Cassie ate half a tin of coffee beans raw and it was the second most disgustin thing I ever did see."

Wow the dice are cursed today.
You take Whitney's left arm and examine it. There are five neat puncture wounds
there. Each one is leaking a little blood, but not much. You should get these disinfected and put a bandage on.
Wonderful Cowboy Land:
"Does anyone have some alcohol? Something stronger than mead would be preferable...
Or... garlic, garlic might make a suitible antiseptic..."
Crystal Saint Claire:
Crystal Saint Claire attempts to lead Whitney to the dining hall.
"...I do. If cider can be counted as such..."Whitney G. Elieen:
Crystal Saint Claire takes her cup of mead.
"Cider is insufficient. Something like whiskey."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Follow us nephi. There is much we must discuss of this place"Whitney G. Elieen:
Crystal Saint Claire picks up her plate.
"Miss Sigyn do you have any garlic?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"Whitney is hurt..."
"Ye-."Sigyn:
Whitney G. Elieen enters the building with a great big thunk
"Oh, I should have something for that."Sigyn:
Crystal Saint Claire takes a bite of meat and chews a little.
"Hello" She says, bowing her head.Whitney G. Elieen:
Sigyn digs around in the table in front of the mead casks.
"I am Whitney Elieen. I was led here by your friend..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"We need to clean the wound out, and dress it. Something that will not get infiected would
be good, a poultice of some sort."
Crystal Saint Claire:
"Greetings."Hod:
"Friend?"
"Best for puncture wounds."Crystal Saint Claire:0

"Yes."Whitney G. Elieen:
"..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano places a single hand on Whitney's shoulder. With effort.
"The native."Whitney G. Elieen:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano makes a face
"I heard someone was hurt?"Kyri:
"Yes...a simple injury"Whitney G. Elieen:
"I must have sustained it when i fell into the brook"
Whitney G. Elieen says as she holds her arm out
Sigyn bumps her head on the table as she emerges.
"Oh, Kyri, thank you."Sigyn:
"The blond haired woman."
Kyri nods and walks over to Whitney. She takes the injured arm and looks at it for a moment.
"...and is there something you need Nephi?" She says, turning her head to look at the much
smaller man attempting to put his hand on her shoulder
Whitney G. Elieen:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has to stand on tiptoes to manage it
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has a worried expression, but... Eventually sighs and pinches his nose
Hod scratches his chin for a while. He shrugs, and continues to set up mugs on the mead table.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano eventually wanders away to stand with his back to the wall
Kyri takes a strip of white cloth and a small bottle from a bag at her side. She uncorks the bottle and
pours it over Whitney's arm. The liquid stings for a moment. The red haired woman is winding the strip of
cloth around Whitney's arm in an eyeblink..
"This should keep you."Kyri:
"Are you a doctor too?"Crystal Saint Claire:
"What ho friend, I have not seen you in this fine hall before."Honir:
"What do you think of the mead?"
"I ease pain."Kyri:
Crystal Saint Claire sips at the mead.
"I would not call myself a doctor."Kyri:
"So you are a medic."Crystal Saint Claire:
"Thank you very much." She says with a smile. "it feels better already."Whitney G. Elieen:
"God bless you and the work you do."

"...thank you."Crystal Saint Claire:
Whitney G. Elieen clasps the hand of her afflicted arm...
Crystal Saint Claire goes back to holding on to Whitney's leg.
Kyri nods to Whitney and Crystal. Then walks back over to her spot at the far left table.
"A fine community it seems you have here..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"We are few, but we do get by."Sigyn:
"Mmmm..."Hod:
"There are many nordic communities here...few seem to follow in the old style though."Whitney G. Elieen:
"I am sorry to trouble you further...but I am both terribly thirsty and a bit hungry. Have you any fruits or
vegetables?"
"Our friend that kept the apple orchard has fallen to time, but I have kept up her duties."Hod:
Hod reaches under the counter and produces a box. He opens it to reveal it is full of apples.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is standing with one foot against the wall, arms crossed, eyes darting back and
forth every few minutes. Especially because there were more people here before his, ah... ""Watch""
than before*Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Perfect" She says with a smile. "These will do just fine."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Not talkative I suppose..."Honir:
"I do not have much but i can spare some payment for your genorisity"Whitney G. Elieen:
"It is appreciated, but not necessary. The feasting hall is open to any who come."Hod:
Whitney G. Elieen bows her head and reaches for an apple. "Thank you again...before i leave i hope to
return your kindess."
"Thank you Miss...?"Sigyn:
"Whitney Elieen."Whitney G. Elieen:
"A beautiful name."Sigyn:
"I am Sigyn."
"The man with the box of apples is called Hod."
(I gtg, sorry)Crystal Saint Claire:
"The man over to the right is called Honir."Sigyn:
(Is fine)
(See you later!~)Whitney G. Elieen:
"And you have met Kyri."Sigyn:
"The one sitting with her is called Tyr."

"I see...it is a pleasure to meet you Sigyn. Hod. You have a lovely home here...what of the
one in the woods?"
Whitney G. Elieen:
"The native?"
"Do you know him?"
"He showed me the way when I was lost."
"I'm afraid I do not know."Hod:
"Could you describe him?"
"Hhmmm...he seemed to have picked up a smoking habit..." She says with a frown.Whitney G. Elieen:
"He smoked several cigarettes during our time...not a very clean habit but I am not one to judge."
"...his nails were also long apparently."
"Sigyn...?"Hod:
"I don't know."Sigyn:
"Perhaps if Odin were here, but he has been gone for many winters."
"Odin...?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Was this the one who tended to the orchids?"
"No, he was the wisest among us."Sigyn:
"He kept our knowledge."
how much norse mythology would witty know(From Whitney G. Elieen):
"I see...where did he go to?"Whitney G. Elieen:
You the one with the character, tell me.(To Yuppie b.):
"A task befitting of the name."Whitney G. Elieen:
"At least what I know of the theology of the nordic people...a student of history?"
"Yes."Wonderful Cowboy Land:
*Sigyn:
"Where might he have gone do you think?" She says with a frown. "It is always a hard
thing...to leave home that is."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"We do not know."Sigyn:
"One day, he was simply gone."
"At first we believed he would be back."
"It is not the first time he has left on a sudden trip."
"But, he has yet to return."
"How long ago was this?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"I am very sorry to hear this...where did he go on these sudden trips? Did he ever say?"
"It was...long ago."Hod:
"I cannot recall, it must have been...at least a decade."

"Perhaps more."
"He has gone on most trips to find dear friends of ours who have fallen to the ill will of others."
"...I see. Quests of discovery and recovery...he sounds like a noble soul."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Only God might know where he is at this point. And she never tells easily...he is in my prayers. Wherever he
might be. As you are all in mine."
"This place is...I can't quite put my finger on it...there is a peace here, though maybe it is my time in the spring that
makes me say so."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano is still standing by the wall. Quietly listening in.
"We try to keep this place as it has always been."Sigyn:
"Peaceful, and sublime."
"A place to rest and recover."
"And so it has been." She says with a smile. "Though speaking of rest...I feel I must sit for a
time."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"Perhaps enjoy this apple you have kindly offered to me."
"Go ahead."Sigyn:
"Enjoy our hospitality, as we enjoy having you."
Whitney G. Elieen bows her head and smiles
"Thank you...and God bless."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen walks towards Nephi, with Crystal in tow
"Shall we dine outside then?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"...Yeah."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks at every one of the fellows he could see and, ultimately, doesn't see
anything worth starting a fuss over.
"Nice day for a picnic anyways."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Of course."Sigyn:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has to step around Whitney, unable to get to the door because of her prodicious
size.
"Come back if you need anything."Hod:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads out to the fountain, and turns to Whitney.
"So."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Whitney G. Elieen nods once before walking out.
"...yes Nephi?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"...You're not feeling bothered?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Everything here's... Too nice."
"Way too nice."

"Even the nice bits of Salt Lake ain't like this."
Whitney G. Elieen clenches her injured arm
"S'just..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"The strangeness is not lost on me, I assure you."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Am I insane for thinkin it's all just wrong somehow?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Any normal folk come here they'd probably be goin on about how wonderful everyone is."
"...I just get scared."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano slumps down by the fountain's base.
Nephi "Longiron" Delano has a bite from some bread from his rations.
"My experience in the woods has me worried as well...but I trust you are basing this off more
than just a strange feeling?"
Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen said as she takes a bite of her apple
"What Cassie said."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"This place shouldn't be here."
"Especially this statue because it used to be on the east coast or somethin like that."
"There's some kinda powerful mojo goin on around here."
"Alex'd probably know more but he's been practicin his devil magic or whatever he does for a while now."
"Look at that statue, Whitney."
"Looks like it's been here bout a hunderd years, yeah?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...hmmm...I may talk with Alex myself soon enough."Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen looks to the statue
"Either this place is older than the Union or there's somethin mighty strange goin
down."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"These lands have been here far longer then any kingdom of man..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"...who is to say what is true or not? The native who led me here..."
"Are you familar with him?"
"Whitney. We're in what was once Indian lands."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Ain't no way something like this could be here."
"Which is why it bothers me that it is so much."
"The native?"Whitney G. Elieen:
Whitney G. Elieen says with another bite of her apple
"Did you know him?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"No."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"The one with the long finger nails."Whitney G. Elieen:

"...hmmm."
"Someone told Alex about him.?Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"
"Who told Alex about him?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"What did he have to say?"
"I think it's whatever dark power Alex dealt with."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"He's in debt to the same thing Alex is."
Whitney G. Elieen nods her head."
"...I see."Whitney G. Elieen:
"I will need to speak with Alex...and the demon."
"Soon."
"I don't think any demon would exactly be willin to talk to a man o'god... Or, eh,
woman, as the case may be."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"If there is one thing demons love to do."Whitney G. Elieen:
"It is to talk"
"Besides. We have met before remember?"
"And to try to lead us astray, yeah."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...Yeah."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano nibbles on more bread.
Whitney G. Elieen sighs before taking a bite of her apple
"The native said if i wished to return to the spring that he would be back..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"...I'm here for ya, Whitney. If you need my gun or another man of faith, y'know?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I will await his arrival again." She said, smiling softly at him.Whitney G. Elieen:
"And thank you very much Nephi."
"This has been a...trying time for me. For us all..."
"But through God we can find strength."
"Heh. Where's all the Son of Joseph business you usually go with~?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Even in the face of darkness."Whitney G. Elieen:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano offers her an unbitten slice of bread
Whitney G. Elieen takes it with a smile. "It has been a long journey here...and besides. Son of Joseph or
not...we are all children of God."
"Your teacher is not my teacher but the gift is universal."Whitney G. Elieen:
"We sure are."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Whitney G. Elieen bites into it.
"Aw, shucks, I ain't never had the gift."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I've seen what the prophets and the Twelve can do."
"Nobody in my family's got it."
"Cept maybe my ma."
"They say every man with the priesthood can call down the power of the angels, but... Only a few of em can do it
on the regular, y'know?"
"We are all offered salvation, and so we all have the gift. That is the grandest miracle of
all...all else springs from the same fountain."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"It is hard to say why God does what she does...and selects who she does. But there is power to the word and to
faith. A real power...for the longest time only the greats of ancient times could be said to do what I can also do."
Whitney G. Elieen says as she produces her holy mug
Whitney G. Elieen drains the top a little before sipping
"I take it a sign that the second coming approaches...soon."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Miracles..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...Yer an adventist, right?"
Whitney G. Elieen hands the mug over to him
"Yes."Whitney G. Elieen:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano takes a little sip.
"Didn't they have that whole kerfuffle a while back?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Are you refering to the great dissapointment?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Yeah."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"...Mostly I remember my bishop laughin bout it. Seemed kinda mean."
"He wasn't the nicest fella. Er, not to talk bad bout the lord's servants."
"That is correct, yes. Miller falsly believed in his divine mathmatics. Our family was hit hard by
this...but from disappointment and failure can come greater faith and understanding"
Whitney G. Elieen:
"and it is fine"
"My father was not all that nice either."
Whitney G. Elieen said with another sigh. "For a man of God that is."
"Yeah. I remember hearin bout that. My condolences."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"But hey, we ever end up in Junkyard, yer comin for dinner."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano says matter-of-factly.
"My folks love meetin my friends, after all."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Ma's cookin is to diiie for, mmh."
Whitney G. Elieen smiles yet again after a brief moment of melencholic silence.

"I would like this very much Nephi."Whitney G. Elieen:
"I always enjoyed meeting others."
"Alma and Lehi would love to meet you too."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I just hope Helaman hasn't come back home."
"...He's more Rockett's speed."
"If you understand what I'm saying."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano frowns.
"I see..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"...Whitney, if it's any consolation, I'm sorry bout yer home life. It's a darn shame when
a kid doesn't have a good time with their folks.":
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
Nephi "Longiron" Delano gives Whitney her water back.
It was not water, but cider! Cold and crisp it seemed from the small sip you took.Whitney G. Elieen:
Ooh.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"It was just the one. The great disappointment turned him cruel and harsh. He blamed himself
and his family for his perceived damnation. It has been a long time..." She says in a distant tone. "They are in
heaven now. All but two of us. My mission calls me to rise above the scars of the past."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"To heal others and lead them above. That is my mission. Wounds of the past will remain there and will eventually
be wiped clean by the grace of God."
"Well, you've been doing a good job of it so far."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"It is not enough. I pray God will grant me the power to do more soon. To fend off evil and to
heal the sick. Of body and mind."
Whitney G. Elieen:
"All you have seen comes from her. And it is only the begining."
Whitney G. Elieen sighs again as she takes a bite of her apple
"I just hope to be a worthy vessle. Now especially as we face darker powers..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"Yeah."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Haven't really started tusslin with the real bad ones just yet."
"They're out there, though. I seen one of them."
"One of them?"Whitney G. Elieen:
"Who did you see?"
"I call him the Ivory Rider."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano grips his rifle tight enough for his hand to go pale and start leaving a mark in the
wood
"That's the one."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"I'm not common to all these stories of vampires and whorewolves and gribbly-gnawies."
"...But he's probably The Adversary's right-hand man."
"I told you bout my... Old friends, right?"
"Used to have another posse I traveled with."
"...you mentioned them before I believe..."Whitney G. Elieen:
"One was a doctor from engaland. A priest from some parts of the east of Europe.
Some two-bit drifter, a union soldier, and..."
Nephi "Longiron" Delano:
"Heh. "Mister Alexander Hardin, No Relation". Always made me laugh a bit when he said that."
"We were all lookin for a treasure buried out in Kansas when it... Happened."
"He showed up. Everything went dark. I heard screams."

"...But he showed up again, just before we left Dodge."
"I mentioned it."
"He carved somethin into my pop's rifle too."
