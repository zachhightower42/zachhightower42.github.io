I really hope you can just copy the entire sheet from Poage's game when you get rights thereCassie May:

Oh hi Yuppie.

and take a gander at the characters again

Now she can pretend to be of normal height

Reginald Percival Grenfell FLEXES.

lol good healthy living is what has made me tallWhitney G. Elieen:

Whitney G. Elieen PRAYS

"Incredible valor."
Said Reginald

"RESPECTABLE MUSCLES."

"Unshakeable faith"
Said Whitney

"GOD IS MY ROCK"

Reginald Percival Grenfell extends a hand to Whitney and bends down to one knee in one motion.

"Miss Whitney."
Said Reginald

"Would you make me the most happy man that has ever walked these dust covered lands?"

"Oh Sir Reginald..." She says with a smile as she pulls him up to his feet. Perhaps one of few

who can actually do such a thing.

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Walk with me and become the happiest man to have lived. Both on the dusty roads of earth and the golden

streets of the city eternal."

Reginald Percival Grenfell swoons with a whole lot of ham. He manages to take out two ceiling lights and

leave a good dent in a side of the train.

"Oh this is wonderful."
Said Reginald

"Our children will have faith and joy passed down their line FOR GENERATIONS!"

"I HAVE PRAYED TO THE HEAVENS TO DELIVER UNTO ME A MAN NOT AFRAID OF MY

HEIGHT AND GOD GIVEN STRENGTH AND THE LORD HAS HEARD MY PRAYERS"

Whitney G. Elieen:

"REJOICE FOR GOD IS GOOD"

Reginald Percival Grenfell grabs Whitney and lifts her up as tears of joy run down his chiseled jawline.

"...Ah really need ta quit drinkin'."
Said Callie

Whitney G. Elieen swoons like a southern girl in the spiritual heat of an awakening. Taking out the entire

side of the train in the process of doing so.

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire runs away crying.

Crystal Saint Claire runs into a door.

Crystal Saint Claire just lays there

(That could happen but it would take years to create properly.)Crystal Saint Claire:

WhyCrystal Saint Claire:

S'just meming.

Arvo didn't kill TFN

BANI didn't kill TFN

T-TCrystal Saint Claire:

OH hey Doc

...I forgotCrystal Saint Claire:

Wait I remembered

Can we talk tomorrow about my first Gizmo?

And what it can be?Crystal Saint Claire:

Night for now everyone.

Hello.Crystal Saint Claire:

Ye conscious?

what is up?Crystal Saint Claire:

Who is this?

This is Doc's room.Crystal Saint Claire:

One minute, I'll get a link to mine and we can transfer it overCrystal Saint Claire:

Your character is a ham.

AAH NUUAAOH

Nevermore explodes into a shower of memes

Cassie-May O'Brien updated her character sheet a bit

Nevermore is also going to update my sheet.

even more ammo, a saber, speedloaders, more knives, loads of spare clothes, (assless)

Cassie-May O'Brien:

I need to buy some spare clothing

Yuppie b. almost forgot her Saturday dress

It'll be the perfect time

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Alrighty.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Your sheet all up to standards, Alexander?

There's two of me.Alexander Hauswald:

We'll delete whichever one is less complete.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Aaaalright.Alexander Hauswald:

Then yes. I'm done.

Now we're going to introduce you!Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

I think I'm done updatin' my sheetCassie-May O'Brien:

very busy

right now

He's probably reading the 2000 page reading assignment he just got.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Because he implied it was not game related, but ofactual importance.

It is in fact school related. He will get to us when he has time. There are other things he also has to do

ontop of that.

I'm starting to think thatCassie-May O'Brien:

Cassie is some sort of a bootleg Kiddo

crazy prepared

Large and hardy, Faithful and gentle, and maybe a little unsettled.

I have no idea who Alexander is supposed to beAlexander Hauswald:

I already HAVE a gun-wizard OC and they're nothing alike

Frozen and Pill are actually other people's characters. Frozen in particular is Varmus's who is currently

in a relationship with my tortured war criminal deer. Pill is a "Stock priest character" and you of course know who

Kara is.

Frozen is a nearly unkillable, masculine lumberjack.Cassie-May O'Brien:

Nearly unkillable as in really clings to life absurdly hard.

Not invincible, despite my best efforts.

I rememberAlexander Hauswald:

Most people don't fucking survive something called "shotgun abortion"

PfftCassie-May O'Brien:

old news

she forgave the mare that shot her

hug and all

she also has been shot through with a literal cannon like three times so farCassie-May O'Brien:

damaged so badly that she's literally on Dark Magic life support now

Will putting her in a 40k-style dreadnaught be a downgrade?Alexander Hauswald:

To top it off she is in love with a sometimes promiscuous deer who at times keeps secrets and is

almost as tortured as her. Mentally at least.

She is also one hundred times more masculine than said deer.

ActuallyCassie-May O'Brien:

she already was in something like that

literal power armor.

then those disappeared after they timetravelled because an ancient time golem told them to

do so or he deletes reality.

Cassie-May O'Brien:

An armored coffin powered solely by her rageAlexander Hauswald:

There is no rage left in Frozen HorizonCassie-May O'Brien:

just exhaustion, disappointment, confusion and feeling of utter powerlessness.

Welcome back!Whitney G. Elieen:

And he's still a penguin

he jsut wears a cowboy hat, and nobody questions it.

Except for the Ranger.

Crystal just assumes he's from Pittsburgh

"The all have that accent!"
Said Crystal

I need some help wit a number or two, and some gear..

Got the numbers fixedCrystal Saint Claire:

But I need gear help

I have all this money

Why do you have all this moneyNephi "Longiron" Delano:

...Why do you have that muchNephi "Longiron" Delano:

I took 2-point DineroCrystal Saint Claire:

Rich kidAlexander Hauswald:

Crystal has a rich uncleCrystal Saint Claire:

...OookayNephi "Longiron" Delano:

A rich uncle who got too touchy-feely?

NoCrystal Saint Claire:

Anyways.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Buy mad science stuff.

And if you insinuate that she will point whatever project she is holding at youCrystal Saint Claire:

You got any Horse Riding skill?Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

I can't make horses better, can I?Crystal Saint Claire:

You can!Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

You can make it fasta.

Oh nooooooooNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Smart Horse

Smarty horsyWhitney G. Elieen:

I am buying oneCrystal Saint Claire:

My Horse is SMart

Will it also be smarter than Nephi?Alexander Hauswald:

My horse isWhitney G. Elieen:

Need to think of a name...Crystal Saint Claire:

Not Horsey McHorseface before any of you say it

Call him SpeedweedAlexander Hauswald:

That's what she should call the automobile she'll create

HEr.Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal got a mare.

A good idea? PErhaps not.

But at lwast this way there's not a huge dong floppin' all over the place.

PrincessAlexander Hauswald:

Because it makes a Clip Clop noise.

Whitney's horse shall be namedWhitney G. Elieen:

Because it's a mare with an ass like a stallion?Crystal Saint Claire:

And deceptively good witha rifle?Crystal Saint Claire:

yesWhitney G. Elieen:

I'm picturing WhitneyCrystal Saint Claire:

"Give the horse the rifle."

"What?"
Said Crystal

"Give. The horse. The rifle."

"That shot was half a mile! How did she even pull the trigger!"

Alexander isn't good at names, no.Alexander Hauswald:

's horse is called

Something long and fartsyAlexander Hauswald:

BartlesbyCrystal Saint Claire:

That or his horse got lost in the shipment and now he has to ride a mule.Alexander Hauswald:

...Crystals horse is named Susan.Crystal Saint Claire:

I did that on accident

I was going with Mary Sue

But I accidentallied a Johnny Test

WHIP-CRACK SOUND EFFECT INTO SMASH CUTCrystal Saint Claire:

....So anywayAlexander Hauswald:

We doing anything orrrr

I'm asking because it's 2 AM hereAlexander Hauswald:

So you could be somewhere on the train. We haven't explored it much... Ask doc if he has

preferences on how you're introduced, maybe?

Crystal Saint Claire:

Ah wouldn' mind meetin' up another pardnah in this lil' endeavour.Cassie-May O'Brien:

Game time is gonna be fun for you.

As long as it's on weekends, I'll survive.Alexander Hauswald:

We should scheduleCrystal Saint Claire:

because I literally cannot friday, saturday, Sunday.

Most likely scenario

LikeAlexander Hauswald:

Right now is the best

Oh.Crystal Saint Claire:

I could work this.

On this day.

sameCassie-May O'Brien:

Same.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

We'd miss Varulv, tho.

Yeah...Crystal Saint Claire:

He went to bed, didn't he.

He did.Crystal Saint Claire:

Went to sleep.

YeahNephi "Longiron" Delano:

So if we started games today, likean hour agoCrystal Saint Claire:

So.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

What if we start like

He'd pass out an hour and a half inCrystal Saint Claire:

Threeee hours agoNephi "Longiron" Delano:

I could do that. Unsure about anyone elseCrystal Saint Claire:

And also Doc is a person

I can do that.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

This is true.

I'd do that tooAlexander Hauswald:

I could do that myselfWhitney G. Elieen:

Hell no, we have to get Varulv, Doc, Varmus...Crystal Saint Claire:

I think just them.

Oh and Moondew

So I think

If Crystal was using a shotgun

It would be...

But I am unsure.Crystal Saint Claire:

You may, if you wish.Crystal Saint Claire:

You don't need my permission.

I mean, I'm curious because you might need me around.Alexander Hauswald:

Did you ask Doc if he had anything planned for your introduction?Crystal Saint Claire:

If he doesn't then we could probably write you in on the spot, no?

But if he does then I don't wanna step on that.

So we are probably not the ones to talk to about whether you're gonna be needed or not.

Right.Crystal Saint Claire:

So I guess you can sleep.0000

Whatever it may be, I'm sure it can't wait.Alexander Hauswald:

Becuase until he doe come aroundCrystal Saint Claire:

Could be five mintues, could be six hours

We can't progress, because we might step on his toes.

Aight.Alexander Hauswald:

Prceed. not progress. wrong word.Crystal Saint Claire:

Good night.

I'm going to take a little nap.

Thirty minutes.

I will be back.

That wokre me upCrystal Saint Claire:

I had five minutes on the timer left.

You are a wonderful person.

I feel like there is a "however" in here somewhere

I'm telling you something that is both true and will make you feel better to make up for waking up early

with memes.

...oh.Crystal Saint Claire:

Unless it's Nev.

And he knows I'm joking.

It's ok you didn't knowCrystal Saint Claire:

I think Link and Varulv are both asleep...

I should be finished sometime soon ish with the meat of the work I've got to do.

okCrystal Saint Claire:

Followed by Alexander's.

Just let me know when! I'm gonna check in every 20 minutes or soCrystal Saint Claire:

If you wanna do anything just let me know!Crystal Saint Claire:

Nevermore comes in dancing

Nephi "Longiron" Delano dances

DANCINGNephi "Longiron" Delano:

HAVING A GOOD TIME

Wonderful Cowboy Land comes down out of the sky and smites Nephi with skeletonic lazer eyes.

UuuuaaAAAAAAAAAAA-Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano rematerializes a few inches away

HAAAHNephi "Longiron" Delano:

...Hello ladies.

Crystal Saint Claire is hiding behind Whitney after all that

Crystal ends up hiding in the gigantic dress that Whitney wore.Whitney G. Elieen:

I like to imagine Crystal can wear Whitney's shirt as a dress.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

This is accurateCrystal Saint Claire:

This is almost a certainty.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is leaning against the door of the train, canteen in hand, looking out over the

miles of countryside rolling by.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks out into the distance, almost like he can see something out there. His gaze

Crystal Saint Claire hesitantly approaches.

"...what are you looking at?"
Said Crystal

"...Countryside."
Said Nephi

"Wondering how far we are from Utah right now."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano takes a sip from his canteen

"...You holding up? I'm sorry if I scared you earlier."
Said Nephi

"..."
Said Crystal

"Roughly one-thousand and ten miles."

"...Well, I got no idea how to check anyways, so I'll take your word for it."
Said Nephi

"...You remind me a lot of my younger sisters, you know."

"You mentioned this."
Said Crystal

"They got all the brains in the family anyhow."
Said Nephi

Crystal Saint Claire is digging through the carpet bag she carries everywhere.

"I got all the brains. Got everything. Only child."
Said Crystal

"Sorry to hear that."
Said Nephi

"It did not make much difference."
Said Crystal

"It does, though."
Said Nephi

"I am glad I had no siblings."
Said Crystal

"You never have to fight for nothin. Don't gotta battle for scraps at the family table."
Said Nephi

"They would have had to meet my parents."
Said Crystal

"I was never real good at that. Heh, you wonder how I got to be so darn skinny?"
Said Nephi

"...never had to fight?"
Said Crystal

"I'd squabble with my siblins all the time."
Said Nephi

Crystal Saint Claire is suddenly looking at you. Not quite sad, closer to angry.

"Who gets the last piece of bacon, who gets what toy, who gets to go shootin with

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Y'gotta have siblings to know it like that."

"I suppose."
Said Crystal

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Competition without consequence."
Said Crystal

"Ain't nothin to be afriad of here."
Said Nephi

"..."
Said Crystal

Nephi "Longiron" Delano kneels down to be on Crystal's level.

"You ever need anythin or anyone's hurtin you, you hollar and I'll come help, alright?"
Said Nephi

Crystal Saint Claire is rummaging through the bag, but freezes as Nephi comes down to her level.

"..."
Said Crystal

Nephi "Longiron" Delano resists the urge to give her a friendly pat on the head, and returns to looking out

of the window.

"Please step away"
Said Crystal

"Awright. As you like it."
Said Nephi

"...thank you"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire relaxes.

"You remind me... of my uncle."
Said Crystal

"Heh, really?"
Said Nephi

"He the good kind?"

"Yes."
Said Crystal

"He is why I am not dead."

"I'm actually an uncle now myself. Oldest brother had his first baby not long before I

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"That is good."
Said Crystal

"Got back from his mission and had his girl arm in arm."
Said Nephi

"Real wild child from Mexico."

"Had tattoos and everything. But she joined the church, and if it's good enough for ma and pa, it's good enough for

"I hope she is happy now."
Said Crystal

"Yeah. Can't help but wonder how they're all doin. Probably gonna send a wire home

when we get to Kansas City."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"I will contact my uncle."
Said Crystal

"Perhaps Professor Cecil."

"Professor Cecil... He the one who trained you Back East?"
Said Nephi

"Yes."
Said Crystal

"He is a professor of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."

(brb)Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

(ok)Crystal Saint Claire:

(Back)Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Well shoot, he must be pretty smart if he taught a clever girl like yew!"

"..."
Said Crystal

"The contest. The one you have going with Ranger Mathers."

"I have a request, if you would be willing to hear it..."

"...Yeah?"
Said Nephi

Crystal Saint Claire pulls out a strange-looking revolver from the carpetbag. It looks unused, and there are

strange runes stamped shallowly into the surface.

"Would you be willing to use this?"
Said Crystal

"Whoa!"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano nearly jumps out of his skin at the girl drawing a revolver on him

"C-careful with that, guns ain't a toy, y'know!"
Said Nephi

Crystal Saint Claire is pointing it at the ground, holding it by the barrel.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano realizes this after a second

"..."
Said Nephi

"I am aware. I am trained in safety procedures concerning these sorts of things."
Said Crystal

"I ain't really a good pistol shot, unfortunately."
Said Nephi

"Ma only taught me how to use rifles."

"How are you with shotguns?"
Said Crystal

"And dad showed me how to shoot the newfangled automatics."
Said Nephi

"Don't do well with those either. The kickback near broke my shoulder last time."

"...hm..."
Said Crystal

"Tell you what, you're free to tinker with the guns I got, alright?"
Said Nephi

"Are you sure?"
Said Crystal

"Positive."
Said Nephi

"That's a sciencey term, right?"

"Any modifications straying from the factory standards could cause a notable decrease in

the reliability of the firearm..."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"I got another rifle, you know."
Said Nephi

"Lightning repeater. It's a hand me down, but it's the same one my big brothers used. If it was good enough for

"Lever-action, or revolver?"
Said Crystal

"Revolver!"
Said Nephi

"It's a revolvin rifle."

"Got a slide you pull between shots."

"I could try to alter the mechanism, to make it a little smoother, but any change I can make

has probably already been tried somewhere."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"That's fair. Miss Callie uses pistols, though. If you think she's cotton to tryin it out, be

my guest."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"I know I'm gonna win."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano grins wide, brimming with confidence.

"She ain't got a chance, weird science gizmo or no. I'm the best there's ever been."
Said Nephi

"And I know just the way to prove it..."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano goes back to looking out the window...

"I'll be ready for you soon..."
Said Nephi

"Does it involve shooting a renowned sniper?"
Said Crystal

"...Naw."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has a peculiar look on his face. The kind of look a man gets when his most

trusted friend has just told him his pa just crawled out of the grave.

"...Else."
Said Nephi

"Don't feel like talkin bout it."

"You seem distressed. I will discontinue this line of conversation."
Said Crystal

"Ain't your fault. Just thinkin bout what I gotta do."
Said Nephi

"Have you considered options for close-quarters combat?"
Said Crystal

"...Don't even know if it was real."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is quite a bit taller than Crystal, sure, but just as skinny.

"Do I look like the kinda fella that's good in a brawl?"
Said Nephi

"Yes. You are not strong. Hand-to-hand capabilities likely lacking."
Said Crystal

"Well ya don't gotta put it like that!"
Said Nephi

"What you have to be so mean for..."

"That is why any brawler with an ounce of sense will target you first."
Said Crystal

"Hey, think you can ah..."
Said Nephi

"If they get too close for the rifle to be reliable..."
Said Crystal

"Come up with sometin like the rebs have?"
Said Nephi

"With the pistol that has a shotgun too?"

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire pulls the pistol slightly further from the carpetbag, revealing the shotgun attachment.

"...Niiice."
Said Nephi

"Think you could fit one on my rifle?"

"That'd be a way better surprise than some bayonet."

"...I am currently attempting to prototype something to that effect."
Said Crystal

"It would be odd, and similar to tying a shotgun to your rifle."

"The reason it works with the pistol is that a shotgun and a pisto, are about the same size, mechanism-wise."

"Perhaps the way to do it would be to use the same hammer mechanism... And simply place a full shotgun barrel

beneath the rifle's barrel?"

"It would likely need to be made of ghost steel."

"Otherwise it would become prohibitively heavy."

"Unless a sawed-off length barrel was used."
Said Crystal

"But then one would have to use a separate trigger mechanism for the shotgun, adding more maintainence and

potential for error."

Crystal Saint Claire rummages through her bag for paper and writing stuff.

"..."
Said Nephi

"Why don't you just

"Put a really really long switch on it."

"..."
Said Crystal

"I do not follow."

"Like"
Said Nephi

"Just make the trigger for the shotgun like..."

"Like a rod you pull."

"Perhaps if there was a safety to disengage first..."
Said Crystal

"Attach it to the side of the body"
Said Nephi

"Then you pull it when somethin uppity gets too close."

"Maybe like"

"Twist it first?"

"If there is not a safety, shifting one's grip on the firearm might cause premature gunfire..."
Said Crystal

"One moment."

"...Yeah you work on that."
Said Nephi

"I'll be here. Wouldn't be the first time I was used as a guinea pig."

"Ishmael would mix elixirs into my morning juice."

"I think I have something rough..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire has drawn a diagram.

"You would have to push forward, twist counter-clockwise, and then pull back, firing the

Crystal Saint Claire:

"...Maybe it'll make sense when I'm lookin at it."
Said Nephi

"I am unsure how to create a foolproof safety..."
Said Crystal

"You'll figure it out. Ah got faith."
Said Nephi

"Okay. So..."
Said Crystal

"If you were pointing the gun forward

There would be a grip of some sort."

"Which hand do you not pull the trigger with?"

"And we still got a ways to travel, so you figure it...."
Said Nephi

"I'm a lefty. So my right."

"Your right hand would be supporting the gun."
Said Crystal

"Yep."
Said Nephi

"And where it usually lies, there could be some sort of grip.Crystal Saint Claire:

"You push the grip forward until you hear a click, then turn left until you hear another click, then push forward to

"No wait you pull back to fire."

"It would take practice to make the motion smooth..."

"But it would be kind of a..."

Crystal Saint Claire mimes the action.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano stands there, listening to Crystal ramble with a faint smile, occasionally

muttering a "Mmhmm"

Crystal Saint Claire looks like she's giving someone at her shoulder height a handjob REALLY SLOWLY.

"..."
Said Nephi

"Like this?"
Said Crystal

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has no idea what that is either.

"Yeah, actually, looks pretty good."{Nephi "
Said Longiron

Nephi "Longiron" Delano says with utmost sincerity.

"...Somethin..."
Said Nephi

"Somethin seems weird about it, though. Can't quite put my finger on it."

"Maybe get some thoughts from the Ranger and the..."

"The rugged girl? They're shooters too."

"Well, perhaps it is just a difficult motion"
Said Crystal

"Keep workin on it. You'll get it.":Nephi "
Said Longiron

"When it comes time to build it, you let me know. I learned a thing or two from watchin Ish' work."

I just remembered what you can spend your cash on.

A better lab setup.

(I can, but there's more potential for shit to go south and anything larger than the carpetbag

is not portable.)

Crystal Saint Claire:

(The one step up is. It's a cart, but it's technically portable)Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"...Like I said. Hollar if you need me, I'm going to be catchin some fresh air."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads out the door.

Hey neb.

Draw a card for me.

"I will."
Said Crystal

Two of spades.

A Deuce.Crystal Saint Claire:

...Crystal Saint Claire:

A Duece, but slightly strongerCrystal Saint Claire:

It will be interesting.

Gonna lie down now.

Due to an unfortunate coincidence

Crystal is going to be terrified of Reginald for a not-insignificant time.

Like how Reginald's is.

At least as far as he's aware himself.

Because I drew BOTH DAMN JOKERS

Grab the VotWW, for a triple vammy.

Wouldn't make sense on the character

But I did get a pretty good hand.

S'just so much harder to keep track of who I've told wht to.

Take a read!

Crystal Saint Claire has a backstory

AnywhoCrystal Saint Claire:

Someone getting a punchin' if they ever come around.

Train is chugga chugga chugging alongCrystal Saint Claire:

...pls no punch me

Of course not! A gentleman would never pay a finger on a lady.Reginald Percival Grenfell:

To my knowledge, he never hit her.Crystal Saint Claire:

There are other things covered by 'laying a finger on' than punching.Reginald Percival Grenfell:

We could do a late-night stop.Crystal Saint Claire:

All the others are asleep, or something.

That also works.Reginald Percival Grenfell:

Crystal Saint Claire promised to stop staying up late for Whitney but sometimes she gets ideas in the

middle of the night

Crystal Saint Claire is currently in the dining car, the only place with big enough tables to contain her

Reginald Percival Grenfell was one of the newest arrivals on the train, having gotten on-board at its latest

stop. In fact, he had only just gotten on to the train and found his own compartment, before deciding that

a little night time-drink was the perfect way to round off the day. As he stepped into the dining car, three

things made him stand out from likely anyone else on board: his clothing was near sparkling clean, hardly

a fold to be seen. Not in the coat - that was clearly of military origin, but did not belong to any American

army - or the perfectly tailored suit he wore underneath. Then was his hat, a bowler that one would be

hard pressed to find anyone else in the States wearing. A walking cane despite not seeming like he

needed such aid. And finally: he was huge. In both good senses of the word. So tall he had to lean

forward slightly to get through the doorway, and enough muscles to likely put even a horse to shame.

Reginald Percival Grenfell pauses for a moment after entering and looks around, a light, non-bothered,

smile on his face. Only noticing Crystal, he removes his hat and casually approaches.

Crystal Saint Claire is tinkering with something on a table, currently rummaging in her carpet bag. She

waves back over her shoulder.

"I know I said I would sleep Whitney but I had a breakthrough"
Said Crystal

"I promise, just one more hour"

"Forgive my intrusion, madam, but would you happen to know if this establishment

offers nighttime services?" His voice did not at all match the body, seeming more at home with an actor, or singer.

Reginald Percival Grenfell:

"..."
Said Crystal

Reginald Percival Grenfell removes his hat, revealing a mostly bald head.

Crystal Saint Claire freezes the moment she hears the unfamiliar voice.

The sound of a revolver cocking is distinctive, and carries at least across a silent dining hall.Crystal Saint Claire:

Reginald Percival Grenfell raises an eyebrow at the sound, but does not seem bothered by it otherwise.

Crystal Saint Claire turns very slowly, one hand in the carpet bag, the other holding onto the table

The moment she actually sees Reginald, she's off and running.Crystal Saint Claire:

"Apologies if I frightened you, madam." He offers a light bow, hat head against his

Reginald Percival Grenfell:

Her work is left on the table.Crystal Saint Claire:

"Oh bother."
Said Reginald

You can hear footsteps going down the train.Crystal Saint Claire:

Reginald Percival Grenfell moves to the table, looking over the assorted items strewn about with mild

curiosity and interest. After studying it for a moment while rubbing his chin thoughtfully, he grabs at bag

and stoves everything down into it, then heads off after the running girl in an attempt to catch up with her.

She is 15 years of age.Crystal Saint Claire:

How careful are you with that? It looks like delicate machinery; clockwork.

Rrrrelatively. Everything goes in the bag, but it's not 'arm on table, brush it all in in

one motion'.

Reginald Percival Grenfell:

Got it.Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire has locked herself in a sleeping car.

How certain would it be that any one of them was hers?Reginald Percival Grenfell:

She didn't lock herself in her room. Just the first one she could find.Crystal Saint Claire:

Would he have seen her enter?Reginald Percival Grenfell:

The train is pretty unoccupied.Crystal Saint Claire:

He would have seen her take a hard left into a room, likely.

Reginald Percival Grenfell carefully knocks on the door. "Apologies for scaring you, miss, and for still

"If yer don't step back oi'm gonna shoot."
Said Crystal

I shall be on my way."

Reginald Percival Grenfell:

"..."
Said Crystal

"Jist put de bag down an' walk away."

The sounds of furniture moving are evident from the other side of the door.

"If you are certain, miss, but this is not like back home. The gents of these lands do

not have the tact to simply leave unattended belongings be."

Reginald Percival Grenfell:

The sound of a bag with... what ever all she has in it can be heard

"I wish you a pleasant evening." And with that, heavy footsteps leaving - back towards the dining cart - can be

(Thanks for the time! I gotta go..)Crystal Saint Claire:

Nevermore turns up

Nephi "Longiron" Delano needs a bro

As long as you don't steal my sweet Banjo music.

...So I know I'm being a nitpicky cunt but can I get my two questions answered so I could leave

everyone alone

This guy?

He's not born for another thirty four yearsNephi "Longiron" Delano:

...Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

His grandfather.

Who happens to have almost the same name.

And who is almost illiterate

And you are a former Pinkerton but took up private dick work when the agency got partially absorbed

into the U.S. Government.

That alright?

WhyNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Fair enough.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

I will get the nice, better detailed, backstory to you later.

Are you guys waiting for me to do a thing for the intro?

Because I can probably spare a few minutes to get it going and give you some ambiance.

Take your time, really. Watching Double King again.

I'm ready\Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

YESNephi "Longiron" Delano:

I can actually play the dulcimer, which is a similar instrument.

But can you do it in overalls????:

Yes actually.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Look up Steve N' Seagulls Thunderstruck cover.

That has all the banjo you could ever need.

I have collected.

Much banjo.

Yes.Alexander Hauswald:

Let me just rev up the everything.

I cannot use the map

It's a late night when the stop comes up. The train's engine stops chuffing out smoke

and the huge metal beast grinds to a halt. There are two men on the platform. One of them looks fine. The other

looks like death warmed over. The man that looks fine has a suitcase and a dog. The man that looks like he

belongs six feet under has a suitcase tucked under both arms. There is a cobalt six gun on his hip.

Crystal Saint Claire tests sonetgibg

Oj that works kindaCrystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire is still holes up in second-guess, having barricaded a sleeper car.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is nearby where Crystal is staying.

"Hey, Missy Crystal? We've stopped."
Said Nephi

"You wanna see who's gonna get on?"

"...Y'been in there an awful long while."

"..."
Said Crystal

"....is he still on the train?"

"Ishmael would get like that sometimes. She'd always come out for ma's cookin

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"...Who's still on the train?"

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks out the window.

"Oh hey, this guy's got a dog."
Said Nephi

"...the monster"
Said Crystal

Alexander Hauswald waits for the train to come to a full stop, his face neutral. He checks- one last time-

that his suitcase and the gun on his hip are still there, and that Sacks is held on the leash.

"...Dunno what you're talking about, but I don't think there's any monsters about. I'm

going to go greet the new fellas, eh?"

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Cassie-May O'Brien came over with another mug of tea. Come to think of it, you don't think she slept

since you met her.

"Whuh, we takin' passengers?"
Said Cassie-May

"...Hey there miss Cassie."
Said Nephi

"Yep, looks like it. Ungodly hour, too."
Said Nephi

"..."
Said Crystal

"Howdy."
Said Cassie-May

"And that's when the damn thing took my leg off."
Said Wily

Cassie-May O'Brien sipped her coffee.

"Crystal's still keepin herself locked in a room."
Said Nephi

The sounds of moving furniture are evident from the other side of the door.Crystal Saint Claire:

"Someone come on that scared the poor girl?"
Said Nephi

"Reminds me, I ever ask your name train waiting buddy?"
Said Wily

"No. No you did not."
Said Alexander

Moondew rouses from her nap. "Wha's goin' on? Ah musta drifted off."

"Hey there ranger."
Said Nephi

"Knew I was forgetting something."
Said Wily

"We're stoppin."
Said Nephi

"Didn't ask either. Sacks did, though."
Said Alexander

"Some fella's getting on."
Said Nephi

Cassie-May O'Brien leans out of the window to take a good look at the two.

"Yer shittin' me, we're finally gonna get off this damn train?"
Said Callie

"Nope, takin on another passenger."
Said Nephi

"Well I'm Galen, Wily Galen."
Said Wily

"Maybe two."
Said Nephi

"One of em's got some kinda dog."

Crystal Saint Claire looks like she hasn't slept in at least 24 hours.

"Work up in Kansas city."
Said Wily

Alexander Hauswald points at the dog by his side. For the life of you, you can't tell what this thing is.

You're not entirely sure it's a DOG.

"Hey Miss Crystal."
Said Nephi

"Alexander Hauswald."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald pauses. And offers his hand for a shake.

"Bounty hunter."
Said Alexander

"Nice to meet you Hauswald."
Said Wily

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers looks at the... thing. "Uhh, good... doggy? Ah think?"

"...Delano."
Said Crystal

"Yeah?"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano peeks in.

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers blinks and then shakes his hand. "Callie Mathers. Texas Ranger."

Wily Galen places his hand in Alexander's for a shake. Galen's hand is cold, far too cold.

ErrNephi "Longiron" Delano:

(Callie we're not on the train yet)Alexander Hauswald:

Alex is on the platformNephi "Longiron" Delano:

...OhCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

You're on the trainNephi "Longiron" Delano:

DerpCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

It's alright.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Uhh... Ranger magicCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

Crystal Saint Claire has put almost every moveable object in the room against the door.

"..."
Said Nephi

"Well, I'm going to get on up."
Said Wily

Crystal Saint Claire squeezes out.

"Been up for..."
Said Wily

"A while."

"I could sue a good nap."

"...You can borrow my rifle if it'll help you feel safer."
Said Nephi

"Uhh... what's with the redecoratin'?"
Said Callie

Nephi "Longiron" Delano says to crystal.

Alexander Hauswald doesn't seem to be disturbed- or, rather, if he is, he does a fantastic job hiding it.

"Fair enough."

"I have the Opus."
Said Crystal

"...Fair."
Said Nephi

Alexander Hauswald snaps his finger at the mongrel by his feet. "Come on, Sacks. We're going."

"Whatcha need me for, Miss Crystal?"
Said Nephi

Wily Galen steps up onto the train with a little jig and heads towards the sleeper compartments. He walks

past most of the others on the way there. He leaves behind a peculiar smell of light rot.

"To explain to Whitney if I must abscond."
Said Crystal

Nephi "Longiron" Delano coughs at the stench that passes by.

"...Yeah, sure, miss Crystal. I ken do that."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks back, anticipating the other entrant.

"..."
Said Crystal

"...I don't trust him either, Sacks. Still. We go where we called."
Said Alexander

Crystal Saint Claire walks after the slightly rotted man

Alexander Hauswald follows, tugging gently on the leash.

Cassie-May O'Brien wiggled her nose.

"Excuse me, sir? Why do you smell of Death? Are you one of the mortially challenged?"
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien tensed up.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is standing near the door of the first train compartment.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks out as Alexander approaches.

Wily Galen opens a sleeper compartment with his foot and pokes his head in to look around. After

ascertaining that no one is occupying it, he trots in and tosses both suitcases down.

Does Cassie-May recognize this person from her earlier misadventures or

(From Cassie-May O'Brien):

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers sniffs, getting a good whiff of the smell. "Well shoot, looks like we might jus'

have some... 'musical accompaniment' durin' our travels."

This one is new.(To Cassie-May O'Brien):

he is a walking dead like the others, though? Can Cassie recognize that?(From Cassie-May O'Brien):

Alexander Hauswald looks at Nephi, the stoic emotion on his face softening ever so slightly, before he

nods. "Hello."

Wily Galen twirls around on his heels and bends down to look at Crystal.

"Howdy, friend!"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano offers a hand forward to shake.

"Oh, hi."
Said Wily

"Welcome to the motleyest crew this side of the rockies."
Said Nephi

"Good evening."
Said Crystal

"Also yes."
Said Wily

Nephi "Longiron" Delano says, with a chuckle.

Cassie-May O'Brien nods at the dog-haver.

"Howdy, stranger. Nice beast yer got here."
Said Cassie-May

"I may have an ointment to help with the smell..."
Said Crystal

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers eyes the dog warily, never quite sure with supernatural stuff

Alexander Hauswald shakes the hand, before looking at Cassie. There's an actual emotion on his face

now- even if you can tell what it is.

"Thank you. His name's Sacks."
Said Alexander

Wily Galen straightens up and removes his hat to scratch at a tattered mop of hair on top of his head. The

man does not appear to have eyes.

"Sacks? Aww. Who's a good boy?"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano leans down, looking at the dog.

"If you do not mind smelling like either a young girl or an engine, instead."
Said Crystal

"An' mah name's Cassie-May. Jus' call meh Cassie or Cas. Yew?"
Said Cassie-May

"I think I'll pass, but thanks for the offer."
Said Wily

"How do you see things? Do you? Is it hard?"
Said Crystal

"Mmmm?"
Said Wily

The dog stares at Nephi. You're not sure if he understands you, but he doesn't seem to

appreciate it too much.

Alexander Hauswald:

"Can you hide things in fake eyes in the sockets?"
Said Crystal

"I can still see."
Said Wily

"...Thaaasss a good boy."
Said Nephi

"Maybe not as a good as I used to, but I manage."
Said Wily

"Alexander. No nicknames."
Said Alexander

"Would putting fake eyes in the sockets impede your vision?"
Said Crystal

Nephi "Longiron" Delano gently pats the dog.

"Something to do with...magic or something else."
Said Wily

"Oh. I'm Nephi Delano. Most folks call me Longiron.Nephi "
Said Longiron

"I don't go in much for that."
Said Wily

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is wearing a weatherbeaten duster, obvious hand-me-down clothes, and two

rifles in scabbards on his back.

"So Alexander, how'd ya come ta be travelin' with... Sacks, was it? Yeah, with Sacks

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"Yer gunne have ta live wit' Alex, sugercube."
Said Cassie-May

Alexander Hauswald stays silent, nodding at Nephi in acknowledgement.

"...but you could sneak little tiny flasks wherever you went! You'd just have to make them

look like eyeballs!"

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Shucks, I think you're gonna fit in around here just fine."
Said Nephi

"..."
Said Wily

"... Fair enough."
Said he

"Walked with me from New York."

"Or diamonds, or small but important things!"
Said Crystal

Oh no. He's a YANKEE.Alexander Hauswald:

Wily Galen squints at Crystal with his sockets. It looks unsettling.

Crystal Saint Claire squints back with her cloudy eyes.

"New York? Mister Alexander, you gotta tell me!"
Said Nephi

"What was it like?"

"You're not a normal little girl are you?"
Said Wily

"I always wanted to visit New York!"
Said Nephi

"New York, ya say? An he ain't tried ta attack ya or nothin?"
Said Callie

"No, sir! I am most at home amongst abnormalities, to a degree."
Said Crystal

"Things I can study, and that cannot..."

Crystal Saint Claire trails off.

"There an, end to that sentence?"
Said Wily

"No sir."
Said Crystal

not that I pester, but... I pester :P(From Cassie-May O'Brien):

"I had one but it escaped."
Said Crystal

"Okey doke cattle poke."
Said Wily

"..."
Said Alexander

You seem to confuse him, as little as he shows it.

"New York's big. Too big."

can Cassie recognize Wily as undead much like the one she encountered before?(From Cassie-May O'Brien):

"...Oh."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano falls a little bit more quiet then sits down.

Oh yeah. It's pretty obvious he's not amongst the living.(To Cassie-May O'Brien):

The mutt, meanwhile, lies on his stomach, calmly judging you all.Alexander Hauswald:

"...'M kinda concerned 'bout th' other guy."
Said Cassie-May

"I am an engineer, sir! We are meant to ignore most oddities, unless dangerous!"
Said Crystal

Alexander Hauswald follows Nephi's steps, sitting down as well. "Got the letter too?"

"Sure did."
Said Nephi

"Ain' nothin' good comin' from folks like him."
Said Cassie-May

Nephi "Longiron" Delano flashes it from his duster pocket.

Crystal Saint Claire mods to herself

"What other guy?"
Said Nephi

"Is that so?"
Said Wily

"Sacks doesn't trust him. That says enough."
Said Alexander

Fucking autocorrectCrystal Saint Claire:

"Yes sir!"

"Th' undead one tha' wuz standin' 'round wit' Alex here?"
Said Cassie-May

"Oh, the-"
Said Nephi

"Being an engineer must be interesting work."
Said Wily

Nephi "Longiron" Delano frowns.

"...Ain't no such thing as undead."
Said Nephi

"I graduated from MIT last year!"
Said Crystal

"..."
Said Alexander

"It has been interesting thus far!"
Said Crystal

Alexander Hauswald looks at Nephi, lifting a brow.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano says, more as if to reassure himself than anyone else.

"Sure there are."
Said Alexander

Wily Galen throws one arm back and braces himself on the bed of the sleeper compartment as he adopts

a relaxed lean.

"...Not around the Ranger..."
Said He

Cassie-May O'Brien stared flatly at Nephi while taking a sip of coffee.

"Sure them are. Dead but nawt done, them are. Met 'em before. Bad news, the lot."
Said Cassie-May

"What happens up at oven MIT?"
Said Wily

"I got a letter recently giving me an excuse to leave Colorado, so I did."
Said Crystal

"...Ranger?"
Said Alexander

"Mostly education."
Said Crystal

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks over towards Callie.

"Never got much of that."
Said Wily

"...Why nawt?"
Said Cassie-May

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers chuckles. "Ya really think Ah didn't guess y'azll knew there were?"

"..."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald rubs the back of his neck.

"I remember a few odd classes in demonology they required we take. Something about

being able to rebut arguments that Ghost Rock was the soul of the innocents and such."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"...No, Sacks. I'm not telling anyone. Stay silent."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald looks at the dog, seemingly conversing with him.

"So, you're telling me it's not congealed soul juice?"
Said Wily

((Also hi, Yupster))Alexander Hauswald:

"...Miss Callie's the only law dog here."
Said Nephi

"Welp, guess we're all on th' same page, 'side from mistah sharpshootah there."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien motioned at Nephi.

"An' long as none of y'all take a shot at me, we're gonna get along jus' fine."
Said Callie

"Not even t'keep a secret?"
Said Nephi

"No sir. Ghost Rock is a silly name. It is simply a porous form of coal containing densities

Crystal Saint Claire:

"That works for me."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano frowns.

"Well, could have fooled me."
Said Wily

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers smirks. "Now if ya sing 'Dixie' fer me, Ah might jus' deputize ya too."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano hmmphs!

"..."
Said Crystal

"Don't need to. Thank you."
Said Alexander

change meh in two hours?"

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"...An'. fer the record, where's he?"

"We're taking watches now?"
Said Nephi

"Are you tired? I can go back to my fort..."
Said Crystal

"He's not dangerous."
Said Alexander

There was a knock upon the door AlexanderWhitney G. Elieen:

"...An' Crystal? An' our amazon nun?"
Said Cassie-May

"I could use a nap, but it's not essential anymore."
Said Wily

"Annoying, yes. Not Dangerous."
Said Alexander

"....Amazon nun?"

"...Sounds like her now."
Said Nephi

"I like to close my eyes and not think about things for a while."
Said Wily

"Eeeeyup. C'mere in, Whitney!"
Said Cassie-May

"Can't quite sleep right anymore."
Said Wily

"That's as close as I can get."

The door opens...Whitney G. Elieen:

"I have been trying to eat better about sleeping. Whitney lets me sleep with her."
Said Crystal

(giggity)Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"It saves a bed, and I get cold easily. "
Said Crystal

And in steps an incredibly large woman. Her body hunched over ever so slightly so as not to

hit the celling. A thick set of blond hair atop sparkling blue eyes and an almost impossibly beautiful smile.

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Makes sense."
Said Wily

"Good evening all of you...I have returned from my evening exercises."
Said Whitney

"Might do that if anyone ever wanted to bunk up with me these days."
Said Wily

"Hey miss Eileen."
Said Hes

"Only one I know of that might do it is Billy."
Said Wily

"And I see the lord has graced us with even more company!"
Said Whitney

"Sure did."
Said Nephi

"He's been off for..."
Said Wily

"Couple weeks now?"

Wily Galen strokes an imaginary length of beard with his free hand.

"Have you considered warm, slightly damp blankets? The feel is similar to human

Crystal Saint Claire:

Alexander Hauswald just stares a the massive nun, confused. One hand slowly reached to hold an

absolutely terrified Sacks.

"...Hello."
Said Alexander

"Warm and damp don't go together too well when you're trying not to rot."
Said Wily

"I prefer not to make whatever's keeping me like this too hard."

Cassie-May O'Brien sipped her coffee, grinning and watching the scene so far.

"Do not be frightened...no good soul should ever live in fear of a servant of the lord."
Said Whitney

"Whitney Gould Elieen. I am blessed to meet you two."

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers chuckles as she leans back and lights a cigar

"Than perhaps a heated stone?"
Said Crystal

"She's a good one, Mister Alexander. No need to stand on a-flutter!"
Said Nephi

"...Alexander Hauswald." He says eventually, offering his hand to Whitney, pointing at the

mongrel in the other hand. "This is Sacks."

Alexander Hauswald:

A pot full of rocks, boiled and dried, would likely be free of microbial life."Crystal Saint Claire:

"That's better."
Said Wily

"Nephi, Callie, y'all saw Crystal anywhere?"
Said Cassie-May

Whitney G. Elieen reaches forward and grips it with a smile. Her grip is firm. There was a great deal of

strength there...

"Alexander and Sacks. I shall say a prayer for the both of you."
Said Whitney

"She ran off somewhere."
Said Nephi

"Uhh... think she followed the corpse."
Said Callie

Alexander Hauswald just shakes it, his face betraying a hint of uneasiness.

"...Thank you."
Said Alexander

"...He ain't a corpse."
Said Nephi

"To thank the lord that he brought you with us...I assume you as well are answering the call of

the Marshall?"

Whitney G. Elieen:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano grumbles.

"A corpse you say...?"
Said Whitney

Alexander Hauswald nods. "Everyone here got the letter?"

"Yup."
Said Nephi

Alexander Hauswald seems to connect the dots.

"He's a leper."
Said Alexander

"Not a corpse."

"...See, now that's something that's not crazy talk."
Said Nephi

Cassie-May O'Brien tensed up. She moved the coffee mug to the left hand and rested her right on her

"Crystal? Y'all okay there?"
Said Cassie-May

Crystal Saint Claire leans out a door.

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers goes out the door, watching Cassie, her own hand on the handle of her revolver

Wily Galen pokes his head out of the door above the shorter Crystal.

"Yes, though I think I may be bothering my new mortially challenged friend."
Said Crystal

"A leper...an ancient and most wretched disease."
Said Whitney

"Jesus healed the lepers, didn't he, miss Eileen?"
Said Nephi

"Shit, is there a leper on the train?"
Said Wily

"Cruel as sin to the afflicted. Whomever your friend is I shall say a prayer for him."
Said Whitney

"Not a friend."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald shrugs.

"Through the power of God Nephi nothing is impossible."
Said Whitney

"Y'all don't look like no leper to me, sugercube."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien stared intensely at Wily.

"Undead, though, eeyup."
Said Cassie-May

"Mortially challenged."
Said Crystal

"I prefer dead."
Said Wily

"Potayto, potahto."
Said Cassie-May

"Five dollar words were never my strong suit."
Said Wily

"Hands where Ah can see 'em."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Nephi

"Let them deal with it."

"It means you were bad at dying sir."
Said Crystal

"Whatever it is. Leper or no."
Said Nephi

"Or you'll fill me full of lead?"
Said Wily

Nephi "Longiron" Delano pulls his hat down over his eyes.

Alexander Hauswald just sighs, facepalming.

"On a train."
Said Wily

"Please do not shoot him."
Said Crystal

"What're you good at, mister Alexander?"
Said Nephi

"Right after I've had a pleasant conversation with Miss Crystal?"
Said Wily

"No, Sacks. Not until they do something dumb."
Said Alexander

"I would rather not bury anyone tonight."
Said Crystal

"Ain' one to make the first shot, stranger, but Ah know yer kind. Don'cha cause no trouble

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers steps forward and flashes her badge. "Teas Ranger. Ya got a good hold on that

manitou in yer head?"

"And digging two holes is difficult at my size."
Said Crystal

"Wasn't planning on it."
Said Wily

"I was just catching a ride back to Kansas city."

Alexander Hauswald looks up at Nephi. "Shooting. Tracking. Treating animals. Know a thing or two about

occult things."

"Ye better."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien nodded and sipped her coffee.

"Oh! We're headed to Kansas City!"
Said Crystal

"You and everybody else on this train, apparently."
Said Nephi

"Fer erryun' involved."
Said Cassie-May

"The Divine will at work~"
Said Whitney

"He has delivered unto us the gift of company."

"God's got better things to do."
Said Alexander

"Please stop launching about with threats. Be clear. Be concise."
Said Crystal

"Well, nice to meet you too Miss itchy trigger finger."
Said Wily

"God always has time for his children."
Said She

"I'm gonna go take a nap, unless you want to have a jaw?"
Said Wily

"Something like 'You will be shot if you become an issue's would suffice here."
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien spat on the ground and moved her hand off her revolver.

Issue's *Crystal Saint Claire:

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers nods to the Harrowed. "Jus' know that if any trouble starts brewin' Ah'll be on

ya faster'n ya can blink."

"Tha's whut Ah said."
Said Cassie-May

"Well, we three seem to be the only sane ones on the train right now."
Said Nephi

"...Benefit of doubt, people."
Said Alexander

"He didn't do nothing."

"That is what you implied. Implications are for those unwilling to face the consequences of

following through on a proper threat, ma'am."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Jumpin at... First guy comes on smelling of cabbages and they all jump up and start

yammering about walkin dead."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Alexander Hauswald shoots a dirty glare at Sacks."

"That is what I was taught in Psychology, anyway."
Said Crystal

"Buncha wackos."
Said Nephi

Cassie-May O'Brien sipped at her coffee.

doin' mischief, Ah ain' gunne have no problem puttin' yer in th' ground fer good. Tha' better?"

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Wily Galen draws his head back into the sleeper compartment nice and slow. He takes quiet steps over to

the bed and curls up on the edge of it. The two suitcases afford him little room, but he doesn't seem to

"Wacko adventurer, a reb, and a scientist."
Said Nephi

Crystal Saint Claire scribbles something in her small, leather bound journal.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano grumbles.

"I think he understood the first time. My correction was for future instances."
Said Crystal

"Y'all talk too much."
Said Cassie-May

"...I should likely sleep soon... Have any of you seen Whitney?"
Said Crystal

"Yeah, she's back with us."
Said Callie

"Back wit' th' others."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien thumbed over her shoulder.

"...We're gonna get along fine.Alexander Hauswald:

Sacks likes most of you."

"Well that's great to hear!"
Said Nephi

"He's a good dog. Love dogs."

"Had a golden retriever back home."

"...What kinda breed is he? Sacks, I mean."

Crystal Saint Claire runs off to find Whitney for bedtime!

Crystal Saint Claire knocks on the for to the compartment.

Whitney G. Elieen goes to open the door

"Crystal...welcome sister!"
Said Whitney

Alexander Hauswald shrugs. "No idea. Probably a mongrel."

"Tell me do you know the hour?"
Said Whitney

"Whitney!"
Said Crystal

"...No, Sacks. Your word isn't good enough."
Said Alexander

"Well, Mongrel dogs are the really smart ones, y'know."
Said Nephi

Crystal Saint Claire hugs Whitney. She reaches MAYBE the larger woman's hip.

"Nick your wallet while you're sleeping, they will."
Said Nephi

"Is it bedtime yet?"
Said Crystal

"Go on a vacation to Miami."
Said Nephi

"Not this one. Used to be dumber than a sack of hammers."
Said Alexander

Whitney G. Elieen returns the hug with as much strength as she could without crushing the poor young

"Right you are! Tomorrow we shall arise bright and early."
Said Whitney

"I enjoy my mornings with you very much after all."

Crystal Saint Claire nods.

"You are a good listener."
Said Crystal

"We gotta be in Kansas by now anyways."
Said Nephi

"We got a day or two."
Said Alexander

"Tell me then. Are you ready to go to bed now? And have you had a chance to say hello to

our new friend?"

Whitney G. Elieen:

Cassie-May O'Brien peeked her head into the compartment where the undead went to sleep in.

"I'll go sleep. Let's go, Sacks."
Said Alexander

Wily Galen one arm is hanging off the bed. His bowler hat fell off during the transition from floor to bed.

Galen looks like a disheveled corpse. He is a disheveled corpse in most anyone's eyes.

Cassie-May O'Brien furrowed her brow and pulled back, leaning on the wall in the corridor, observing the

partially-opened door and sipping coffee from her mug in left hand, right hand resting on the grip of her

Alexander Hauswald passes by Cassie, stopping briefly to look at the scene.

Wily Galen reaches one hand behind himself and scratches at the seat of his pants.

"If he wanted, he'd do something."
Said Alexander

"No use eyeballing him."

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers puts a hand on Cassie's shoulder. "Ah'll take second watch."

"...You do know I can hear you assholes standing at my door, right?"
Said Wily

"Jus' doin' my job."
Said Callie

"Can you close the door so it's harder to hear you badmouthing me?"
Said Wily

Cassie-May O'Brien nodded at Callie.

"Ain' takin' no chances."
Said Cassie-May

"...You sure, Sacks? Well, no use changing your mind."
Said Alexander

the dog sits down next to this commotion, ever vigilant.

"Sacks said he'll take watch."

Rangers. Jus'... the things in yer heads can be... unpredicatable... is all."

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Alexander Hauswald just shrugs, going to find his own place to sleep in.

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers nods and goes to catch some sleep before her shift

Wily Galen turns over and rearranges himself on top of his bed.

(Also the dog is still sitting there. MENACINGLY)Alexander Hauswald:

Cassie-May O'Brien just stays there with her gun and coffee.

Is there anything else you dudes wanna do?

Nothing on my side!Cassie-May O'Brien:

Destroy the train?Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

Wonderful Cowboy Land slaps Callie through the fourth wall.

Quit dat shit.

No.

I need the train.

Maybe play on Galen's ribs like a xylophoneAlexander Hauswald:

The train starts up again once the Conductor is reasonably certain everyone has

gotten aboard and settled back down.

This was fun!Alexander Hauswald:

Anyone here? Doc?000

Then I will be back.

The train to Kansas is rolling along smooth as silk across a long stretch of desert land.

Most everyone is in the seated portion of the train. Reginald is in his cabin snoozing still. The vitally challenged

Whitney G. Elieen has her head bowed low. Perhaps in prayer. Perhaps in rest. Try as she might poor

Crystal was squeezed in a little tight.

Poage seemed satisfied, asleep in Whitney's bed. She slept the kind of sleep one experiences after a long

Crystal Saint Claire *

Alexander Hauswald is tending to Sacks, his face filled with gruffness as he tries to readjust the canine's

Crystal Saint Claire is hugging Whitney's arm like a lamppost, mumbling nonsense in her sleep.

In particular, a few thing deepest.Crystal Saint Claire:

But y'all don't care about that flummery. S'just sleeptalkin'!

(Oh my gosh you gave Sacks his own icon)Alexander Hauswald:

The train goes over a fair to middling size bump in the tracks. It disturbs stomachs and

some small mugs of coffee. Sacks crawls out from under the table where he was resting and begins to stretch.

Alexander Hauswald absentmindedly pets him, lost in thought.

Sacks does a big doggie yawn that ends with him smacking his lips.

Sacks barks something that Alexander can't quite interpret. Doggo probably wants

more pets pardner.

Whitney G. Elieen breaths shallow, restful breaths as Crystal hangs on her arms as tight as a sleeping girl

can muster. The giantess's eyes were closed. Her expression one of absolute serenity.

Sacks takes a few steps towards the giant nun, looking at her with mild terror. He's trying to sniff in her

direction from afar, confused.

Whitney G. Elieen 's left eye slowly opens

Sacks makes an alarmed step back!

Whitney G. Elieen smiles

Whitney G. Elieen puts a finger to her lips as she motions her head towards the sleeping Crystal.

Sacks 's ears flatten as he nods, slooooowly making his way back to Alexander. And hiding under his

Whitney G. Elieen closes her eyes again

Whitney G. Elieen takes a deep breath

Just opened the game not to forget later

Nevermore is also here

Crystal Saint Claire shifts in Whitney's arms as the train bumps, making a noise halfway between a groan

and a yawn before settling back down.

I'm on mobiileCrystal Saint Claire:

One minute

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has started tapping his foot in impatience.

"Feels like we've been on this train for the hairy edge of forever."
Said Nephi

"Any minute now."
Said Alexander

"That's what I keep saying!"
Said Nephi

"Give it time. Might be an hour. Might be longer."
Said Alexander

"...Fff."
Said Nephi

"...Y'got a deck of cards, Mister Alex?"

Whitney G. Elieen stays nice, steady and silent through it all. Giving the poor girl someone to lean on

through this bumpy, largely uncomfortable train ride.

"Don't play cards."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald shrugs.

The textures are low quality cuz that's the way they came.

"Got no luck."
Said Alexander

"Really? I always liked cards."
Said Nephi

"Ma taught me how to play poker for chores. Fun way to pass the time when there's eight ways for them to be

"Brother used to play a lot."
Said Alexander

"Never was any good. I always ended up having to do the sweeping."
Said Nephi

"Stopped when the debts started piling up."
Said Alexander

"See, that's why I never play for money. I like to play for bullets. Got plenty of those."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano jangles the vest he wears under his duster. Jingle jangle goes the bullets stuffed

into every single possible pocket with more added on besides.

"..."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald looks at him.

"...What?"
Said Nephi

"Stay away from fire."
Said Alexander

"S'not a sin if it's not money."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano sits, satisfied with his cleverness.

"Too much gunpowder on one person."
Said Alexander

"You'll explode the second someone lights a cigar."

"I gotta carry all this though. That gatlin' rifle I got? Chews through bullets like

nobody's business."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"You got any of those newfangled shootin irons, mister Alexander?"

Alexander Hauswald , in response, pulls out a Colt Army revolver.

"That answers it?"
Said Alexander

"Ooh. You customize it?"
Said Nephi

"...I don't need customizing."
Said Alexander

"Everybody needs some customizing! What good's havin a special gun if everybody

don't know about it?"

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"I don't need customizing."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald slides the gun back into the holster, giving it a little pat.

"Don'tcha want to be famous?"
Said Nephi

"Figgure that's half the reason most folks head out West to begin with."

"I got bigger fish to fry than fame."
Said Alexander

"What bigger fish is there to fry?"
Said Nephi

"Finding my brother."
Said Alexander

"...Dangit, man, now I'm thinkin about fried fish."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano then realizes what Alex said.

"...He's missin?"
Said Nephi

"I'd be happy to keep an eye out for 'im if I see im."

The map.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Not on me."
Said Alexander

The train on the map.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

It's really low resolution.

Poage has no vision

...

Crystal Saint Claire is only MOSTLY blind

"He's not missing. He's kidnapped."
Said Alexander

"..."
Said Nephi

"By... by who?"

Nephi "Longiron" Delano shifts a little more nervously, worrying that the same thing might happen to his

"Soon-to-be-dead people."
Said Alexander

"Sounds about right. Kidnappin' ain't right."
Said Nephi

big white skinned fella(To Alexander Hauswald):

"There's gotta be a better way than murder though."
Said Nephi

"And water's wet."
Said Alexander

"Every man's got a chance at redemption, after all."
Said Nephi

"Not this one."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks to Alex with a worried expression.

"...Iffn you say so."
Said Nephi

Can you see now?(To Poage):

Yes(From Crystal Saint Claire):

Crystal Saint Claire snugs up against Whitney, mumbling something about the river

"I don't care why or for what reason. He's a dead man one way or the other."
Said Alexander

"...Reason's real important. You do the right thing for the wrong reasons, it's still a

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Alexander Hauswald looks at Nephi, sighing.

"I'll go to hell happy."
Said Alexander

"..."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano leans back in his seat.

"First thing i'm doin when I get to Kansas City is buyin' a deck of cards."
Said Nephi

Can I make the Huckster pack of cards materialize?(From Alexander Hauswald):

"Might have a pack."
Said Alexander

You may materialize a pack of cards.(To UrbanCritter):

Gonna look like sleight of hand.(To UrbanCritter):

Alexander Hauswald reaches for his pocket...

Anything I gotta roll?(From Alexander Hauswald):

(test)Crystal Saint Claire:

(I can see it)Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

You're fine. This is a not stressful situation and making a pack of cards show up is pretty

(To UrbanCritter):

Nephi "Longiron" Delano pulls out a pocket watch and checks the time.

"Hmmmh."
Said Nephi

Alexander Hauswald ...and pulls out a deck of cards, shuffling them.

"Ay, see? I knew you'd have one!"
Said Nephi

"Looks like I did."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald keeps shuffling it. "Poker?"

"Sure thing."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano takes off one of his belt pouches and puts it on the table.

"We'll just play for fun, yeah?"
Said Nephi

"No money to burn. Still need to buy Sacks his lunch."
Said Alexander

"I got..."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano reaches into a belt pouch right in front of another kind of package and pulls out

a thick wad of cash and some coins.

Sacks looks at Alexander with his best puppy dog eyes at the mention of lunch.

"...About... $80 union, and..."
Said Nephi

"Some Reb odds and ends."

"Think they'll take union cash here."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald turns to Sacks.

"You just had breakfast."
Said Alexander

"Probably not."
Said Nephi

"But there'll probably be a bank that'll do exchanges."
Said Nephi

It means that Cassie had to sleep, yes?(From dimVitrarius):

After you picked up Alexander and the walking stiff? Yes.(To dimVitrarius):

Also yes.(To dimVitrarius):

I think we should make the nightmares roll, then! ..and sort out the Fate Chips.(From dimVitrarius):

"Probably. Heard from someone gold's worth the same everywhere."
Said Alexander

"Why I keep most of the rest in coins."
Said Nephi

"Gold's gold."

"Ghost Rock's bad."
Said Alexander

"Sacks doesn't like it."

Alrighty roo. Make the nightmare roll and we'll sort out fate chips after we resolve that.(To dimVitrarius):

"What's the problem with Ghost Rock? It's just really good coal."
Said Nephi

"Not according to Sacks."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald idly pets the dog.

"No idea what it is, but it's bad."
Said Alexander

You can roll it in the main chat or gmroll it. Your pick.(To dimVitrarius):

"He's just a silly ol'dog, that's what he is."
Said Nephi

Sacks doesn't even bother growling. He just gives Nephi a long, disapproving look.

"Ghost Rock's the only thing that keeps Salt Lake running. All the Saints woulda been

rattler food without it."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Cassie-May O'Brien stirred in her dead log sleep.

"Mnnnuuuugh..."
Said Cassie-May

((Kingdom Hearts One???))Alexander Hauswald:

Help explain rolling to me(From Whitney G. Elieen):

I think it's...Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

There we go

Like that

I have no idea what I am doing lol(From Whitney G. Elieen):

"Bad things still do good."
Said Alexander

Hell if I know right now, we'll figure it out when the time comes.(To Yuppie b.):

"True."
Said Nephi

Mostly just roll how many dice of how many sides and keep the highest number.(To Yuppie b.):

Cassie-May O'Brien woke up with a start, sitting up in panic with bloodshot eyes and hand on her

revolver. She blinked and rubbed her face with both hands after a second.

"...Uuuuuuuughhh..."
Said Cassie-May

"Ey!"
Said Nephi

"Y'kiss your mother with that mouth?"

"And yours too."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano frowns.

Cassie-May O'Brien stood up, scratching her head with a scowl.

Alexander Hauswald stifles a snicker.

Sick burn Nephi, are you going to take that?

"...Coffee. Must... coffee. No talky to Cassie."
Said Cassie-May

"Well yer a..."
Said Nephi

"Dern it."

"Don't."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano grumps back into his seat.

Cassie-May O'Brien waved at Nephi with one hand, rubbing her face with the other, apparently still trying

to get her bearings.

Nephi's momma raised a polite boy, perhaps polite to a fault.

Whitney G. Elieen opens her eyes slowly

"Sassy-livered blinkspot..."
Said Nephi

Whitney G. Elieen gives Crystal a little shake. "Rise sister...it is getting close to our time."

Cassie-May O'Brien slaps herself and groans, then looks around for means to make herself coffee.

Nephi mumbles under his breath.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

I'm gonna try to use Riducule mostly deadpan-style(From Crystal Saint Claire):

"...Deadman's probably up."
Said Alexander

Cassie-May O'Brien stumbles past Alexander in direction of the restaurant wagon.

"Maybe he got off the train, if we're lucky."
Said Nephi

"So nobody's gotta deal with it anymore."

"Him."
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien is gone for a moment.

Crystal Saint Claire squirms a little, getting comfy.

"Hmmm?"
Said Whitney

Cassie-May O'Brien returns with a sour expression and a steaming mug of coffee.

"Mmmiss Eileen? Miss Crystal? Yew two awake?"
Said Nephi

"Mornin'."
Said Cassie-May

Crystal Saint Claire nods.

Whitney G. Elieen says as she removes her arm from Crystal's grasp, only to put it over her shoulder

Cassie-May O'Brien siiiips.

Whitney G. Elieen squeezes

"Mornin."
Said Nephi

"Would anyone like breakfast?"
Said Crystal

"Good morning."
Said Alexander

"Yes we are awake."
Said Whitney

"Already had some."
Said Nephi

"Yew two slept in."

"Breakfast sounds good."
Said Cassie-May

Alexander Hauswald perks up, barking loudly at the idea of breakfast!

((That was Sacks))Alexander Hauswald:

"Urgh..."
Said Cassie-May

((SAAAAACKS))Alexander Hauswald:

Sacks perks up, barking loudly at the idea of breakfast!

"...I was up late last night..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire leans against Whitney.

"Sorry..."
Said Crystal

"Could go for breakfast."
Said Alexander

"I know I am supposed to go to sleep no later than ten but I was ocupied..."
Said Crystal

"...Maybe I'm a mite hungry too."
Said Nephi

"Up workin' all night?"

"Poking the deadman?"
Said Alexander

"Can we lay off this whole deadman business?"
Said Nephi

"What's makin' yer so sour 'bout it?"
Said Cassie-May

"It ain't right to go discussin such things."
Said Nephi

"Yellin' accusations."

"Y'all been botherin the poor fella so much!"

"He has no eyes."
Said Alexander

"It ain' right to keep walkin' after goin' six feet under either."
Said Cassie-May

"Seen lotsa folk with no eyes too."
Said Nephi

"Most of'em are kind enough to wear eyepatches, but..."

"Both eyes?"
Said Alexander

"I had a discussion with the mortially challenged passenger. Then I barricaded myself in the

room. Then I found Whitney and slept with her."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Heh heh...I thank you for your honesty. It matters not that you fall...but that you arise anew"
Said Whitney

"Yew would look mighty silly with two eyepatches, wouldn't ya?"
Said Nephi

(brb)Whitney G. Elieen:

"Sacks says he smells like death."
Said Alexander

and backWhitney G. Elieen:

"So did my friend Hardin. He just ate lotsa cabbages."
Said Nephi

"No. Actual death."
Said Alexander

"He's rotting."

"Same thing, far as I'm concerned."
Said Nephi

"...Whatever helps you sleep."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald stands up, groaning.

"I am so sorry...do you need to get up for breakfast sister?"
Said Whitney

"I apologize in the name of the holy if I am blocking your path"

"Do you need some assistance?"

"...Coulda go fer some bacon an' eggs, fellas. Y'all gonna go wit' me to the grub wagon?"
Said Cassie-May

"I-it is fine, Whitney! I will just... go wtih you, to breakfast. When you are ready. I am not

particularly hungry, but I sometimes forget to eat, so it is best to try to remain on a schedule..."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"I'll come with. Sacks, you coming?"
Said Alexander

Sacks barks eagerly!

"I am not hungry...but if you like you can accompany the others. Our fine friend Cassie is

headed that way. Say the word sister and I shall make your path clear."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Thought so."
Said Alexander

Whitney G. Elieen squeezes

"If y'all forgettin' ta eat, Crystal, then yer bettah come wit' us."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire is still holding tight to Whitney

"Ye can take yer Mormon teddybear wit'cha."
Said Cassie-May

Whitney G. Elieen grabs

Whitney G. Elieen hoists Crystal up along with herself

"She is not Mormon."
Said Crystal

"She is-- eep!"

Whitney G. Elieen sets her down gently on the ground

"Adventist actually"
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen says with a smile

"Oh? Mah bad then, pardnah - ain' meant no offence."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien tipped her Stetson in an apology.

"We going?"
Said Alexander

"Sacks' getting anxious."

"No offense taken. Thank you for your consideration."
Said Whitney

"While Ah'm handin' out apologies."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien turned to Nephi.

"Sawrry, pardnah. Ah git real cranky in them mornings until Ah can git mah cuppa joe."
Said Cassie-May

Crystal Saint Claire holds onto Whitney's hand, trying to pull her along. She might as well be tugging a

The back door of the train shudders open and a familiar face appears. The Conductor

shoves a rattling metal trolley through the door. It jounces a little on the door jamb, but the covered plate and the

large pitcher of coffee stay relatively still.

"Coffee!"
Said Cassie-May

"...Guess it's coming to us."
Said Alexander

Cassie-May O'Brien quickly downed remaining half of her mug and extended the empty container to the

"Fill meh up, sugercube."
Said Cassie-May

"Look, I don't have anything else to do but make you guys as comfortable as possible."
Said Conductor

"Alexander Hauswald:

"...Drive the train?"

"The train goes back, and forth, and sometimes it changes tracks."
Said Crystal

Conductor squeezes around the trolley, grabbing the coffee pitcher as he does. He obliges Cassie and

fills her mug back up full of steamy black goodness.

" The lord has delivered unto us a bounty it seems."
Said Whitney

"Really, if it needs to stop suddenly, that is what the conductor is for, no?"
Said Crystal

"Ohh, yer a godsend. If y'all say yer got some breakfast on this trolley here..."
Said Cassie-May

"Is there anything sweet?"
Said Crystal

"Eggs, bacon, toast, beans, ketchup, and salt."
Said Conductor

"Think there might be a few toasted apples in there."

"Gimme."
Said Cassie-May

"How much is there?"
Said Alexander

Cassie-May O'Brien took a seat with a grin.

"Beans and water will do just fine for me."
Said Whitney

"I hope it's enough for all of you."
Said Conductor

"Ah'm takin' full course. Girl's gotta eat!"
Said Cassie-May

Conductor takes a few plates out from under the cart and begins distributing the food accordingly.

"Toast and eggs. Sacks'll have beans and bacon."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald glares at the dog.

"One of these days I'm going to get some help."
Said Conductor

"No, I'm not going to ask if the beans are organic."
Said Alexander

"...Yer whut."
Said Cassie-May

Conductor finishes piling up a few plates and glasses. Then he gives Alexander a look.

Alexander Hauswald takes a step forward to help the conductor.

"Th' fuck is organic?"
Said Conductor

"I don't know."
Said Alexander

"But Sacks wants it."

"That's the dog right?"
Said Conductor

Alexander Hauswald nods.

"He's a picky eater."
Said Alexander

Conductor grabs the plates and walks up the length of the train car, doling out the ordered food and drink.

Cassie-May O'Brien rolled her eyes with mouth full of beans and bacon and eggs.

Crystal Saint Claire takes toast and beans and ketchup and a toasted apple!

Alexander Hauswald sets Sacks' plate next to him, and starts eating his own.

Sacks sniffs curiously at his plate. Before starting to nibble at the bacon.

Conductor walks up to Crystal and gives her a plate. Then he hands Whitney a plate full of beans

accompanied by a cool, clear glass of water.

Whitney G. Elieen takes a simple bowl of beans and water herself

"Mind if I squeeze past you two?"
Said Conductor

Nephi "Longiron" Delano also got breakfast and is having plenty of munch along the way

"Oh! I apopogize..."
Said Crystal

"Nephi, y'all fergive meh or nawt?"
Said Cassie-May

Crystal Saint Claire wriggles back past Whitney with her food

"Thanks, there might be a rough patch coming up soon."
Said Conductor

Crystal Saint Claire eats methodically, a small spoonful of beans being placed on a small bite of toast.

The apple is being saved for last.Crystal Saint Claire:

Whitney G. Elieen eats her simple meal as slowly as she could. A few bites of beans followed by a sip of

"Yeah, yeah. I fergive ya."
Said Nephi

"Don't know if they cleared out the riff raff that was hanging around here last time I came through."
Said Conductor

Crystal Saint Claire also tries to drink as much water as she can! Hydration is important!

"Gewd."
Said Cassie-May

Nephi "Longiron" Delano drops back into one of the seats.

Cassie-May O'Brien gulps a mouthful of beans.

"Riffraff?"
Said Cassie-May

Alexander Hauswald stops chewing, looking at the conductor.

"Folks who don't have anything better to do than hang around and shoot shit."
Said Conductor

"Tha' much Ah reckon, jus' how much an' how well armed?"
Said Cassie-May

"Have you considered getting security?"
Said Crystal

"...Got a feeling we're security."
Said Alexander

"We're security."
Said Cassie-May

"Cheap pistols last time I came around. Though that has been a while."
Said Conductor

Cassie-May O'Brien grinned at Alexander.

"...I have signed no such contract"
Said Crystal

"Y'all agreed to a bullet in yer gut?"
Said Cassie-May

Alexander Hauswald has the barest hint of a smile back at Cassie.

"We're marshals. Oriented or not."
Said Alexander

Conductor lopes up the train and passes through a car door. It shuts behind him with a metallic clack.

"I am not of the mercenary persuasion"
Said Crystal

"Well someone's gotta keep us in good nick, right?Nephi "
Said Longiron

"Ain' answerin' mah question."
Said Cassie-May

"That's probably yer job, miss Crystal."
Said Nephi

"Please word your question in a more comprehensible fashion, then."
Said Crystal

"Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid of them for the lord your God goes with you; and

he will not forsake you."

Whitney G. Elieen:

Cassie-May O'Brien quickly finished up her monster of a breakfast, belched into her fist, finished her

"God is with me...whatever could I fear of man and his foolishness?"
Said Whitney

Crystal Saint Claire digs into her carpet bag and pulls out a pistol and two little pouches.

Cassie-May O'Brien makes sure her Winchester, double-barrel and revolver are all loaded and ready.

"Who here is good wth pistols?"
Said Crystal

"I am."
Said Cassie-May

Alexander Hauswald lifts a hand.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano just keeps having food.

"...Not bad for a train breakfast."
Said Nephi

"Does anyone here have any stupid superstiotions revolving Ghost Rock?"
Said Crystal

Alexander Hauswald points at Sacks.

"...A superstition is not a dog."
Said Crystal

"You asked."
Said Alexander

"He says the dog's superstitious."
Said Nephi

"Sacks doesn't like Ghost Rock."
Said Alexander

Cassie-May O'Brien puts her revolver and shotgun in their respective holsters, and leans on the wall with

her Winchester rifle at the ready.

"Ah."
Said Crystal

"...Never heard of a superstitious dog in my life, tho."
Said Nephi

(be back in a tick.)Conductor:

"Then Ghost Steel would likely be an issue for him as well?"
Said Crystal

Alexander Hauswald pulls his sixshooter out.

Sacks makes a silent whine.

"I think he'll manage."
Said Alexander

Crystal Saint Claire is holding a very strange gun.

"Whuzzat?"
Said Cassie-May

"This is a gun."
Said Crystal

"I cal it my Opus Magnum!"

Nephi "Longiron" Delano stifles a snicker.

"... That's not a gun."
Said Alexander

"...Awrigh', how's it speshul?"
Said Cassie-May

"It is a variant of the Lemat Grapeshot Pistol, made of Ghost Steel."
Said Crystal

"As such, it is lighter, more durable..."

"...You made a ghost shotgun."
Said Alexander

"...Huh. Nifty, sugercube."
Said Cassie-May

"Yeah?"
Said Alexander

"And capable of loading rounds with a higher powder-to-not-powder ratio. That is not a

technical term."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Also it has two settings. the pistol setting is a nine-shot revolver."

"Since our Texas Ranger an' Nephi are content wit' sittin' 'round here, how 'bout we go take

posishun on th' other end of th' car there?"

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"And the shotgun is single-shot."
Said Crystal

"Ey!"
Said Nephi

"...A curious contraption Crystal. A modern weapon if I ever did see one."
Said Whitney

Crystal Saint Claire beams.

"Sure thing. Sacks, you coming?"
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano gripes some more before finishing second breakfast.

"Bark bark!"
Said Sacks

"I made it in case bad things happened and I needed to defend myself against monsters!"
Said Crystal

"He's coming."
Said Alexander

"Big guns hurt them, but I cannot aim them very well."
Said Crystal

"...Faaahne, I'm coming too."
Said Nephi

"Right, so us two here, you two there..."
Said Cassie-May

"This is much lighter without sacrificing power!"
Said Crystal

Nephi "Longiron" Delano leaves his plate for the Conductor to clean up.

"A mighty tool indeed"
Said Whitney

"...An' Crystal in th' middle?"
Said Cassie-May

"A great weapon against all that which is evil"
Said Whitney

"..."
Said Cassie-May

"...they would likely be seeking baluables."
Said Crystal

"........"
Said Cassie-May

"Nephi, why the heck are ye groupin' up here too?"
Said Cassie-May

"I shall rest easy it seems. Though I can only pray we have no need of such a thing soon."
Said Whitney

"If we're testin guns, I wanna see."
Said Nephi

"Perhaps we should station a person or two in the luggage car?"
Said Crystal

"Thought Ah wuz clear. Two shootas on th' one end of th' car, two on th' other."
Said Cassie-May

"Tactics an' all."

(two seconds, getting coffee)Alexander Hauswald:

"If they are bandits they are not out to kill."
Said Crystal

"Darn your tactics. I got this covered."
Said Nephi

Alexander Hauswald draws his sixshooter.

"They are out to make a profit."
Said Crystal

"Ah only got lead an' cusses ta give."
Said Cassie-May

"But what about... hmm..."
Said Crystal

"You can say that again, foul-mouth!"
Said Nephi

"Whitney, y'all got any shootin' iron?"
Said Cassie-May

"Any horses passengers brought with us could be stolen and sold, along with weapons or

luggage. Clothing especially, or anything else like that."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"I do not no."
Said Whitney

"...I might have a metal pole you could use.Crystal Saint Claire:

"I carry no weapons of man upon me."
Said Whitney

"Y'all better take cover then if it comes to shootin'."
Said Cassie-May

"But a pole will suffice."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen smiles

Crystal Saint Claire digs through the carpet bag

Crystal Saint Claire pulls out a piece of metal pipe about two feet long.

"Be strong and courageous, do not fear or be dismayed because of the king of Assyria nor

because of all the horde that is with him; for the one with us is greater than the one with him. "With him is only an

arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God to help us and to fight our battles." And the people relied on the

words of Hezekiah king of Judah." Second Chronicles thirty two seven eight.

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Please try not to bend it irreversably."
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen grabs said pipe

Whitney G. Elieen adds it to her inventory

Nephi "Longiron" Delano checks the time on his watch once more.

Apologies.

"I wanna marry Whitney!"

((Marrying your mom would be gross, yes))Alexander Hauswald:

Alright.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Shall we draw fate chips, GM?

I drew a legendaryCrystal Saint Claire:

Yes.

Also stop drawing shit.

How do I drawAlexander Hauswald:

You don't.

Unless you're drawing fate chips.0

Fate chi tiiiime!Crystal Saint Claire:

Yeah.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Okay GM, want me to walk you through it?

How do we draw a fate chip from the "pot"Crystal Saint Claire:

Luck of the Irish - I draw one more!Cassie-May O'Brien:

That would be why I said, "Yes."

We'll get to that.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Moondew claims the GM spot because Doc is gone

Wonderful Cowboy Land slaps Moon's shit.

I'm working with Doc on a new initiative system since the one the game comes with is slow as

You can take your actions whenever after your initiative order has come up. They're marked with dots on your

Initiative is rerolled every round.

okCrystal Saint Claire:

We need to get a call who is going.Cassie-May O'Brien:

Or it's gonna be chaos.

But yes, initiative tracker for the Quickness rolls.Cassie-May O'Brien:

((Wouldn't it be easier to just roll Quickness?))Alexander Hauswald:

It would be.Cassie-May O'Brien:

But having multiple actions is kinda a big thing in Deadlands.

If two or more want to act at once, the one with higher Quickness roll this round acts first.Cassie-May O'Brien:

Aye aye.Alexander Hauswald:

You can move and shoot in the same action.

It gets very complicated.

Let's have this explain itself in the game.Cassie-May O'Brien:

For now... let's draw fate chips?

As soon as I get through putting all of them in a deck.

ah.Cassie-May O'Brien:

oh dear.Crystal Saint Claire:

It will take me a bit.

Can we help?Crystal Saint Claire:

Neeeooope.

Moondew is super confused how a character slapped a player

Crystal Saint Claire is busy loading bullets into her gun one at a time, very carefully.

Crystal Saint Claire has CLEARLY never been in an actualy gunfight before.

"Ey, Crystal?"
Said Cassie-May

"Remember to take cover."

"Make sure yer not loadin' those bullets in backwards."
Said Callie

"Lookie-look, sunshine's awake!"
Said Cassie-May

"The flat end goes towards me, right?"
Said Crystal

"Eeeyup."
Said Cassie-May

"The Lord is with you Crystal...and so am I."
Said Whitney

"If the Lord gives us cover we should hide in it."
Said Crystal

"Good thinkin'."
Said Cassie-May

"Lord could give us more than cover."
Said Alexander

"The main issue here is that we do not know where these train robbers will approach from,

and therefore cannot set up our defense appropriately."

Crystal Saint Claire:

Almost done.

Crystal Saint Claire remembers something!

"Hmmmm?"
Said Whitney

"What is it?"

Aw well, still a good shot

It's a hard shot, but Callie manages to take aim through the narrow margin afforded

her by the bouncing train, the slight amount of bandit visible, and the bouncing baddie's mount. The bullet kicks

him in the side of the head and he pitches off his horse.

"...Nice shot."
Said Alexander

"Them's all, or...?"

Bandit Leadslinger tries to stop the flow of blood by pressing one hand to his crotch.

Alexander Hauswald curses,ducking under the window.

"Dry?"
Said Cassie-May

Maybe picking a class that works solely on luck was a horrible ideaAlexander Hauswald:

"Manitous ain't listening.

"Performance issues are common under stress."
Said Crystal

"Kid."
Said Alexander

"Make that kind of joke one more time."

"Yer usin' whut, a Colt Army?"
Said Cassie-May

"Sir?"
Said Crystal

"And I'll quit spoiling the child."

Said Crystal

"Ah got a speedloader."Cassie-May O'Brien:0

You just need a LOT of stats.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

There is an unholy smashing noise from the front of the train.

"I don' need it- What the?"
Said Alexander

You fail and all you lose is an action.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"...Whoa nelly."
Said Cassie-May

You can cast hexes as often as you want.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Big Bawss Bandit opens the door and walks in. His cotton cloth bandages are flowing in the wind that

passes through the train. He is holding a six gun in one hand and a shotgun on his back. The only thing

visible through the bandages and metal plates is one red eye and grimy nubs of fingers.

Oh no.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"What in all that's holy!"

"...Kid."
Said Alexander

"Please tell me your Ghost Shotgun's still got a shot."
Said Alexander

"Yes sir."
Said Crystal

"Miss Crystal! Get down!"
Said Nephi

"And nine in the chamber, sir."
Said Crystal

Big Bawss Bandit points a pistol at Crystal.

"Use them well."
Said Crystal

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers looks at the bawss. "By the power vested in me by the Texas Rangers of the

Confederate States of America, yer under arrest."

Big Bawss Bandit:+06

Three wounds to crystals leg.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

She's scrawny.

Two wounds then.

Take it or negate it?

The shot passes through Crystal's skirts and sends them aflutter.

"...Sacks, no. Shut up."
Said Alexander

We're looking at heavy armor 3 or even 4 here, depending on how thick that metal is.Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Alright, time to bring out the big guns..."
Said Nephi

Big Bawss Bandit pulls the hammer back with one grimy thumb and turns the pistol over to Alexander.

Big Bawss Bandit:02

"Who are you, foul beast, who would harm a child in search of profaned wealth?" She says as

her frown grows in ferocity.

Whitney G. Elieen:

Alexander Hauswald tries to protect Sacks from the shot!000000

"Miss Eileen! Get down!"
Said Nephi

Big Bawss Bandit speaks in a grating voice that sounds a little bit left of human. "Ah'm Big Bawss."

((...Wait a second.))Alexander Hauswald:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano spends an action... SWITCHING TO THE GATLING RIFLE

Whitney G. Elieen hits the deck!

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers motions to the whip on her own belt

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

I got outrageously lucky.

Let me be clear.00000000000000000000000

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Let me be clear how outrageously lucky I just got.

I got a double ace on my to hit.

I got a very high number on my hit location.

And I rolled a ton of aces in damage.

I literally made a one in a million shot.

Big Bawss Bandit takes the three bullets straight to his head. The sheer force of the impact forces him

back onto the ground. He lays still for a moment. He scrabbles to his feet a moment later. His face is a

mass of blood, bone, and metal shards.

"...Hot damn!"
Said Nephi

"...Still walking."
Said Alexander

drops off the horse.

"Also we won't tell anyone about the gross incompetence, so you get to keep your

reputation as a fearsome bandit! Isn't that a win-win for everyone?"

Conductor pokes his head out. He has a scrap of his shirt pressed to his hear. The scrap is soaked

through with blood.

"It was not my work that felled him..."
Said Whitney

"Is it over?"
Said Conductor

"...Guess we're done then."
Said Alexander

"I think it's done."
Said Nephi

Whitney G. Elieen points a finger to the sky then turns to the conductor

Whitney G. Elieen frowns

Crystal Saint Claire nods to the conductor.

"...your ear?"
Said Whitney

"Let me see it please..."

Alexander Hauswald calmly loads his gun.

"..."
Said Cassie-May

"We should get him out of this armor, cuff him, and take a look at his wounds."
Said Crystal

Conductor takes the red scrap of cloth off his ear.

Cassie-May O'Brien reloads herself.

"Preferably in that order."
Said Crystal

"Oh, I'll be fine."
Said Conductor

Whitney G. Elieen leans forward

Whitney G. Elieen reaches her hand out...

"Sloppy."
Said Alexander

"Sloppy as all hell."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano also reloads.

Whitney G. Elieen:+04+010+03080

Whitney places her hand upon the wound and closes her eyes shut...saying a silent prayer that God may deliver

them from their wounds

That's a pass.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"No, Sacks, it's not my fault he didn't listen."
Said Alexander

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers coils her whip back up and then reloads her revolver. "Told 'im he was under

"That...feels better."
Said Conductor

Whitney G. Elieen places her hand upon the injured ear...

Crystal Saint Claire starts removing the armor.

"Wait..."
Said Conductor

Whitney G. Elieen closes her eyes

Conductor feels the side of his head.

"The...hell?"
Said Conductor

Whitney G. Elieen grimmaces ever so slightly

Alexander Hauswald holsters his gun, sighing.

"Thanks for the new ear."
Said Conductor

"..."
Said Nephi

Whitney G. Elieen pulls back, rubbing at her own ears, she opens her eyes with a smile

Whitney G. Elieen shakes her head

"Don't thank me..."
Said Whitney

"Thank the one who works through me."

Crystal Saint Claire is removing armor

"I'm going to go and check on the engine."
Said Conductor

"...Two miracles Ah saw today..."
Said Cassie-May

Crystal Saint Claire cuffs him, after that.

"...Haven't seen that since the preacher-man we traveled with on the road..."
Said Nephi

"Oh! I will join you!"
Said Crystal

"I like engines..."

Big Bawss Bandit snores loudly.

"Luke 22 51"
Said Whitney

"Got a feeling they won't be the last."
Said Alexander

Crystal Saint Claire cuffs the Bawss.

"He is no stranger to mending ears."
Said Whitney

"Sacks, watch the big man."
Said Alexander

Crystal Saint Claire holds out her pistol.

"...Whitney, was it?"
Said Alexander

"Yes...yes Whitney."
Said Whitney

"Whitney Gould Elieen"

"Good job."
Said Alexander

"Here. If he gets out of the cuffs just shoot him. It's set to shotgun right now, at this range

the armor will be insufficient."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Might want to stop his bleeding."
Said Alexander

Cassie-May O'Brien holsters her rifle and begins to remove whatever armor Big Bawws is wearing.

Crystal Saint Claire starts dragging the pieces of armor up the train, towards the engine room.

Cassie-May O'Brien also removes his weapons.

Crystal Saint Claire already did that, Cassie.

"..."
Said Cassie-May

"I have no power but what the Lord has given me...and though this one is a sinner..."
Said Whitney

Cassie-May O'Brien removes his cash, too.

"Would be a waste of keeping him alive."
Said Alexander

(You can have the weapons tho)Crystal Saint Claire:

Whitney G. Elieen leans down and inspects the wounds

"The Lord works in mysterious ways...perhaps he may have use of him in his plan."
Said Whitney

"Either way it is not up to me to decide"

Alexander Hauswald leans against the window, groaning loudly. "Let's try this again."

(Can I try and hex?)Alexander Hauswald:

Crystal manages to get a fair amount of armor off the man. You now have Big Bawws'

scrap armor.

Cassie nicks Big Baww's shotgun and his Colt Navy shooter.

You can hex as often as you like while combat's over.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

What kinda shotgun?Cassie-May O'Brien:

He is bleeding yes?Whitney G. Elieen:

The shotgun is a single shot deal with a sawn off stock that has, "Luk", carved into it.

"Let's see if..."
Said Alexander

Any valuables or boolits?Cassie-May O'Brien:

One thing I'm gonna suggest, Link, is that you invest in upping your dice to d12.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

(Gonna be a lot of chips to save.)Alexander Hauswald:

He has about twenty bullets for the Colt Navy and five twelve gauge shells for the

Is the armor cool?Crystal Saint Claire:

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers moves to a seat and strikes a match to light a cigar. "All in a day's work."

regular shells yes? Not brennekas?Cassie-May O'Brien:

(Can I draw my cards or did I immediately get my magic boolits?)Alexander Hauswald:

It is scrap metal armor pocked with bullet holes. There is a light coating of blood.

Regular shells.

Gimmie a tick.

Anything personalized about it?Crystal Saint Claire:

A name, or an insigina, or a rubber duck

Not the body armor.

I took the helmet, if possible, as well.Crystal Saint Claire:

I think it's grafted onto his face.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

The face plate might have had something on it, but that's a pile of scrap that's

distributed all over his head.

I'm an engineer, I can fix this.Crystal Saint Claire:

Cassie-May O'Brien straightens up, pocketing the shells and bullets, stuffing the Colt Navy in her belt

behind her back, and slinging the single-shot over her arm.

Something feels wrong. It's like an impacted colon, but spiritual. The manitou punches you in the lower duodenum

on the way out of your body.

Two wounds to your guts.

...Demonic constipationCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

Alexander Hauswald grunts in pain, killing over...

"...!"
Said Nephi

"...Whuh?"
Said Cassie-May

"Alex, you get shot?"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads over.

"...Alex?"
Said Whitney

"Whu's wrong, sugercube?"
Said Cassie-May

Whitney G. Elieen turns around

Alexander Hauswald ...before grinning, opening his left hand with a wide grin.

"Are you alright?"
Said Whitney

A trio of bullets, solid as iron, yet strangely spectral, rest in his hand.Alexander Hauswald:

"..."
Said Nephi

"Where'd you get those?"

"Manitou."
Said Alexander

"...What's that?"
Said Nephi

"Spirits. Usually bad news."
Said Callie

"Call it magic."
Said Alexander

"Got taught how to cheat 'em for power."

"This one got mad."

"But yes, basically magic ta make it simple."
Said Callie

"...Y'all a huckster?"
Said Cassie-May

"Close."
Said Alexander

"...Yer all crazy."
Said Nephi

"That makes a lotta sense now that Ah think about it."
Said Callie

"I do gun magic."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano throws up his hands and slings his rifles back into their scabbards.

"Cassie, imagine a huckster an' a gunslinger done fucked an' made a child."
Said Callie

"Looks like yer pet demonCassie-May O'Brien:

Whitney G. Elieen frowns a most troubled of frowns

is mighty ornery today."Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Told you. Got bad luck."
Said Alexander

"Somethin' wrong, Whitney?"
Said Callie

Right now, I need a doctor. I think it rearranged my guts on the way out."Alexander Hauswald:

"Why don'cha ask our miracle werker 'ere?"
Said Cassie-May

"Such is the luck of those who eat of the false tree...but no matter."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen reaches her hand forward

"Let me try"
Said Whitney

"Thank you."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald stands in front of Whitney.

"...Sacks, shut up. She's helping."
Said Alexander

Whitney G. Elieen places a hand upon his injured stomach

Whitney G. Elieen:+05+03+0702

Whitney places her hand upon the wound and closes her eyes shut...saying a silent prayer that God may deliver

them from their wounds

That's a pass!Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

All wounds are healed.

"We get to Kansas City, I find a Huckster."
Said Alexander

Whitney G. Elieen grimaces again, wimpering in pain for but a moment...before all was gone.

The spiritual backup abates and leaves Alexander feeling refreshed and vigorous.Wonderful Cowboy Land:0

Whitney G. Elieen opened her eyes

"Alexander Hauswald:

Your wounds are gone.

"... Whitney.Alexander Hauswald:

"You didn't say it hurts you."

(I'mma grab a smoke. I'll be back in a couple minutes)Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

Whitney, your guts pulse with pain for a moment, then it's gone.

Whitney G. Elieen grips her stomach and gasps...

Nephi "Longiron" Delano carves another notch into his rifle.

Whitney G. Elieen closes her eyes...and sighs

BREAK FOR FIVE MINUTES

"Before I may heal the pain of others, I must be willing to share in it."
Said Whitney

"... Don't suffer my mistakes."
Said Alexander

"It is no mistake to put my faith in the power of the Lord and the majesty he commands."
Said Whitney

"If this is the price he asks of me, so that I may be reminded of my humanity, I shall gladly take it if it may give me

the strength to help others."

"...That's mighty pious an' kind of yew, sugercube."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien tipped her hat.

Alright.

How many folks we got and how much time do all of you have?

It's four AM here.Alexander Hauswald:

Go to bread.

"... Turn the other cheek, huh?"
Said Alexander

I was about to say XDWhitney G. Elieen:

You and Varmus should go sleep!

We will continue this next time.

"That is what he has taught."
Said Whitney

Can we get to town maybe?Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Somewhere we can buy stuff and trade?

You get to town as soon as I change off this map.

It's 3 AM hereCassie-May O'Brien:

Are you ready.

soooCassie-May O'Brien:

Let's hurry and get to townNephi "Longiron" Delano:

"...Anyone want tha' single shotty or tha' Colt Navy of his?"
Said Cassie-May

"Give me the Navy."
Said Alexander

"Here y'all go, sug."
Said Cassie-May

"This rod will suffice for me."
Said Whitney

Big Bawws' Colt Navy added to Alex's equipmentCassie-May O'Brien:

"Not quite the staff of moses but through even the simplest instrument he can work wonders"
Said Whitney

"When we get to Kansas City, I need help finding something for luck."
Said Alexander

"Y'all Moses'd up tha' guy alright enough fer meh."
Said Cassie-May

"Any takers fer th' shotty?"

"If nawt, jus' gunna pawn it off."

After an exhilarating battle on the train where much excitement was had by all, the

train pulls into Kansas City. It is a fairly large town. There's saloons and shops around, as well as the marshalry

Going to assume you guys head over to the saloon and pick out some rooms.

Darn tootin'.Cassie-May O'Brien:

Grand.Alexander Hauswald:

Rooms are a half dollar for seven nights.

Two can stay in a room.

And since no one is wanting, Cassie is gonna sell that single shotty of BawwsCassie-May O'Brien:

I'll room with Alex. Bros before hoes.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"I stay with Whitney dibs!"
Said Crystal

"...Also can I look at th e shotgun?"

Too late, Nephi.Alexander Hauswald:

"Looks like it's us two, Callie."
Said Cassie-May

Sacks called dibs on the second bed.Alexander Hauswald:

"Wh-"
Said Nephi

"He doesn't get a bed all to himself!"

"Rrrrrf."
Said Sacks

Cassie-May O'Brien gives Crystal the single shotgun then!

"Here y'all go."
Said Cassie-May

"...Okay okay, fine. He'll get his own bed."
Said Nephi

"Ain' need it mahself."
Said Cassie-May

What day is it!Whitney G. Elieen:

The bartender at the establishment twiddles his mustache and takes the dosh from

each of you. He hands out keys to those who have paid him and goes back to serving the other cowpokes.

That's... Two bucks?Sacks:

"Mah treat, Calliie."
Said Cassie-May

"Given what we have went through..."
Said Whitney

Half dollar is fifty cents.

"I think it is only fair that you may sleep in for an hour this morning~"
Said Whitney

Cassie-May O'Brien paid for the room of hers and Callie for the week.

"May I stay up late tonight?"
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien gave the Bawws' shotty to Crystal.

"For an hour, yes!"
Said Whitney

I'm gonna trust you guys to handle the money.

Those who want to go to bed can go to bed.

"I shall pay our way Crystal."
Said Whitney

"Worry not about your purse"

Those who do not may engage in drinking, card playing, or carousin'.

Whitney does not do the drinking or the carousinWhitney G. Elieen:

Do she play the cards?

I think I'll head to bed and work the prices tomorrow.Sacks:

lol noWhitney G. Elieen:

Depending on the day she will go to the shops tomorrowWhitney G. Elieen:

Then Whitney sit on the bed in her room and have a happy time with Crystal.

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers nods to Cassie. "Thank ya kindly."

Nini VarmCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

Goodnight you two, thanks for putting up with this travesty.

"I do not own a purse."
Said Crystal

I liked getting to go full-on policeCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"Silly Crystal...I had meant your finances as a whole."
Said Whitney

Anything any of those left wish to do?

Nothing I can think ofCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

I'm gonna buy a deck of cards.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

And my own room just for me I guess since nobody wants to bunk with Nephi

The deck of cards is three cents.

The room is the aforementioned half dollar.

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers checks her Ranger's Bible to see if the Big Bawss if listed in there as an

outstanding Ranger Bounty

Whitney will change into her night garments and spend the evening praying as Crystal does

her inventor things.

Whitney G. Elieen:

He is not listed in there. Must be some new dude on the scene.

"Welp, he might have a normal bounty on 'im then."
Said Callie

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers goes to the sheriff's office to see if he's on the bounty list and if not, just to turn

him in

Do this.

Next session.

Roger thatCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

When you actually go to the Marshalry and stuff.

Then I think I'm done for this sessionCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

Said Nephi

"M'not goin in there when she's in her skivvies."

"She sleeps in bedclothes."

"Still improper."

"It's just like my pajamas!"

"A man shouldn't look on a woman in her skivvies!"
Said Nephi

"She's just slightly more sumptuous than I am!"
Said Crystal

"A-"
Said Nephi

"Yer words, not mine."

"It's not skivvies, it's pajamas!"
Said Crystal

Yuppie.

Welcome to this.00

This is taking place in the hall outside Whitney and Crystal's room.Crystal Saint Claire:

"Do you really need my help with the measurements?"
Said Nephi

This argument, anyway.Crystal Saint Claire:

Whitney can hear this if she puts any effort at all into listening.

"...I can't reach far enough."
Said Crystal

"..."
Said Nephi

"I have tiny arms!"
Said Crystal

"Tiny little dino arms."
Said Nephi

Crystal Saint Claire flaps her arms around for emphasis

Of course.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano says with a teasing smile.

"We just gotta go in, measure, go out."
Said Crystal

"She won't even know, she's probably asleep by now."

"..."
Said Nephi

"...Yer suuuure about that?"

"She was almost done with The Lord's Prayer when I left."
Said Crystal

"Cuz if she wakes up and sees me an'you sneakin into her room..."
Said Nephi

"Something about bread."
Said Crystal

"..."
Said Nephi

"Yer my excuse."

"Maybe I wanted to get a drink and you were making sure I wasn't raped in the night then."
Said Crystal

"All fallin on your head if this goes wrong."
Said Nephi

"Let's go with that."
Said Crystal

"...Lord, forgive me."
Said Nephi

"There's a shorter verse."

Roll sneak.

Whitney G. Elieen is completely and utterly focused upon her holy communion.

Crystal Saint Claire does it again, but s l o w e r

It takes.

Five minutes.

To sign this.

Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano shakes his head and just approaches.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano does it slooooower.

Crystal Saint Claire frantically signs to disengage

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is completely clueless

"I thank you Lord for your providence. For giving me the power to aid our friends in the fight

against evil...thank thee for leading us here into this land, delivering us from evil and into your loving grasp..."

Whitney G. Elieen:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano approaches and then gestures like a normal person for Crystal to follow.

Crystal Saint Claire shrugs

Crystal Saint Claire approaches

Nephi "Longiron" Delano gestures frantically towards Whitney, and then mimes using measuring tape.

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire pulls out some string and a charcoal pencil

Nephi "Longiron" Delano just STARES.

Crystal Saint Claire pulls out a knife?

Nephi "Longiron" Delano makes more exasperated and aggravated gestures.

Crystal Saint Claire puts the knife back.

Crystal no.

That's not how you measure people.

Crystal Saint Claire takes out a bigger knife

Nephi "Longiron" Delano mimes NONONONONO

Crystal Saint Claire scalpel?

Nephi "Longiron" Delano rubs his temples.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano tries to mime a bag, like Crystal's carpet bag.

Crystal Saint Claire points under the bed

Nephi "Longiron" Delano tries to get it

Rollin stealth!Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Roll cog Whitney.

Whitney G. Elieen:

Nephi's scrapes his way along the ground with inexorable slowness. He rustles

around under the bed and grabs the carpetbag. Then he wriggles his way backward.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano opens the bag and digs through it to search for some kind of measuring tape or

other device.

There's some measuring tape underneath a bunch of samples of something that you

don't want to think about.

The samples are visceral.

They glisten in the light.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano grabs the tape.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano moves forwards.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano watches Crystal, hoping for instruction.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has never done this before.

Whitney G. Elieen reaches an arm to the sight of the disturbance

Huh, nothing there.

Must have been the wind.

Or the hands of God caressing your form as you pray to him.

Or more accurately, her chest.

Crystal Saint Claire prays for two things

"Lord thank you for your patience with me...thank you for the gentle caress of friends and the

warmth of their embrace."

Whitney G. Elieen:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is unable to keep his wanderin eyes off the same area.

heart and soul...

Whitney, you feel an arm clasped in yours.

This is the hand of the Lord.

Embrace it.

Whitney has hold of your arm.

"Your presence is here with me, even now my Lord..."
Said Whitney

It is sandwiched neatly between her tits.

Crystal Saint Claire frantically signs the measurements to Nephi one-handed

Nephi "Longiron" Delano starts turning red.

They are warm and voluptuous.

"Reaching out to me. Thank you Lord that I have been blessed with signs of your presence."
Said Whitney

Nephi "Longiron" Delano writes them down on some paper in the carpet bag.

Whitney G. Elieen opens her eyes

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is standing there in a half-crouch with a carpet bag and notepad in his hands

Nephi "Longiron" Delano freezes the moment he sees Whitney open her eyes

Whitney G. Elieen looks to the hand wedged between her chest

"..."
Said Nephi

Yeah that's Crystal's hand alright.

Whitney G. Elieen clasps the tiny hand in her giant ones and frowned

"Why did you pretend to be the holy son?"
Said Whitney

"...you smooshed it there and I paniced."
Said Crystal

Nephi "Longiron" Delano huffs and pants and then sloooowly slides down the door with his back to it

before collapsing into a heap.

"I panicked a lot."
Said Crystal

"...And Nephi? What were you attempting to do...?"
Said Whitney

Nephi you might want to move to a different town.

And change your name.

Whitney G. Elieen sounds completely and utterly confused

And get a haircut.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is seriously considering it.

"He was transcribing the measurements."
Said Crystal

"...measurements?"
Said Whitney

Nephi "Longiron" Delano starts by taking off his hat and turning his duster inside out

"Yes."
Said Crystal

"Whatever for?"
Said Whitney

Nephi "Longiron" Delano begins planning to change his name again

"Oi wus gonna make yer a gift, a vest, but oi did not nu yisser measurements an' oi wanted

it ter be a surprise an..."

Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire has suddenly sprouted an Irish accent, and looks like she's gonna cry.

"..."
Said Whitney

Meanwhile in Whitney's mind.

Whitney G. Elieen takes her other hand

Whitney G. Elieen reaches it forward

Whitney G. Elieen places it gently upon your cheek...and smiled

"...Oh Crystal...how simpler this would have been if you told me!"
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen frowns again, her head at a tilt

"Pray with me...ask for forgiveness for impersonating the voice of the Lord. This is my

penance to you."

Whitney G. Elieen:

Whitney G. Elieen said as she took her hand and patted the ground next to her

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire nods.

"Then you can finish your measurements and you can tell Nephi he need not fear retribution

from me."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"So long as his thoughts and intentions were pure..."

"He just wanted to help me..."
Said Crystal

Call it high or low.(To Poage):

"I believe you..."
Said Whitney

"And I forgive you."

"Now pray with me. Real quick...and than fetch Nephi."

Crystal Saint Claire bows her head.

"And thank you for thinking of me Crystal. I am nothing without the Lord...but even a wretch

like me appreciates the grace of kindness."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire is mumbling a prayer.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is saying another prayer very loudly.

And the Lord regarded his Creation.

And it was good.

"Thank you for helping me with my ideas. And thank you for Whitney. I hope you can

help her with a realization, like you did me. Help her realize she's worth loving, and that I love her."

"I shall finish my prayers for the evening"

Whitney G. Elieen looks down at her chest, her expression growing thoughtful...

Crystal Saint Claire heads out to find Nephi!

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is in his room pacing back and forth.

Whitney G. Elieen looks closely at her own hands...

"...And if I buy a horse today I can be in El Paso by noon this time..."
Said Nephi

Nephi, you probably won't have to deal with Whitney's wrath if you eat your gun.

Crystal Saint Claire knocks gently

"It's Crystal"
Said Crystal

"...Going to need to pool all my money..."
Said Nephi

She might damn your eternal soul though.

"She's not gonna kill us"
Said Crystal

"..."
Said Nephi

"I don't believe you."

"She is not even that mad, realy."
Said Crystal

"And is definitely not standing behind me."

She totes is.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano slooooowly unlocks and opens the door.

Crystal Saint Claire:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano peeks a single eye through

"...Yer fulla shit."
Said Nephi

"Okay but she is not mad"
Said Crystal

"What do I have to do to convince you?"

"Write down the rest of the measurements for you?"

"...I got everything you signed to me written on-"
Said Nephi

"...We got all her chest measurements, right?"

"I have a few rough estimates for the rest of her."
Said Crystal

"..."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano turns a little red.

"Accurate within a quarter inch!"
Said Crystal

"...Yeah, ah..."
Said Nephi

"She hugged me for a bit."
Said Crystal

"S'good and all, but..."
Said Nephi

"It was nice."
Said Crystal

Nephi "Longiron" Delano plays with the collar of his shirt.

"...M'thinkin it's real improper for me to know."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:0

"She smells like cinnamon and candle smoke."
Said Crystal

"She's a nice member o'the lady folk, and despi-"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano closes his eyes and tries really hard not to think about it.

"But the cinnamon is subtle."
Said Crystal

Nephi "Longiron" Delano tries really really hard.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"...I think I get the picture."

Nephi, she has HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE tracts of land.

Tracts to make the Salt Lake jealous?Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

I'll take that for a yes.

"Here's yer stuff."

"...I'll be in my bunk."

"She wanted to talk to you"
Said Crystal

Nephi "Longiron" Delano sets Crystal's carpet bag and notepad down outside.

"Oh, uh... Aight."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano clears his throat.

"I uh, need a minute."
Said Nephi

"Okay! I understand."
Said Crystal

"...Gotta get all my stuff um... Back together."
Said Nephi

Nephi are you havingWhitney G. Elieen:

"Yeah. That's it."
Said Nephi

Meanwhile in Nephi's mind.

"MAybe I can help! Having a system for where things go is good."
Said Crystal

"Put everything somewhere, you know?"

"N-naw, I'm all good."
Said Nephi

"...Just a quick sec."

Nephi you need some time to think about this.

"Is everything packed properly?"
Said Crystal

Nephi "Longiron" Delano closes the door.

Possibly with a sock.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano tries to think about anything else.

Crystal Saint Claire gets the door close.

Roll cog Nephi.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano thinks about the Skullchucker team. He thinks about ice cream sundae's.

Crystal Saint Claire sits down outside and begins sketching up a blueprint for an armored vest.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

(To GM) rolling 2d10kh1!!

Wonderful Cowboy Land:03

Sundaes, yes.

The ones with...cherries on top.

So firm.

Big mounds of...Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Ice cream...

Supple and soft on the tongue.

How fiiiiine...Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Crystal Saint Claire is sipping on a root beer

Nephi "Longiron" Delano suddenly realizes he's not thinking about ice cream anymore.000

Nephi "Longiron" Delano shakes his head and shakes it off.

Roll Cog.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano slaps himself for good measure.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

At a bonus.

Crystal Saint Claire is sucking at the straw making those slurping noises when the glass is empty

(To GM) rolling 2d10kh1!!

Wonderful Cowboy Land:01

UH, YEAH.

MAN STUFF

PLATONIC SHOWERING IN A GROUP.

YEAH

HOO RAH.

NO FEMALE STUFF HERE

NOT IN THIS HEAD

NO SIR

Nephi "Longiron" Delano sets off, with his shootin iron back in its holster.

That is it for me tonight.

I hope all of you had fun.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads back to Whitney's room, knocking on the door.

"Come in! Come in..."
Said Whitney

"Are uh... You decent?"
Said Nephi

"Yes. Yes I am decent..."
Said Whitney

Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads inside.000

"Hey uh, hey lissen, ah didn't..."
Said Nephi

"Think nothing of it...I do ask that you ask for forgiveness for the deception to the one who

reigns above."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"...Mean ta..."
Said Nephi

"Ah told her it was a bad idea!"

"But I forgive your transgression...it was a bad idea maybe but it came from a place of

Whitney G. Elieen:

"But she asked me real nice and I looked down and she reminded me so much of lil'

Ishmael that..."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano kicks out a foot...

"...I didn't wanna say no and leave her hangin like that."
Said Nephi

"Someone's been real mean to that poor girl in the past and I didn't wanna be just another fella that letter down."

(We will pick this up later!)Whitney G. Elieen:

(Fair enough!)Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

(Goodnight you two. This was fun!)Whitney G. Elieen:

A blue for all.

Now goodnight!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

LISTENIN TO BANJO

AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO LIARS.

Doc (GM) pushes that character back under the table.

Will slowpost because also Savages.

Are you also here?

I don't think he here right now.

Let's see...

Alexander is up. Something feels off. There is no light coming in through the window shutters in his room above

the saloon proper. More than one someone is downstairs making noise. Perhaps, it would be a good idea to

"..."
Said Alexander

"Sacks. Wake up."

"Rrrruff?"
Said Sacks

Alexander Hauswald slides into his boots- thankfully, he only has one sets- and grabs his gun, walking

down with the sixshooter ready.\

Sacks follows after him.

Alexander squeaks down the stairs and comes upon a mostly dark bar. There is one

lighted table. Three figures are clustered around it. The Bartender from last night is one of them. The other two are

harder to recognize. There is an open seat.

"..."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald slowly holsters his gun, squinting.

"...I don't trust this either, Sacks."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald walks closer, sighing before he sits down at the open spot.

"What's going on?"
Said Alexander

Bartender perks up from where he is hunched over a pair of cards.

"Ah, one of the new fellas."
Said Bartender

"That I am. Can't seem to sleep."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald idly pets Sacks.

"Take a seat and play a while."
Said Bartender

"What're we playing?"
Said Alexander

"Hold 'Em ese."
Said Gun

"The mustachioed bastard keeps clearing me out."

"Well."
Said Alexander

"You know how to play?"
Said General

Alexander Hauswald adjusts in his seat.

"I know the basics."
Said Alexander

"Alright then, I'll deal you in."
Said Bartender

"Go ahead."
Said Alexander

(Be back inna tick)

Bartender slides a twenty five cent coin across the table.

"Call."
Said General

General Store Owner slides his own coin to the center of the table.

"Aye aye, call."
Said Gun

Gun Runner flicks a quarter into the pot.

Alexander Hauswald slides his own coin.

"Call."
Said Alexander

Make a faith check for me.Bartender:

((I got no faith.))Alexander Hauswald:

Bartender slides out three cards from the deck and places them face up near the pot.

(Spirit check)Bartender:

Alexander Hauswald:01

(To GM) rolling 3d12kh1!!

(To GM) rolling 3d10kh1!!

(To GM) rolling 3d8kh1!!

Gun Runner face seems to flicker for a moment, becoming less distinct. The effect lasts only an instant

Alexander Hauswald remains silent, his free hand resting on his lap.

"Next round of bets."
Said Bartender

Bartender puts a quarter into the pot.

"Think I'll up the ante a lil."
Said General

General Store Owner slides a big, shiny half dollar across the table and into the pile of coins.

"Son of a bitch, you're going to bleed me dry."
Said Gun

Gun Runner slides a half dollar into the pot.

"He can do it if he's got the cards to back it up."
Said Bartender

Bartender puts another quarter in the growing mass of coinage.

Alexander Hauswald slides his own fifty cents in, his face sealed.

Same check.Bartender:

Alexander Hauswald:+04

(To GM) rolling 3d12kh1!!

(To GM) rolling 3d10kh1!!

(To GM) rolling 3d8kh1!!

Gun Runner hat seems to change shape for a second. It becomes smaller and more weathered. Then he

reaches up and adjusts it. Still a sombrero.

"...Nice hat."
Said Alexander

General Store Owner face becomes a little more lined and aquiline. He reaches up and smooths it out in a

Nephi "Longiron" Delano eventually comes down the stairs to the main floor, looking groggy as anything.

"Thanks ese, is that one of your friends?"
Said Gun

"One that looks like chewed shit?"

"...Mmmister Alex?"
Said Nephi

"Yes."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks around the room.

Alexander Hauswald turns towards Nephi.

"You folks playin cards?"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano rubs his eyes.

"I just came down to see if I couldn't find a nice tall glass o'water."
Said Nephi

"We are boy, care to join us?"
Said General

((Here I expected a "Why are you sitting alone"))Alexander Hauswald:

"...Well, why not. I'm mighty tired, though."
Said Nephi

"Might be..."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is interrupted by a yawn.

"Crawlin back into bed after a few hands."
Said Nephi

"I'll get you a nice cool soda if you steal the pot from me next hand."
Said Bartender

"...Oh yer on."
Said Nephi

"We'll finish this one up, then deal you in."
Said Bartender

Nephi "Longiron" Delano pops a seat next to Alex.

"Next to last round."
Said Bartender

"Thrown down your money."0

Bartender puts a twenty five cent piece in the pot.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano reaches into a belt pouch in front of his other package and pulls out a sack filled

with coins.

General Store Owner scratches his cheek for a couple of seconds before doing the same.

"Usually don't like playin for cash. God says it's a sin, but everybody's gotta do

somethin to pass the time."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"I don't think you two gringos have any damn tells."
Said Gun

Gun Runner tosses a quarter into the pile of coins.

"Call and raise."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald throws fifty cents in.

"Brave fella."
Said Bartender

The other players slide in another quarter to match.

"Last round."
Said Bartender

"Make your plays."

Spirit check from both of you.

Alexander Hauswald:+04

I got Faith.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Roll that.Bartender:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:+03+05

Bartender has something stretching out behind his head, like tree branches, but after a blink the figment

of Nephi's imagination is gone.

"So, Mister Alex, you got any family?"
Said General

"..."
Said Nephi

"I uh... I'll be back soon."

"See you later cowpoke."
Said Bartender

((Am I seeing the same?))Alexander Hauswald:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks to Alex warily, unsettled a little bit.

"...Big brother. Nobody else."
Said Alexander

(A little bit, but less than Nephi.)Bartender:

Bartender knocks on the table.

"Check."
Said Bartender

"Check..."
Said General

"I don't trust you."
Said Gun

Alexander Hauswald closes his eyes.

"Interesting, your big brother doing alright then?"
Said General

"Not really. Gone missing."
Said Alexander

"Shame."
Said General

"Lay down your cards and let's see who gets the pot."
Said Bartender

"Read 'em and weep boys."0

"Two royal pairs."
Said Alexander

"Should have known."
Said General

((Who's hand is who's?))Alexander Hauswald:

"God damn, sneaky son of a bitch."
Said Gun

"Looks like you're splitting the pot with me."
Said Bartender

"Works fine for me."
Said Alexander

(He's actually splitting it with the Gun Runner, who can replicate his hand, since he has the Joker.)Gun Runner:

(Hum.)Alexander Hauswald:

The bald man with the mustache and the Gun Runner halve the pot and take their cut.

Go with that for now.

"Thank you for the game."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald eyes them suspiciously.

"You staying for another hand?"
Said Bartender

"...One more hand."
Said Alexander

"Alright, glad to have you."
Said Bartender

"Gets kind of old just playing with these two stodgers."

"First round of bettin'."

Bartender slaps a half dollar down.

"Call."
Said Alexander

"Call."
Said General

"Call ese."
Said Gun

Alexander Hauswald keeps looking at the trio, trying to understand what's going on.

Spirit check.Gun Runner:

Gun Runner:

Gun Runner:

You're just playing some cards with the folks from around Kansas City Alexander,

nothing to worry about.

"Looking good, maybe."
Said Bartender

"I'll put down a dollar on this one."

"Hell hoss, you know I don't got that kinda scratch just laying around."
Said General

((Coooooould I use guesstimate to see if he's bluffing?))Alexander Hauswald:

"I'm calling. You're nothing but a bluff."
Said Gun

You can.

Roll it

Alexander Hauswald:+03+05+0804

Was that a twitch?

It looked like a twitch.

Little hard to tell in this light, but there's something going on.0000

Call that sucker.

"Call."
Said Alexander

Spirit check.Bartender:

Alexander Hauswald:04

Bartender scoots his chair back from the table for a moment and digs around in his pockets.

"Here, let me sweeten this honey pot."
Said Bartender

Bartender places a single card face down into the pot. It has a coal black backing with a big, stylized white

H in the middle of it.

"You mankey bastard."
Said Gun

Alexander, you get the feeling you're going to have to go all in to match that.

(To GM) rolling 3d12kh1!!

(To GM) rolling 3d10kh1!!

(To GM) rolling 3d8kh1!!

"...I raise."
Said Alexander

"I might have misjudged you boy."
Said Bartender

"You've got iron in you."

Make a spirit check, at a bonus.0000

(How much bonus?)Alexander Hauswald:

You should be good.Bartender:

(To GM) rolling 3d12kh1!!

(To GM) rolling 3d10kh1!!

(To GM) rolling 3d8kh1!!

Alexander, these fellas are not what they seem.

You blink, and then you see them.

One man in a red suit with a cow's skull for a mask. The antlers stretching up into the blackness surrounding the

table. You think the bartender was sitting there. Where the General Store Manager was, there is now a white

boned skeleton wearing a red jacket. The bones gives a happy little wave. The Gun Runner has been replaced by

something...wrong. You can't see its face. When your eyes try to tell your brain what they see, the signal gets

garbled and broken. All you can tell is that he is wearing a battered Stetson and red stained riding duds.

"My my..."???:

"...Game's up, folks."
Said Alexander

"Oh no, you've got to play this hand out."???:

"Sorry friend, but scratchy is right."

Gimmie a tick0000

For the last bit.

"You want to wager anything more, or just see where all that iron has landed you?"???:

"What're you accepting?"
Said Alexander

"The most valuable thing you've got."???:

Alexander Hauswald pauses, surprised.

"...We're playing for Thomas?"
Said Alexander

"I suppose we could."???:

"If you were willing to put yourself up."

"..."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald grabs a dollar.

"I raise."
Said Alexander

Alexander.

This doesn't feel right.

It might be time to do a little...

More Guesstimating?Alexander Hauswald:

Make a Huckstering or Hexslinging roll.

The rolls that you were making to get cards last game.

((That's what, 5d12?))Alexander Hauswald:

I believe so.

Alexander Hauswald:+01+011+0804

Good, good.

How advantageous?Alexander Hauswald:

I'll show you in a second.???:

Alexander lays down the two cards he drew from, hell if he knows where.

((The 5 and 8 are mine?))Alexander Hauswald:

"You got hustled you old cuss. He fuckin' nailed your ass!"?:

The two nines are yours.

That makes four a of a kind for you.

...Alexander Hauswald:

It beats pretty much any hand.

My goodness.Alexander Hauswald:

"Nice one."??:

"Haven't seen anyone do that since..."

"I don't think I can remember."

"Collect your winnings boy."

"We'll be seeing each other a little later down the line for the rest of your reward."

"..."
Said Alexander

"What about Thomas?"

Alexander blinks, and the table has no players left at it.

There is, however, a sizable pile of money, and that odd card.

"..."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald checks the card, first. It seemed valuable enough for the players to be surprised by.

Holy shit.

That's one of Hoyle's cards.

"...Well now."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald quickly stashes in in his pocket, before looking at the money.

The money looks, a bit different in this light.

The coins are all from various ages, some look older, some look newer. Some gleam with a hint of gold in them.

Some are made from some metal that you don't know of.

All of them are, assumedly, valuable.

Best to take them all and sort through them at a later date.

"..."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald sweeps them all into his pocket. Better do this after he slept.

"..Wouldn't believe it either, Sacks. Wouldn't believe it either."
Said Alexander

Gain ten coins of indeterminate origin.

Use them when you really need something.

That'll be all for now partner.

Do I need to write the specific Hoyle's Card?Alexander Hauswald:

Lemmie see.

The Four of Hearts.

I'll mark it for you.

And this lets me pull an extra card when I draw, for a total of 6 cards per spellcast.Alexander Hauswald:

Yep.

Awesome.Alexander Hauswald:

This was intensely fun.

Seeya next sesh.

Righto mate.

Take a red chip.

I'll just mark it on his sheet.

There we go.

(Yo)Alexander Hauswald:

(...So what do, really?)Alexander Hauswald:

Right. I assume the setting's in the saloon we all settled in?Alexander Hauswald:

In that case...

Cassie-May O'Brien was sitting at one of the tables, a mug of steaming coffee and a glass of whiskey that

might have had ice inside once sitting beside her heavy riding boots, perched on the wooden surface.

Alexander Hauswald climbs down, groggy, followed by that damn mutt of his. He looks around, yawning,

before taking something out- you can't make it from here- out of his shirt pocket, examine it intently,

before walking down.

"Howdy, pardnah! Slept well?"
Said Cassie-May

"Not really."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald stretches, groaning.

"Had a strange dream."
Said Alexander

"Yew an' meh both."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien grabbed her coffee.

"Care ta share?"
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald stepped over, sitting down next to her.

"Played poker with ghosts."
Said Alexander

"Huh."
Said Cassie-May

Alexander Hauswald lets a tiny grin break the stoic facade.

"I won, too. Got a card."
Said Alexander

"Gewd fer yew, pardnah. Ah guess."
Said Cassie-May

"If only. I think the bet was my brother. Things are getting foggy."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald takes a look at Sacks.\

Sacks barks.

"Ain' nothin' good yew can find in dreams, Alex."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien took a huge gulp of coffee and chased it with a sip of whiskey.

(That was Alex)Alexander Hauswald:

"...Speak fer yerself."
Said Cassie-May

"...Too early for drinking, no?"
Said Alexander

"Whut'cher gunna do 'bout it, dad? Send meh to mah room?"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien cracked a grin.

"...I'm not that old."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald looks around for something.

"And yes."
Said Alexander

"Yes?"
Said Cassie-May

"I'll send you to your room."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald grins again. You think.

"Bahah!"
Said Cassie-May

Sacks looks at Cassie with a disapproving glare.

"...Not my fault she found it funny, Sacks."
Said Alexander

"See, Sacks, this gal here ain' takin' orders."
Said Cassie-May

"Funny. Neither does he."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald shrugs.

"Dumber than a sack of hammers."
Said Alexander

Sacks rolls his eyes. You never knew a dog can roll his eyes.

Cassie-May O'Brien didn't seem to notice that.

"Y'all shouldn' be badmouthin' poor Nephi while he ain' here."
Said Cassie-May

"That's just rude."
Said Alexander

"Sacks doesn't like him. But he's alright."

"Jus' makin' a joke, pardnah."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien raised her hands defensively.

"Nuthin' bad meant."
Said Cassie-May

Alexander Hauswald shrugs.

"Can't tell some of the time. Never had enough to laugh at."
Said Alexander

"Realleh naw? This gal here's thinkin' y'all gotta find yer fun where yew can, life ain' gonne

give yew rose marmelade."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Well, I don't get the chance. Too busy with something."
Said Alexander

"Realleh naw? Whuzzit?"
Said Cassie-May

Alexander Hauswald 's face grims for a second. He pulls away, heading towards the counter, and after a

minute or two with the bartender, comes back with a glass of water.

"...My brother. He's been kidnapped."
Said Alexander

"...Darn, tha's awful. Ah'm real sorry ta hear that, pardnah."
Said Cassie-May

"Don't be. I'll find him."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald sighs, looks around, and taps his Colt Army on the glass. The liquid immediately

starts shifting color...

Cassie-May O'Brien 's eyes widened.

"...Nobody's watching us, I hope."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald keeps doing that, waiting before there's a glass of something... VAGUELY liquid that

could pass as coffee. If you had no sense of smell or had no idea what coffee was.

"...Did y'all jus' turn water ta coffee jus' like tha'."
Said Cassie-May

"Cheaper than buying it."
Said Alexander

"Tastes like it, too."

"You an' meh gunne be them bestest of friends."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien fluttered her eyelids.

"... It's really bad."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald thinks that changes anything.

"It's coffee."
Said Cassie-May

"Theoretically. It's what manitous think coffee is."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald takes a sip, cringes, and takes another one.

"Why'd you agree to this?"
Said Alexander

"Ta whut, Marshalin'?"
Said Cassie-May

Alexander Hauswald nods.

"Just curious."
Said Alexander

"Ah jus' wanna help out them folks, Ah guess. An' bein' a Marshall coulda help meh wit'

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"...Noble of you.Alexander Hauswald:

I did this to find Thomas."

Crystal Saint Claire walks down the stairs, wearing a stained labcoat over a set of pajamas. She yawns,

Crystal Saint Claire gets her cup, and sits with the two faces she recognizes.

"Howdy, sleepin' princess."
Said Cassie-May

"Morning, kid."
Said Alexander

Sacks sniffs Crystal's pajamas curiously. And barks happily!Sacks:

"So, Thomas is yer brother's name?"
Said Cassie-May

"...good moring"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire has not lifted her face from the table

"Yep. Been just us for a while."
Said Sacks

"Yep. Been just us for a while."
Said Alexander

"Must be nice, sugercube. If Ah can help yew out findin' him, count me in."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien offered Alex her hand for a shake.

Alexander Hauswald shakes it with his free hand.

"..."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald looks at the remainder of his cup. And then at Crystal.

"Kid, need some coffee?"
Said Alexander

Crystal Saint Claire shakes her head

"I do not like the taste"
Said Crystal

".Alexander Hauswald:

"...Then you'll really hate this."

Crystal Saint Claire sits up, sipping at the cup in her hand

"I have this."
Said Crystal

"Yes?"
Said Alexander

"Mmmhm?"
Said Cassie-May

"How much do either of you know about... I forget what they are called."
Said Crystal

"They cause the mortially challenged, they are similar to ghosts..."

"Manitous."
Said Alexander

Crystal Saint Claire waves her arms about a little to indicate a spooky ghost

"Yes, those."
Said Crystal

"Some sorta Injun spirits. Or biblical demons. Or both."
Said Alexander

"Ah done werked fer th' Agency fer a while. Ah dun' saw more manure than flows through

Mississipi in a year."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Cassie-May O'Brien paused.

"An', uh, Ah'd be grateful if y'all didn' go 'round tellin' Ah wuz werkin' fer them black hats."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald reaches into his pocket.

Alexander Hauswald pulls out a badge and slides it on the table.

Crystal Saint Claire yawns

"Consider it forgotten"
Said Crystal

"On the same boat."
Said Alexander

"...Huh."
Said Cassie-May

"But... how capable do you believe manticores are of affecting living beings?"
Said Crystal

"Manitous."
Said Cassie-May

"... I can explain, kinda."
Said Alexander

"Anyone can learn this. But it's hard and risky."

Crystal Saint Claire perks up.

"You can?"
Said Crystal

"And hexslinging has to be taught by a person, not a book."
Said Alexander

"When you hex, you let a manitou in your body."

"And then you do a little fight with it in your head. It can be anything. My teacher used chess, I use poker."

"And if you win, it has to do what you tell it to and scram."

"Sometimes it wins. Sometimes it has room to punch you on the way out."

Alexander Hauswald points at Sacks.

"My familiar. Longer than just a hex, but he's as smart as us now."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald moves his eyes to Sacks, sighing.

"Yes, Sacks, that includes Nephi."
Said Alexander

"...So"
Said Crystal

"What if one is not Hexing"

"Do manitous often communicate with the living?"

"Woulda explain mah dreams."
Said Cassie-May

"I think they can."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald looks around and pulls out a playing card.

"Got this last night from playing against them."
Said Alexander

"Interesting!"
Said Crystal

"...so are they evil?"

"..."
Said Alexander

"Eeeeeyup."
Said Cassie-May

Alexander Hauswald shrugs.

"Them's evil."
Said Cassie-May

"No more than humans."
Said Alexander

"More than humans.'Cassie-May O'Brien:

"You'll be surprised."
Said Alexander

"Nah Ah wouldn'."
Said Cassie-May

Alexander Hauswald sips his """Coffee"""" calmly.

"I cheat them for magic. I'd know."
Said Alexander

"Whutever."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien sipped her coffee.

"I would imagine there are outliers on either side."
Said Crystal

"Bah. I met nice ones. I met rude ones. They're all the same."
Said Alexander

Cassie-May O'Brien switched to whiskey.

"So... there are some people who claim the ideas of... inventors, such as myself, are often

influenced by such beings. So I was considering an experiment."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"But for it to work, I'd need to speak to at least one Manitou, in person or through a go-between somehow."

"...Bad idea."
Said Alexander

"Real bad idea."
Said Cassie-May

"....Sacks says it's a bad idea too."
Said Alexander

"Why?"
Said Crystal

"According to mythos, manitous can be cheated. That means they follow rules, for the most part, no?"

"It's risky. You could dieAlexander Hauswald:

. Or worse."

"If I die, I will be consigned to oblivion. Whitney told me so."
Said Crystal

"If yew die, yer soul gonne be captured by them an' tortured fer eternity in their home."
Said Cassie-May

"Believe meh, Ah know sumthin' 'bout it."

Cassie-May O'Brien shuddered, downed her whiskey in one shot, and chased with a huge gulp of coffe.

"...Hauswald, you've spoken with a manitou, have you not?"
Said Crystal

"Perhaps you could help me!"

"I'd rather not, kid."
Said Alexander

"I accepted these risks. You haven't."

"I will accept any risk necessary to further humanity's progress."
Said Crystal

"...You sure? Your life's ahead of you."
Said Alexander

"...I..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire looks down again.

"I can do it. I know I can."
Said Crystal

"All I need is an idea, just to prove that they can make them."

vein of creations. For example, my Opus Magnum. I am, for the most part, an engineer. I focused mostly on

Crystal Saint Claire:

"But one day the idea came to me almost out of nowhere. I was concerned for my safety, and about my skill

protecting myself"

"And the idea came to me to make a pistol from Ghost Iron. Easier for someone of my

stature and strength to use."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"I think that, if manitous are capable of such things, the Opus Magnum was their work."

"...hum."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien crossed her arms.

"My hands, their ideas. The blueprints were my own, the conceptualization, the craft..."
Said Crystal

"But the spark, the idea... it was like lightning from a blue summer sky."

"So... to test this..."
Said Crystal

"I would make a list. Of ideas, as they came to me. And each one, regardless of content,

regardless of morality, would at least be written down."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Pare out the most dangerous, and the blatantly unethical..."
Said Crystal

"And then attempt to bring the rest to fruition."

"The key would be letting... someone... know I would be a blank slate for that period of time."

"That no idea would be shelved without inspection."

"An invitation, so to speak, to see what they could sneak into the world of the living."

"They come on their own terms. Or when challenged."

"Then I will have disproved a theory, which is just as useful."
Said Crystal

"Perhaps not against me, I am... informidable."

"But could one, in theory, inspire competition?"

"They would know more, then?"
Said Crystal

"I will ask about."

"You don't want a bloody shaman."
Said Cassie-May

UrbanCritter looks at Cassie.

"I do not believe we would find one this far from the Native lands."
Said Crystal

"... We'll need a huckster, then. They're rare-ish."
Said Alexander

"I will check the card circles!"
Said Crystal

"They typically frequent gambling dens, do they not?"

"Probably. Don't come in and yell for one. It'll take effort."
Said Alexander

"I have read about the subject"
Said Crystal

"All I need to do is be an obvious candidate for a scam or conniver"

"And someone of that ilk will find me, no?"

"Tha's generalizin' like holy heck."
Said Cassie-May

"...Kid."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald pinches the bridge of his nose.

"Just let me tag along. I could probably help."
Said Alexander

"I had assumed that was a given."
Said Crystal

"How 'bout we go see tha' Marshall business first. Lick o' luck an' them's gunna be a

Huckster there."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"That is fair."
Said Crystal

"YeahAlexander Hauswald:

"Yeah. Let's try that."

Cassie-May O'Brien coughed and finished her coffee.

"Welp. Let's git sum' breakfast in yew, Crystal."
Said Cassie-May

"Food would be nice."
Said Crystal

"Hsve fun, you two. I'm not hungry."
Said Alexander

"Bark bark!"
Said Sacks

"But Sacks is."
Said Alexander

"Aw shucks, y'all woulde let two pretty gals jus' wander 'round alone wit'out protection in

huge city like this?"

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"..."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald slowly gets up, stretching.

"Guess I'm coming."
Said Alexander

((Good night--aw he left)Crystal Saint Claire:

I'm still available, yes!Cassie-May O'Brien:

Give me a tick and I'll have something.

Just need some moosic.

(If you do end up giving out any Chips, though, you should give one to UrbanCritter too)Cassie-May O'Brien:

(With Alex, Sacks and Crystal, at the hotel they stayed in, after morning coffee and in

search of a breakfast.)

Cassie-May O'Brien:

(I am here)Crystal Saint Claire:

(And wanna do things

(If you can

(A trip would work better I think, since Alex would be present for the breakfast and it's sucky

to NPC players)

Cassie-May O'Brien:

The bell above the door makes a cling clang as Cassie and Crystal enter the general

store. The owner scrapes himself back to wakefulness in a few seconds. He glances to the two coming in the

more comfy position. The store is filled with all manner of useful items, provisions, cheap guns, cheap bullets,

hundred other things.

(It is however half past midnight. So if we're doing something it's gonna happen now- oh

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Howdy miss, if you're looking for anything specific, I can help. If you're browsing, then I

see no reason for me to interfere."

General Store Owner:

"Whut wuz it y'all wanted ta check out, Crystal?"
Said Cassie-May

"...something resistant. Cloth of some sort."
Said Crystal

"Something that would function well in a n armored vest..."

Cassie-May O'Brien just browses around for anything unusual and interesting, out of curiosity more than

need. Maybe a coffee maker she could use in the field comfortably? She was somewhat in a problem with

that lately.

"...food..."
Said Crystal

General Store Owner fishes a tin of indeterminate origin from a vest pocket. It is long and metal and the

label has long been worn off. He takes a thin paper and some dried stuff out of it.

"Oh! And a few decks of cards!"
Said Crystal

(Trail rations)Crystal Saint Claire:

(Roll scrounging or smarts if you're looking for something in all this mess.)General Store Owner:

Crystal Saint Claire:+04+0406

Cassie-May O'Brien:+02010

be nice..."

Crystal Saint Claire:

General Store Owner:

the mesh looks to be about two foot but four foot. Unless you've got a big ass coffee cup this is going to be

useless. Might be able to modify it though...

"...Hmm. Eeeyup."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien grabbed the strainer.

"How much fer tha'?"
Said Cassie-May

General Store Owner is lighting up his fresh rolled cigarillo as Cassie asks him the question. He takes two

puffs and blows a ring of smoke before replying.

"Half dollar for the gold sifter."
Said General

...Crystal Saint Claire:00

Crystal Saint Claire takes shirt and cards.

"May I buy these?"

Whitney is huge. The only thing you can make out of this shirt is something that will cover

her chest and most of the body above that. Significant, skillful alteration will be needed for even that.

General Store Owner:

"Sure kid. Twenty five for the deck and..."

General Store Owner examines the plaid on the shirt with obvious distaste.

"Ten cents for the shirt."
Said General

"Half a dollar? Kinda high, tha' thing's beat up fer heck."
Said Cassie-May

(Roll bluff or smarts at a penalty of five)General Store Owner:

Smarts thenCassie-May O'Brien:

"Do you have anything similar to tent canvas, or denim?"
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien:+0401

so that's a 9

General Store Owner squints over at the mesh strainer that Cassie is holding. He taps a finger on the

counter top for a couple seconds. The chair creaks as he leans back into it.

"Alright, thirty cent."
Said General

"Fahne."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien paid up.

"Should have some tents..."
Said General

General Store Owner takes the coinage from Cassie and stuffs it into the wooden drawer that serves as

the register.

"Now, how ta make it inta proper coffee strainer..."
Said Cassie-May

"With the lanterns and lantern oil and spikes and rock salt bucks."
Said General

"Standard camping supplies."

Crystal Saint Claire pays the man for the stuff she has

Crystal Saint Claire checkes for that stuff! Camping supplies!

Cassie-May O'Brien meanwhile just lets Crystal browse while she wonders how to make a gold strainer

into a coffeemaker.

Crystal Saint Claire also looks for anything cool that might inspire her next invention!0

And a journal!Crystal Saint Claire:

The promised lanterns are there, as is all manner of oil. The spikes are in a bucket next to

a bunch of rubber mallets. Canvas tents are stacked against the wall. There's a couple boxes of what looks to be

specialty shotgun shells next to the tents.

General Store Owner:

Crystal Saint Claire takes a look!

)brb)Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Sir, what are these?"
Said Crystal

"Wuss what?"
Said General

Crystal Saint Claire tries to bring him one of the boxes

"Oh, them's rock salt shells."
Said General

"For scaring off prairie ticks and other nonsense you find out in th' wild."

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire plunks two boxes on the counter

Crystal Saint Claire also gets a tent

General Store Owner looks over the boxes of shells and the tent for a few moments. His finger taps the

counter top with a rhythm that seems familiar, probably a song.

"Howsabout, two dollars for the lot?"
Said General

(How many vests could I make from this tent?)Crystal Saint Claire:

(Depends on who you're making it for.)General Store Owner:

HmmCrystal Saint Claire:

So one for whitney

And then enough for Sacks and Nephi!

(Should be.)General Store Owner:

plunkCrystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire plunks the tent on the counter.

"And this..."
Said Crystal

"Do you know where I could find someone skilled with gunsmithing?"

General Store Owner holds out a wrinkled hand and rubs his thumb and two fingers together. The

universal sign for 'dosh please.'

"I saw the tent in your hand. Two dollars, as I said."
Said General

"As for gun smithin'..."

"Oh, my apologies!"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire digs in her carpet bag and pulls out a small canvas sack.

"Vaquero down the street might know something."
Said General

Crystal Saint Claire rummages around

"He's more into firearms than I am."
Said General

Crystal Saint Claire finds 2 dollars, and hands them to the Store Owner.

"And... anyone skilled in metallurgy?"
Said Crystal

"...a blacksmith."

"I need to find a blacksmith."

General Store Owner takes the two dollars and slides them into the register.

"I may not be partial to five dollar words, but I do ken the meaning."
Said General

"Thank you sir!"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire looks around for Cassie.

General Store Owner scratches at his chin scruff as he smokes and thinks.

Crystal Saint Claire is considering asking the General Store Owner about any Hucksters in the area...

"Metalworker..."
Said General

Crystal Saint Claire opens the deck of cards in the meanwhile!

"Think there's an Eli Drummond on South street. 'Cross the railroad tracks."
Said General

"Think he does some work fabbin' parts for special orders."

"The Vaquero down the street about guns, Eli Drummond on south street across the tracks

for metals..."

Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire shifts, unable to find Cassie.

"What's eatin' atcha?"
Said General

"I was wondering... if you might know anywhere I could find information about occult

phenomena... For research. Anyone who knows about that sort of thing, or perhaps a library..."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Dunno 'bout that stuff meself."
Said General

"I'd ask barkeep about it."

"They keep their ears open, and a man talks a lot when he's liquored up to his eyeballs."

"Thank you sir."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire looks for something to buy to thank the man for his troubles, because just sliding

someone money is sometimes illegal and often insulting

(Roll smarts for me again.)General Store Owner:

Crystal Saint Claire:+09+0806

You locate an old hat underneath a pile of belts. It looks to be a collapsible top hat

with...thirteen bullet holes in it.

General Store Owner:

...Crystal Saint Claire:

This is SO COOL

Crystal Saint Claire plops it on the counter

"...may I buy this?"
Said Crystal

"Why are there bullet holes in it?"

"Yes."
Said General

"...it is still a nice hat."
Said Crystal

bkCassie-May O'Brien:

"I imagine the bullet holes are there because the stupid bastard I won it off had a habit of

getting in duels."

General Store Owner:

"He was a dwarf though."

"Most folks are used to shooting for the guts on a regular sized fella."

"Ah."
Said Crystal

"How much would you like for it?"

Cassie-May O'Brien just observed with a smirk

General Store Owner holds his chin in a way that makes his wrinkles look almost comically deep.

"Dollar an' ten."
Said General

me nods.Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire nods

"...I do not have change..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire hands him another two dollars.

General Store Owner takes the money and shoves it into the register. He roots around in the drawer for a

minute or two. The General Store Owner comes back with a couple of coins. He drops them onto Crystal's

section of the countertop. Looks to be four dimes and a half dollar.

"Ah think tha's way too much fer a holey top hat, fella."Cassie-May O'Brien:0

"Collapsible top hat won off a dwarf in a poker game."
Said General

"Ain't just a hat."

"Ain' too lucky then if y'all won it off him."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire whispers something to Cassie

Cassie-May O'Brien raises her eyebrow

"You wanna play a hand and see how good I am?"
Said General

"Sure!"
Said Crystal

"Or are yo-"
Said General

General Store Owner scrapes his hand across his face.

"Alright."
Said General

"...I am always up for learning new things! I am not great at poker, the University frowned

upon such things..."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"But my uncle taught me the basics. This hand better than that hand, et cetera..."

"It would be good to learn from someone more skilled than I!"

"Right, mind handing me that deck of cards you got?"
Said General

Crystal Saint Claire holds the deck out to the GSO.

General Store Owner takes the deck and cuts it in half before riffling it back together.

Crystal Saint Claire watches

"This is a new deck, correct?"
Said Crystal

"Should be, seal was still on it."
Said General

"Mind if Ah shuffle it mahself?"
Said Cassie-May

"You a huckster?"
Said General

"Faaaaar from it."
Said Cassie-May

"I am not a huckster! Should I shufle the cards, as a third party both individuals believe to be

bad at cheating?"

Crystal Saint Claire:

"...that is how it works, is it not?"

"Whoever is worst at cheating shuffles?"

General Store Owner runs his eyeballs over Cassie. He gives the deck of cards to Crystal.

"Go ahead."
Said General

Crystal Saint Claire shuffles. She can't do it quite as fancily, but her hands are steady.

She still has to do it with the cards on the table.Crystal Saint Claire:

"Ah sure like when no one's trustin' each other over them game of cards. Keeps it nice an'

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"You look like you're a weathered cuss."
Said General

"Take it as a compliment."

"Ate bread from many ovens, Ah dun'."
Said Cassie-May

"Of course! You can always trust someone who lies to lie to you, so it's jsut as easy as

expecting the truth. Statistically, people who identify as honest are harder to trust, because when they do lie they

ofte get away with it!"

Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire places the shuffled deck on the table.

"The cards are shuffled!"
Said Crystal

"Would anyone like to do the thing where they pick up half the deck and put the bottom on the top?"

General Store Owner takes the deck and deals cards for Hold 'Em.

"I imagine the decks pretty well shuffled, shouldn't need to cut it."
Said General

Cassie-May O'Brien took a glance at her cards.

"Bettin' anything?"
Said General

"Mmm. Ah wuz wonderin' if we're all playin' jus' fer Crystal's sake here or makin' it

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"What are the stakes? Typically we would play for money..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire takes out a dollar. "Would this be adequate, for a simple, friendly game?"

"I am unfamiliar with gambling etiquette."
Said Crystal

"That'd be more than ad-eck-wit."
Said General

"Sorry. I will try to stop using expensive words."
Said Crystal

General Store Owner slides open the register and takes out a dollar to place in the pot.

"No problem with me, but some folks don't take too kindly to it."
Said General

"Miss Doubtful?"

"Ain' got a problem wit' it."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien passes her own dollar onto the table.

"I will try to speak simply, then."
Said Crystal

"Speak to suit yourself and the situation."
Said General

General Store Owner deals the river.

"Oooh. Ah'm feelin' good 'bout this."
Said Cassie-May

(PAY NO ATTENTION TO ME ACCIDENTALLY GRABBING THE TITLE SCREEN)General Store Owner:

"So we... bet, or... check... or raise?"
Said Crystal

"Right, then when that's finished I deal another card."
Said General

"Very well."
Said Crystal

"Think Ah'm gunna raise up a dollar."
Said Cassie-May

"I'll call yer bluff."
Said General

Cassie-May O'Brien grinned.

"I will, as well! Even if this is expensive, it will be educational. And still cheaper than MIT."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire digs out another dollar... then another!

"I will raise."
Said Crystal

"Yer sayin' it's MITe expensive?"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien snickered.

General Store Owner grumbles something under his breath, then slaps down another dollar.

"Did I do something wrong, sir?"
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien puts the third dollar down.

"Naw, he's got a crummy hand."
Said Cassie-May

"But he is remaining in."
Said Crystal

"Naw, just not used to playin' for this much."
Said General

"I apologize..."
Said Crystal

"S'fine."
Said General

"Perhaps we should simply use chips for now..."
Said Crystal

"Ain' often makin' high stakes mahself, but Ah reckon' Crystal 'ere coulde use sum' lesson

rough on th' pocket."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"This'll be fine kid."
Said General

"New round of bettin'."

"Welp, anyun' raisin from three dollars?"
Said Cassie-May

"I will not raise, no."
Said Crystal

General Store Owner eyes Cassie as he takes out five dollars from the register and places them in the pot.

He does so with inexorable slowness.

lose whut yer put in so far, but nothin' more."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Called foldin'."
Said General

"Realleh? Huh. HEard it called passin' where Ah come from."
Said Cassie-May

"So I can call, raise, or fold?"
Said Crystal

"Thas right."
Said General

Crystal Saint Claire digs in her little bag

Crystal Saint Claire puts down ten dollars, grinning.

"Raise."
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien leaned over the table, her breasts pressing down and cleavage bulging out from

between the partially unbuttoned shirt.

"Is this where the term "upping the ante" came from?"
Said Crystal

General Store Owner eyes widen at the new size of the pot. He does not take any particular notice of

Cassie's boobs.

"No, this is the pot, not the ante..."
Said Crystal

"Don't ask meh, sugercube. Ah hav' naw idea where she dun' git all tha' moeny from."
Said Cassie-May

General Store Owner digs out five more dollars and puts it in the pot.

Cassie-May O'Brien pushes ten more dollars out of her purse.

"Thirteen each. Now them stakeCassie-May O'Brien:

Crystal Saint Claire:

"She might want to keep a better handle on that money."
Said General

Crystal Saint Claire puts the bag back in her carpet bag.

"Welp, sugercube. Believe it's tahme fer th' last card."
Said Cassie-May

"Okay!"
Said Crystal

General Store Owner matches the current minimum bet to call.

General Store Owner deals the last card.

"'Nother round of bets or lay down hands?"
Said General

Crystal Saint Claire stretches, the sleeves of her lab coat falling lack to her elbows.

"I think we should put the cards down, before anyone loses any more money."
Said Crystal

"Eeeyup."
Said Cassie-May

"Good thinkin'."
Said General

"Gents first?"
Said Cassie-May

"Is there typically an order?"
Said Crystal

General Store Owner lays down a Jack of clubs and an eight of clubs.

"...oh."
Said Crystal

"Eeeyup."
Said Cassie-May

"Lessee what you two got."
Said General

"..."
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien threw her two fours on the table with a chuckle.

"I would like to take this moment to remind Cassie that I am not a huckster"
Said Crystal

"Ah wuz bluffin' out mah keister here."
Said Cassie-May

"I was not."
Said Crystal

"This is a flush, correct?"

"...Five a' color."
Said Cassie-May

"Darn y'all."

"I thought it was five of a suit?"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire smiles a little.

"Whutever y'all wanna call it, yer won this un'."
Said Cassie-May

General Store Owner looks over the two hands present. He smiles at Crystal's for a moment before

pushing the pile of cash over to her side of the counter top.

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire pushes three dollars back

"Teacher's fee."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire stuffs the rest in her bag.

"She got class, gotta admit."
Said Cassie-May

"Thank you kindly Miss."
Said General

Poage was giggling like a moron the whle time

Cassie-May O'Brien sighed, feeling her pockets' contents halved.

"..."
Said Crystal

"You two want to try another hand?"
Said General

"Cassie are you okay?"
Said Crystal

"So tha's how Ah lost thirteen dollars. Eeeyup, but yer buyin' meh dinner, sugercube."
Said Cassie-May

"I think the important part is to quit while you have made money, is it not?"
Said Crystal

"What would you like?"

"Tis a good lesson to learn."
Said General

Poage would like to take a moment to note

"The priciest steak y'all have in this town."
Said Cassie-May

I got ten and changeCassie-May O'Brien:

Inside another bag.

Most of it is tens

But she has 20 in ones

"That'd be up at the Fenwick hotel."
Said General

"Fenwick hotel it is! C'mawn, Crystal."
Said Cassie-May

"I didn't catch your name sir"

"There's a gunsmith"

"And... a blacksmith"

"Bean, Jack Bean."
Said General

"And... the bar. The hotel probably has one of those."
Said Crystal

"Ah'm sure them are, sugercube. Ah ain' leavin' yew until Ah git mah steak though!"
Said Cassie-May

"Thank you, Mister Bean!"
Said Crystal

"Welcome."
Said General

"I will not forget the lesson!"
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien offered the store owner her hand.

"Tha wuz' fun, mistah Bean."
Said Cassie-May

General Store Owner slides the cards back into the packet and closes it up. He hands it to Crystal with a

neat little flourish of his arm.

"Was a pleasure."
Said General

Crystal Saint Claire accepts them, smiling sincerely for.. the first time in a while, towards a man.

You SHOULD HAVE NAMED HIM JAMES BEAN(From Crystal Saint Claire):

REEEEEE(From Crystal Saint Claire):

That's one of his brothers.(To Poage):

Is this the same guy that is a Mantiou from Alex's card game?(From Crystal Saint Claire):

If so, Alex is gonna fucking LOVE this(From Crystal Saint Claire):

That'd be difficult to determine. Though if you could find someone with a lot of faith or spirit...(To Poage):

WHITNEY(From Crystal Saint Claire):

Both of you take a big old red chip.General Store Owner:

Cassie-May O'Brien realizes her hand's shaking. She grunts in annoyance and grips her wrist with the

"Consarn it..."
Said Cassie-May

Crystal is gonna bring Whitney to meet Mr. Bean, who taught her how to not lose at

poker and also sold her canvas for the tent and rock salt shells and is a nice man.

(From Crystal Saint Claire):

"Cassie?"
Said Crystal

"Problem?"
Said General

"Are you okay?"
Said Crystal

"Eh, jus' a bit too much excitement. Don'cha werry 'bout it."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien quickly hid her hands in pockets.

"It is when I am told not to worry that I worry the most. We can discuss this over dinner.

Thank you for your help, Mr. Bean."

Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire leads Cassie out with... surprising steadiness for one her age.

"Darn, looks like mah steak's gunne come wit' lecturin'. Hey, hey, Ah can walk jus' fahne...!"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien is led out.

General Store Owner tips his hat to both of them. He throws his legs up onto the counter as they go out

the door and tugs his hat down over his eyes.

(Anything else?)General Store Owner:

and gunsmithCassie-May O'Brien:

And maybe a thing with Whitney if Yuppo is up for itCrystal Saint Claire:

and blacksimthCassie-May O'Brien:

And gunsmith and Mettalrgy and bar!Crystal Saint Claire:

Just... Whatever you're up to!

I have the gunsmith.General Store Owner:

And I can make the diner fellow easily enough.General Store Owner:

Pick one of those.

The other one might take me a bit.

The dice shall decide!Crystal Saint Claire:

I'm fine with doing the diner some other time

Crystal Saint Claire:

Smith it is

Which one is that.General Store Owner:

The GunsmithCrystal Saint Claire:

the Vaquero

Righto.General Store Owner:

You can see the belts of ammunition, the pistols, the shotguns, and the rifles from outside. You can

hear some music that sounds like it's being played by a gramophone somewhere deep in the store. You can see

the man at the counter looks like Pancho Villa. What is not certain from the outside is the overpowering odor of

Gun Runner:

"WELCOME AMIGOS!"

"Sh-"
Said Cassie-May

"I see you are very fine tasted, very discerning pair of gringos."
Said Gun

Crystal Saint Claire sighs.

"Before you say anything else."
Said Crystal

"This is so many guns."

"It is gun shop."
Said Gun

"I don't sell cheese."

"Why would you sell cheese?"
Said Crystal

"Cheese is good."
Said Gun

"Oh, right! Would you look at my gun?"
Said Crystal

"Keeps long time."
Said Gun

Crystal Saint Claire is, for a reminder, 15.

Cassie-May O'Brien decides to check if there's brennekas aka slugs for shotgun.

Gun Runner peers down at Crystal from his counter. It has several tiny Mexican flags sticking out of it.

The flagpoles are bullets.

"As long as it is invisible."
Said Gun

"Not invisible."

"It is my bag."
Said Crystal

"Your bag is a gun?"
Said Gun

Crystal Saint Claire reaches into the bag really slowly.

"No, the gun is..."
Said Crystal

Cassie.Gun Runner:

"Oh, here it is!"
Said Crystal

There are piles and piles of shells.Gun Runner:

Some are in boxes of twenty.

Some are in a glass case with nameplates underneath them.

Cassie-May O'Brien checks if all of those are shot, or any slugs.

There are a good many slugs amongst them.Gun Runner:

Crystal Saint Claire slowly pulls out the gun.

If you want to look for something specific, make a smarts roll.Gun Runner:

"Please be careful. It is not loaded, but one should treat guns like they're loaded unless

you're in a gunfight. Then you treat an empty gun like an empty gun."

Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire looks at the bullets with nameplates!

Cassie gathers up...

"Si, Si, let me take a look at it."
Said Gun

"I made it myself, and was wondering if a professional like you could give me any advice."
Said Crystal

That should be $2, same as 20 shotshells, yes?Cassie-May O'Brien:

Slugs are a little more specialty than regular shot, but here, two dollars should cover it.Gun Runner:

"I will see what I can see."

"Would Ah git a discount if Ah traded yew sum' of mah buckshot shells fer those?"
Said Cassie-May

"Some of..."
Said Gun

Gun Runner looks up from Crystal to Cassie.

"I can give you credit."
Said Gun

"Long as the shells are good."

"Them are. Whut can Ah git fer 40 of them?"
Said Cassie-May

"Forty shells of what gauge?"
Said Gun

"Twelvers."
Said Cassie-May

Gun Runner takes the gun from Crystal as he talks to Cassie. He gives it the hairy eyeball from every

"Can give you two dollar fifty cent in credit."
Said Gun

"How 'bout we jus' trade forty shotshells fer twenny slugs? Think yer makin' a profit there

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"You should not lick that, sir"
Said Crystal

Gun Runner shuffles around behind the counter for a minute before emerging with a box of bullets. He

loads up the cylinder of Crystal's revolver in about ten seconds.

"Fine with me compadre."
Said Gun

"Keep head away from target for couple of seconds."

Cassie-May O'Brien nods.

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Works fer meh."

Crystal Saint Claire plugs her ears

Cassie-May O'Brien removes 40 shotshells and adds 20 slug shells

Gun Runner holds the pistol up and fires it across the room at a set of metal targets. Behind the targets

are sandbags. Behind the sandbags is a thick oak wall.

The Opus Magnum is a 9-shot revolverCrystal Saint Claire:

and also a shotgun

Gun Runner walks out from behind the counter and grabs a shotgun shell from Cassie.

"Let me see about this..."
Said Gun

(Spearate pieceCrystal Saint Claire:

Gun Runner picks out the two used cartridges from the gun's cylinder and empties the still good ones

into a pocket on his poncho.

Gun Runner pops in a shotgun shell.

Gun Runner adopts a shooting stance and holds his shooting hand with his free hand.

Gun Runner pops the expended shell out and juggles it in his hand as it cools.

"Everything seems to be in order senorita."
Said Gun

Gun Runner trots back behind the counter and lays the gun on the table.

"Anything special you want worked on?"
Said Gun

I RETURN.

Crystal Saint Claire is looking at the bullets with the nameplates

"I... do have an idea about something."
Said Crystal

"But it is a bit odd, and still young."

Crystal Saint Claire reaches into her bag and pulls out a little notebook!

"I had the idea talking with a friend."
Said Crystal

There's a few named after peppers. Jalepeno, Habenro, and Ghost. A couple for really huge guns.

There is also one called, "Tequila Special."

Gun Runner:

"The small, mounted shotgun. With the proper work, could something like that be mounted

on a rifle?"

Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire points at the Magic Boolits

Which magic Boolits?Gun Runner:

Gun Runner whips out a pair of coke bottle spectacles and hooks the arms behind his ears.

"Si, si..."
Said Gun

"It can be done, but the weight would be something to consider senorita."

"The attachment might throw off aim if you do not have the..."

Gun Runner holds up his arms in a classic bodybuilder pose.

"The big guns, chu know?"
Said Gun

The ones named after peppersCrystal Saint Claire:

TESTGun Runner:

"Dos are the..."

"Fire bullets, chu know?"

"I keep a couple different flavors in stock."

"The Jalepeno, she is spicy, but not too bad."

"For if you worry about price, or collateral damage."

"Habenero is a little more powerful."
Said Gun

"De Ghost is for when you need some cabron really dead, no question 'bout it."
Said Gun

They are for shotguns.

The Tequila Special comes only in .44.Gun Runner:

"And what is this one?"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire points at the Tequila Special

The Jalepeno is ten dollars a box. The habenero is fifty.Gun Runner:

The Ghost is a hundred...

Imagine all those had quotation marks around them.

Gun Runner leans over the counter towards Crystal.

"Per. Shot."
Said Gun

"..."
Said Crystal

"That sounds utterly terrifying."

"It is."
Said Gun

"Have to order them special from Deseret."

"Do you have anything that would prevent me from grabbing a Ghost if I needed to reload,

and was grabbing at shells at random?"

Crystal Saint Claire:

"You can tell when you grab one of those."
Said Gun

"How?"
Said Crystal

"It burns hand."
Said Gun

"Comes in special case for each shot."

"...that does sound potent."
Said Crystal

"You want to know about Tequila Special too?"
Said Gun

"Yes, please!"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire is taking notes

"Is special order from one of dose wops does work on railroad."
Said Gun

"Makes doves happen."

"Thirty dollar for thirty shot box."

"Doves?"
Said Crystal

"Si, doves."
Said Gun

"The birds?"
Said Crystal

"Si."
Said Gun

"De birds."

"...So if I fire my gun, birds come out?"
Said Crystal

"Sometimes come out of gun."
Said Gun

"Sometimes come out of where bullet hits."

"Sometimes just fly out of..."

"No tell where."

"Lots of trickshot like to use it."

"Very flash."

"Oh."
Said Crystal

"..how many shells in a box of Jalepenos?"

"Fifteen."
Said Gun

"Same for Habaneros?"
Said Crystal

"No, ten in Habenero box."
Said Gun

Oh.Crystal Saint Claire:

"You want to buy any ammo?"
Said Gun

"Yes please!"
Said Crystal

"One box Jalepenos, one Habaneros, and one Ghost!"

Crystal Saint Claire nods.

"That will be one hundred and sixty din-"
Said Gun

Crystal Saint Claire digs in her carpet bag.

Gun Runner taps himself on the head a few times.

"Dollars."
Said Gun

"Okay!"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire hands him the money.

"Thank you so much... These will probably save my friends at least once, sir."
Said Crystal

Gun Runner takes the FAT WAD of cash and shoves it into an iron safe behind the counter.

"You are welcome tiny senorita."
Said Gun

"...would you mind not telling anyone I came in here?"
Said Crystal

"If someone learns I have something like the Ghost, my things may go missing..."

Gun Runner takes out a box of fifteen shot, ten shot, and one shot from under the counter.

"Two rules for Ghost."
Said Gun

"Do not shoot in store."

"Do not shoot in town."

"If want me to keep tight lip about you coming in here..."

Gun Runner rubs two fingers and a thumb together in the universal sign for 'more currency needed.'

"I will not shoot this near any buildings."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire sighs.

"How much? I have limited funding, at this point."
Said Crystal

"Five dollar."
Said Gun

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire digs in her bag, placing the boxes of ammo in there.

Crystal Saint Claire gives him five dollars.

Gun Runner takes the bills, kisses them, and tucks them into a pocket on his poncho.

"Oh, and would you like some of these shells?"
Said Crystal

"Since when did you come into store young senorita?"
Said Gun

Crystal Saint Claire holds a box of the Rocksalt shells

"Did not even hear bell ring."
Said Gun

Gun Runner eyeballs the rock salt shells for a moment.

"No, is for farmers and campers."
Said Gun

"This is store for things that kill."

"Very well! I thought I would ask, since you have done so much for me..."
Said Crystal

"Thank you sir!"

Crystal Saint Claire leaves with Cassie, after Cassie gets what she wants.

"See you later big spender senortia!"
Said Gun

The mariachi music fades with the smell of gun oil as Cassie and Crystal leave the

After a magical mystical shopping adventure filled with poker and peril, Crystal gets back to the saloon. Whitney is

in the room she shares with Crystal doing...something. It is assumedly religious, or vegetarian.

Vegan.

Though there is some overlap between the two.

Crystal Saint Claire knocks on the door!

"Yes yes! Come in!"Whitney G. Elieen:0

Whitney G. Elieen calls out

Crystal Saint Claire pushes the door open, her carpet bag over her back.

"Hello, Whitney! Today has been a wonderful adventure!"
Said Crystal

"I have forgotten to purchase a needle and thread."

>Pushes the door open

No.

I just had a wonderful idea.

God DAMNITCrystal Saint Claire:

That was for someone else, wasn't it

It wasn't Crystal running the seinfeld theme was it?

Thought it was Whitney

You got seinfelded.

Continue please.

OkCrystal Saint Claire:

I just wanted to meme for a moment.

"Would you please come with me to the General Store, to get some? I... am comfortable

with the owner, but I am unsure about the streets at this time..."

Crystal Saint Claire:

Whitney G. Elieen smiles at you as she looks up from the side of her bed. Bible laying right there on the

a space like this for long."

Whitney G. Elieen:

Crystal Saint Claire smiles!

"Thank you! I have the Opus, if something very bad happens, but... I would rather not use it

in town."

Crystal Saint Claire:

For God's sake tell me you did not load it with the Ghost round.

...It's got a Jalepeno in right now.

Crystal Saint Claire unpacks some things. A few boxes of ammunition, two with peppers on them and one

with a spooky ghost that also looks a little like a pepper. A shirt, much too large for her, butt too sall for

A tent. A deck of cards.Crystal Saint Claire:

And two more ammo boxes.

"Would you like to go now, or finish up whatever you were doing?"

"You have been very busy it seems..."
Said Whitney

"No no it is fine. I am finished with my prayers for now."

"I bought some of our friends gifts..."
Said Crystal

"Especially Callie as an apology for beating her at poker."
Said Crystal

Cassie

I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS TROUBLE WITH IT.

oopsCrystal Saint Claire:

"Beat her at the great game of chance have you?"
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen says as she rises to her full height

"They were teaching me how to play and I got a little caught up in it and I accidentally made

twenty dollars"

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Twenty dollars...praise be that is a considerable sum."
Said Whitney

"You have been very blessed indeed...so we are going to meet this one?"

"So I spent it helping them"
Said Crystal

"But anyway General Store!"

"Yes ma'am! To pick up some thread, a needle..."

"Possible some emergency food, in case of emergencies..."

"Very good thinking. There is a saying that the lord works in those who help themselves."
Said Whitney

"Come then"

"Let us be tools of his divine will."

Whitney and Crystal head out onto the streets, bound for the General Store. The night

is vast and unlit, save for the scattered windows of night owls burning midnight oil.

(To GM) rolling 1d20

There is a tiny figure peering in one of the windows. He looks to be wrapped in

bandages. There is a small revolver with a stock attached to it on his back. On the little figure the gun looks like a

rifle. He does not notice Whitney or Crystal. He is transfixed by the light from the window.

"A calm, peaceful night we have been blessed with..."Whitney G. Elieen:0

"A treasure in and of itself."

The tiny figure turns to Whitney. All she can see of his face is one big, red eye.

"Have you seen my dad?"
Said Lil

"...your father. In fact you do seem very familar..."
Said Whitney

"Your father, God bless him, chose a immoral path and was made to face the judgement of man. He is with the

lawmen now."

"You've seen my dad?"
Said Lil

"My dad..."

"He does what he has to do."

"He's not a bad man."

"I hold no hatred in my heart for him. For that is what is commanded of me by my Lord. Bad

man or not he has raised his sword against us with the intention to steal and maim."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"The fruits of sin are bitter indeed."

"But...he just wants to take care of me."
Said Lil

"That's all he wanted to do."

"He couldn't get a job after mom."

"Mom died."

"He had to take stuff from other people."

"The law cares not for intent."
Said Crystal

"It has not been long enough for a proper trial to be arranged... Perhaps, if we ask nicely... They will at least let his

son in?"

Crystal Saint Claire thinks about something.

"...God is a just God. But he is also a merciful one. Maybe an act of mercy and kindness will

change his heart and set him upon the right path."

Whitney G. Elieen:

Crystal Saint Claire turns to Lil'Big.

"How old are you."
Said Crystal

"I'm ten."
Said Lil

"Don't forget it."

"'M big enuff to lick both of you."

"It is not me you need to worry about."
Said Whitney

He comes up to Whitney's knee.

Whitney G. Elieen says with a chuckle

"Me, certainly. Provided you could draw before I did."
Said Crystal

"Or... survive a Jalepeno shell at this range."

"I would rather not, though."

"...You are too young to not have parents."

"I will not allow it."

Crystal Saint Claire turns to Whitney. "Do you think the Marshall would be angry if I deputized his father?"

(I may go to bed in a second.)

"Not the Marshall's father, his."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire points at Lil' Big.

(Sure.)Crystal Saint Claire:

(Certainly. I am free tomorrow!)Whitney G. Elieen:

(As am I.)Crystal Saint Claire:

Whitney G. Elieen shakes her head. "I know little of the laws of Man. The Lawmen among us may prove

better to ask. But I agree that a child should never grow up without their parents."

"It is...hell. On earth. Lord willing we will see what we can do."
Said Whitney

"It would get him a job, would it not?"
Said Crystal

I'm always fine.

Unless I'm not.

Which is the case sometimes.

"I..."
Said Lil

Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit takes the pistol off his back and holds it in his arms for a moment, tapping

the attached stock to help his thought process.

"Can I...stay with you guys for a while?"
Said Lil

I mean

"I would not object."
Said Crystal

"You may stay with us yes."
Said Whitney

"You two seem like good peoples."
Said Lil

"We will be doing dangerous work."
Said Crystal

"Marshall things."

"Is that acceptable?"

"I'm good at dangerous."
Said Lil

"Wonderful! Then I shall hire you!"
Said Crystal

Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit snaps the stock of the pistol against his shoulder and attempts to look

"That way nobody can complain if you come everywhere with me."
Said Crystal

"Bam, bam, thank you ma'mm."
Said Lil

Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit slides the gun onto his back again and stands on his bandaged feet for a

while. He rocks back and forth to get his mind working.

"So...what's your names?"
Said Lil

"How are you with that pistol?"
Said Crystal

"I'm good, real good."
Said Lil

"Pa bought it for me special and made me shoot at targets every day."

"How adorable! I am Whitney by the way. Whitney Gould Elieen. This is my dear friend

Whitney G. Elieen:

"You may call me whatever you wish. My name is Crystal Saint-Claire."
Said Crystal

"Cool, my name's Junior."
Said Lil

"You wanna see me shoot at somethin'?"

"Perhaps something mundane...a bottle?"
Said Whitney

"Okey doke."
Said Lil

"What ammunition does the gun take."
Said Crystal

"We may be able to field test some things!"

Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit takes the pistol off his back and jams the stock to his shoulder. He lines the

sights up with an empty bottle of whiskey on a deserted bench. It is close to invisible in the dark. The little

guy fires.

Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit:+07+07

There are tinkling noises of glass shards coming to a rest as the sound of the gunshot fades.

"Splendid work! God has blessed you with a steady aim."
Said Whitney

"Who's that?"
Said Lil

looks to be a standard Colt Peacemaker chambered for .45 ammunition.

"Have you never heard the word of God before?"
Said Whitney

"Jesus Christ?"

"I heard some peoples talk about those guys, but I never got to hear nothin' about

"Well my child...I am happy to tell you all that I can of the Lord our God and spread the good

news to you." She says with the widest smile. "He is my master. My father. My protector and our savior."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Sounds nice."
Said Lil

"What are you two doing out here though?"

"It's dark."

"Are you spyin'?"

"I forgot to buy a needle, and thread."
Said Crystal

"Yes. I am giving my friend company as she makes her necessary purchases."
Said Whitney

"Fun!"
Said Lil

"I love going to stores."00000

"Mr. Beans is nice. I like him."
Said Crystal

"Specially ones that have peppermint sticks."
Said Lil

"Who's Mister Beans?"

"The man who owns the... it's Bean, not Beans. Apologies."
Said Crystal

"Oh, okay."
Said Lil

"We should get going then."

"It's important to go to bed on time."

"Dad always said so."

"Whitney says the same thing"
Said Crystal

"Yes. It is important to maintain consistency when it comes to your sleep."
Said Whitney

"It is more important than many give it credit for"

"I said I was sorry..."
Said Crystal

"And so often it is ignored in our secular society."
Said Whitney

"So! To the general store!"
Said Crystal

"Yes. With haste~"
Said Whitney

"To peppermint sticks!"
Said Lil

The newly minted band of three make their way to the General Store. There is a little

light shining through the windows, but not much. Walking through the door sets off a jingling bell mounted above it.

The tall, lanky store owner turns from where he is examining his stock to face the newcomers. He holds a lit

lantern in one hand and a pad of paper in the other. The pad is covered with neat handwriting. He holds the

lantern up and squints for a second before recognition dawns.

"What are you doing back so late kid?"
Said General

"And with, new friends."

"I forgot a few supplies, sir."
Said Crystal

General Store Owner eyeballs Whitney for a few moments.

"This is Whitney!"
Said Crystal

"She looks like a bull hunting a china shop."
Said General

"She is very gentle!"
Said Crystal

"I'm sure she is."
Said General

"I'll be taking inventory if you need me."

Whitney G. Elieen smiles and waves

General Store Owner waves back at Whitney with the arm holding the paper pad.

Whitney, this fella has a peculiar air about him.

A peculiar air you say?Whitney G. Elieen:

The Cards are still not working proper.

"Do you know where we would find sewing supplies, Mr. Bean? I am trying to stitch together

a vest for Whitney. Something armored."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Couple shelves back that way. Should have a lot of bright colored thread spools on the

middle rack. Can't miss it."

General Store Owner:

"Thank you, sir!"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire scampers off to look.

is Junior shorter than Crystal, or is she still kinda stunted?(From Crystal Saint Claire):

General Store Owner plunks his lantern down onto a nearby rack and scribbles something down on his

paper pad.

Whitney G. Elieen walks forward towards the store owner

Whitney G. Elieen walks forward slowly with her arm stretched outward.

Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit follows Crystal's petticoat tails.

General Store Owner turns to look at Whitney's hand on his shoulder.

Crystal Saint Claire turns over to Whitney and the owner. "Mr. Bean, do you have a ladder or stool I could

"I feel the hand of God guide me to you...to what purpose though I can not comprehend."
Said Whitney

"Oh."
Said General

"Perhaps his plan will be revealed to me...in time."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen slowly takes her hand off of his shoulder.

"That's...mighty interestin'."
Said General

General Store Owner cocks his head towards Crystal's voice.

"Should be..."
Said General

"Behin' the counter."

Crystal Saint Claire goes to check.

"You can go back there, just don't steal nothin'."
Said General

"Thank you, sir!"
Said Crystal

"Welcome."
Said General

General Store Owner turns back to Whitney.

Crystal Saint Claire finds the stepladder!

"Junior I found the ladder!"
Said Crystal

"What sort a godbotherer are you?"
Said General

Crystal Saint Claire carries it back to the shelf for thread with some difficulty.

Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit walks around a set of shelves with a peppermint stick held in his bandaged

"Where did you find that?"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire climbs up to find thread.

"Whitney what color do you like?"

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Ah, great! I should purchase a few."
Said Crystal

"I wonder if Whitney would like them..."

"Hmmm..."
Said General

General Store Owner takes out a tin and removes cigarillo rolling supplies from it.

"Heard 'bout them before, met a few too."
Said General

"Whitney what color!"
Said Crystal

"They have green, yellow, blue, red, black, white... What color is this? It's not quite blue, but not green..."

"We are few...but we speak and live true."
Said Whitney

General Store Owner uses deft fingers to roll up the tobacco in the paper. He gives it a twist to seal it off

and picks up the lantern cover.

"White please. White or...green now that you mention it."
Said Whitney

"I am fond of green."

"White and green! No problem!"
Said Crystal

Crystal is much less formal speaking with Whitney than anyone else. Am I doing

well in conveying this?

(From Crystal Saint Claire):

"They do seem to be nice folk."
Said General

Pretty well, yes.(To Poage):

General Store Owner lights the cigarillo and pops it into his mouth.

"She don't seem like the Adventist type."

"We met on our travels here actually. As the Lord would have it I have been given the chance

to have company on the train."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"A match made in heaven as they say. In the short time we have known one another she has become a fast friend

of mine."

Crystal Saint Claire walks up to the counter, her eyes about level with the flat surface.

Crystal Saint Claire puts the spools on the counter.

"Junior, the other thread?"
Said Crystal

General Store Owner takes the cigarillo out from betwixt his lips and holds it in his hand. His jaw drops

down and his lips part to fire a ring of smoke off to the left of Whitney's head.

"She's a sweetheart."
Said General

Crystal Saint Claire seems not to realize that they're talking about her.

Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit holds up the thread spools to Crystal.

"Thank you."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire places them on the counter as well.000000

"I am afraid not...I try to keep away from sugar."
Said Whitney

Said Crystal

Said Whitney

General Store Owner sticks the cigarillo back in his lips and picks up the lantern. He lopes back on over

to the counter and is behind it in a few seconds.

Does Junior have a Hankerin/Cravin for Peppermint Sticks?(From Crystal Saint Claire):

He is fond of them, that's about it. He'll be pretty happy if he does get peppermint sticks though.(To Poage):

"What d'ye got for me kid?"
Said General

"Some thread... And possibly peppermint Sticks. Junior likes them, and we're going to be on

a trip. So an emergency supply would be handy."

Crystal Saint Claire:

(I will be right back. Feel free to continue)Whitney G. Elieen:

"Alright, you want a needle to go with that thread?"
Said General

"...yes please."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire completely forgot about the needle.

"And... anything else necessary for sewing."
Said Crystal

"I'll get you a kit."
Said General

"Thank you so much."
Said Crystal

General Store Owner trots back out from behind the counter and to the aisle where Crystal was a few

minutes ago. He squints at the array of supplies on the shelves before snatching a leather pouch off the

"Awright."
Said General

General Store Owner slips behind the counter again and slides the pouch onto the countertop.

"Should be everythin' you need for sewing most anything in there."
Said General

"'Cept the thread."

"That gonna be satisfactory?"

"That will be perfect!"
Said Crystal

General Store Owner takes a drag on his cigarillo and puffs out a bit more smoke.

"Good, good."
Said General

General Store Owner does some quick arithmetic in his head. He counts out a few numbers on his fingers

and taps on the counter twice.

"Three seventy five alright with you?"
Said General

Crystal Saint Claire thinks.

"Yes, that is fine!"
Said Crystal

"Then it shall be three seventy five."
Said General

Crystal Saint Claire holds out four dollars.

"..."
Said Crystal

"I am fairly sure some of these were yours at some point."

"They will be happy to return to you."

General Store Owner gingerly takes the dollars and shuffles through them. He sticks them into the

wooden drawer of the register and pulls out a quarter.

"Does the money have feelings about who has it or how it's used?"
Said General

You back yet?(To Yuppie b.):

"I like to imagine it does. Sometimes I give them little voices."
Said Crystal

"Hmmm..."
Said General

General Store Owner taker another pull of his cigarillo. He pulls it out of his mouth and taps the ash off on

the counter's edge.

"Interestin' proposition."
Said General

"I... have a few odd beliefs I am sure Whitney would love to shake me of."
Said Crystal

"Remnants of a misspent youth."

"Folks don't have to believe just like each other to get along."
Said General

"I know, but I would rather end up wherever Whitney is going after she dies, rather than my

current consignment to oblivion in the hereafter."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"You sure Miss Whitney's going to the place she thinks she is?"
Said General

"I trust Whitney..."
Said Crystal

"And even if she is not... I will follow her regardless."

"Mighty kind of you."
Said General

"Faithful too."

"I'm sure there's some reward for that."

"Even if it ain't divine."

I am back(From Whitney G. Elieen):

General Store Owner slides Crystal's purchases across the countertop to her.

Faith check.(To Whitney G. Elieen):

Crystal Saint Claire stows the purchase in her bag

Whitney G. Elieen:

Roll another d12.General Store Owner:

"Thank you, sir! We will likely be back in the future, to bother you again about supplies!"
Said Crystal

(To GM) rolling 3d10kh1!!

General Store Owner:+0402

Whitney G. Elieen:

I think he meant just another 1d12...Crystal Saint Claire:

I meant roll another single d12 for that twelve you got.General Store Owner:

But that works too.

Whitney G. Elieen:

...General Store Owner:

Whitney G. Elieen:

. . .Crystal Saint Claire:

U cheeky mother.General Store Owner:

Crystal Saint Claire:

My dice exploded ral good

Quit.General Store Owner:

sorry.Crystal Saint Claire:

Whitney's hand reaches out and brushes against Bean's arm as he pushes the

merchandise over. The room seems to slide for a moment, everything becoming more fluid. Then Mister Bean is

not standing in front of you anymore. A skeleton, about his size, dressed in a red coat like the Store Owner's, is

is that for everyone?(From Crystal Saint Claire):

or just... Whitney.(From Crystal Saint Claire):

That would be for everyone.(To Poage):

"...Mr.Bean."
Said Crystal

"You have lost weight."

"This may not be healthy."

"Thank you for your concern dear."??:

"I would like to think the sheer absurdity of this particular situation has simply bypassed any

usual reactions of shock I would go through."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"...I knew I had felt God's hand guiding me to some end..."Whitney G. Elieen:0

"I imagine that's got to feel odd."??:

"And now the truth is revealed."
Said Whitney

"Plain as day."
Said Whitney

"You have nothing to apologize for, sir!"
Said Crystal

"It is likely a defense mechanism."

"...How do you do that?"

"Do what?"??:

"Look either... like a skeleton, or not like a skeleton. I do not wish to assume which is the

Crystal Saint Claire:

"...Are you..."

"I think you know which is which dear."??:

"Are you a Huckster?"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire gasps.

"Oh no."??:

"I've never been that good at cards."

"What are you then?"
Said Whitney

Crystal Saint Claire looks crestfallen.

Crystal Saint Claire realizes something.

"Perhaps you could take a guess?"??:

"What brings you here? In the name of the Lord above I command thee speak."
Said Whitney

"This... this may render finding a Huckster uneccesary!"
Said Crystal

"I'm sure it's not that hard."??:

"Is there a differnet word I should be using? It is the only one I have learned..."
Said Crystal

"My knowledge of the occult is less than stellar..."

"Crystal...behind me. I know not the manner of creature this is but I feel I know whom he

Whitney G. Elieen:

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire slowly shuffles behind Whitney.

"Some might say that you've got a stellar knowledge of the occult. Occult does mean difficult to get knowledge

after all, and you've got quite a lot of that."

"I do not wish to believe this, as he has been nothing but kind to me..."
Said Crystal

"I do like to be kind."??:

"Beware the serpent Crystal...for the lord of darkness can take many forms."
Said Whitney

"Perhaps... simply a ghost? A spirit somehow bound here?"
Said Crystal

"And his words are so often like honey to the ears..."
Said Whitney

"I'm afraid you've got the wrong one Whits."??:

(Dear god this track is jamming)Whitney G. Elieen:

"Whitney... Either way I can learn from this venture."
Said Crystal

"Though if you're looking for him, I could point you the right way."??:

"...Are you a demon?"
Said Crystal

Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit is busy sucking on a peppermint stick.

"I know there are many words and subsections thereof..."
Said Crystal

"Think more in between."

"...Hm..."
Said Crystal

"Like sandwich filling."??:

Crystal Saint Claire:

"But that seems unlikely, as even they require functional muscles."
Said Crystal

"What could I be then?"

"I know...not the manner of creature you are. God has showed me the truth but to what end

has yet to be revealed to me."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Maybe you can see me because I'm something you believe in."??:

"Perhaps an illusion... But the ability to feign tactile sensation would be leaps and bounds

past what I knwo to be possible..."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"And your belief has quite a lot of power in it."??:

"...Guardian Angel?"
Said Crystal

"I have seen angels Crystal...he is not a messanger."
Said Whitney

"And those who would are a bit...off in the head."??:

"...I am trying to offer as many theories as possible..."
Said Crystal

"Not always."??:

"Are you a manifestation of various psychosis?"
Said Crystal

"I am certainly a manifestation."??:

"...This is difficult without knowledge of the parlence."
Said Crystal

"Though I'm associated only with Thanatophobia if I recall."??:

"...You are... death?"
Said Crystal

"No... Death? Capital "D" ?"

"The proverbial Grim Reaper?"

"Then you are false."
Said Whitney

"More a Revelations sort of guy."??:

"This is difficult, with such a broad area of lore to pick from..."
Said Crystal

"For only God holds the power over life and death."
Said Whitney

"...are you claiming to be prophecy made manifest?"

"...Revalations, revelations--"
Said Crystal

"Do you have a horse?"

"You do remember the angel of death that took the lives of the Egyptians don't you?"??:

"Or am I aiming too high with that one?"
Said Crystal

"I do."??:

"Though she isn't here at the moment."

"You are the angel of death?"
Said Whitney

"Which one?"
Said Crystal

"I apologize if you are the fourth..."

"I'm a sort of..."??:

"Anthropomorphic personification."

"Crystal might know the word."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"...you are a sign?"
Said Whitney

"The sign of the end times?"

"More a symbol of belief."??:

"If you are a man-shaped version of a concept, is there a version of that concept in a less

man-shaped form? One we would not be capable of comprehending?"

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Is that why God has shown you to me?"
Said Whitney

Crystal Saint Claire thinks.

"Yes...yes you must be."
Said Whitney

"Yes Whits, you've got he most powerful belief here."??:

"Powerful enough to see what your eyes don't want to look at."

"It would be like..."
Said Crystal

"Like if I tried to explain physics to Nephi."

"He would understand that I was saying something, and some of the math..."

"But the concept behind it, the form of the message, would likely pass unfound."
Said Crystal

"Unless I used an explanation tailored to his level."

"Rather than a college class, explain things on a practical level."

"There's quite a few who would say that true mastery of a concept is the ability to explain it to someone who

knows nothing of it."

"Yes!"
Said Crystal

"So f course, an omnipotent, all-present being could find a way to put an abstract concept in a form

comprehendable by human beings."

"You cannot touch grief, or hunger, or war. But you can see their effects, and feel them."

"They are forces we cannot directly affect, that affect us directly."

"...the great controversy is drawing to a close."
Said Whitney

"Father...forgive me..."

"The great.... controversy?"
Said Crystal

"And humans always like to invent things to help them understand."??:

Crystal Saint Claire tilts her head

"Forgive me that I had doubted you and your message..."
Said Whitney

"Like gremlins that cause mold."??:

"That sounds silly."
Said Crystal

"The great controversy...the battle between good and evil."
Said Whitney

"Oh."
Said Crystal

"That sounds ominous."

"The seemingly endless struggle between the Lord and the deceiver."
Said Whitney

"It does sound silly, but it is an explanation of something."??:

"Yes."
Said Crystal

"It is not provable, but it is an attempt."

"This is a sign. A sign of the end."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen clutches her chest

"Whitney? Are you okay?"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire clings to Whitney

"It might be, but the end is never the end is never the end."??:

"Wait, that is oddly worded..."
Said Crystal

"The end has been supposed to come for a long time, but there's always something that stops it."??:

"Lord...lord above I am sorry to have ever doubted you...the end times are coming."
Said Whitney

"...will it be us?"
Said Crystal

"I hope it is us, if evil is winning right now."

"Your arrival is soon...but what comes before...God protect us."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen takes a deep breath

"It could be you this time."??:

"Whitney, we can help people!"
Said Crystal

"Or it could be a cosmic rule that stops it."??:

"Cosmic... rule?"
Said Crystal

"There's rules that God abides by."??:

"He has his own set of commandments to follow, like the rest of us."

"Who would enforce them?"
Said Crystal

"He does."??:

"God is a God of his word."
Said Whitney

"Against... himself?"
Said Crystal

"Because if he didn't do as the definition of himself does, he would no longer be himself, now would he?"??:

"...that is a good point."
Said Crystal

"He did once before...when he sent his son to die on our behalf."
Said Whitney

"The ultimate enforcement of the rules he set."

"A door that does not open is a wall."
Said Crystal

"Or it could lack a doorknob."??:

"Or be locked."

"For he is a just God but also a god of mercy."
Said Whitney

"Or any number of other things."??:

"It's never just one thing."

"Right. But a door that does not open, functionally speaking, is just a worse version of a

Crystal Saint Claire:

"It all depends on perspective."

"Correct"
Said Crystal

"It is getting a bit late."??:

"Do either of you have any other questions right now?"

"How can I find Manitou?"
Said Crystal

"Ask your friend Alexander."??:

"He knows how to call one up safely."

"Will we still be allowed to buy things from you?"
Said Crystal

"Of course, I'm here to ease pain as best I can."

"And..."
Said Crystal

"To help the weary and the burdened."??:

"This will be my last question, I promise..."
Said Crystal

"Is there any way to communicate with manitou without angering them? Simple conversation, rather than

competition or bargaining?"

"I'm afraid not. You've always got to offer some sort of challenge to them. Though it can be presented in lots

and lots of different ways."

"...I have no questions. For if this is a sign from God than it is already the answer to the

question I never thought to ask till now."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"The work we do here is indeed holy, for it paves the way for his second coming on this earth."

"You did say something...peculiar"

"About where I am going...what do you mean by this?"

"Where you're going?"??:

I don't know yet."

"There's a lot of options."

"There is only one option for me"
Said Whitney

"And that is home. With my family"

"There may be, or there might be extenuating circumstances that develop between there and then."??:

"As someone sometime says."

"The times, they are a changing."

"And changing and changing and they keep on being different from one second to the next."

"God would not show me paradise if he had not prepared my place there...it is not him I

Whitney G. Elieen:

"He will lead me. His hand guides me...what do I have to be afraid of?"

"He hasn't called you home as of yet, so you're still down here, roughing it."

"Making choices."

"Determining destinations."

"He has shown me home...he has shown me where the roads of the faithful lead. My purpose

here is to serve his will...and save as many as I can. So they too can enjoy eternity in paradise"

Whitney G. Elieen:

"I am prepared...and I am done here."

"Alright then, come back and see me sometime."??:

"I love to chat."

"We will, sir!"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire heads home

The shops is quiet and empty of all except the three travelers in the night.

Do you all head back to the hotel?

The saloon.

It's sort of like a hotel.

But with more emphasis on vice.

She would return to her room to pray as hard as she couldWhitney G. Elieen:

(To GM) rolling 1d100

"I am surprised that went as well as it did!"
Said Crystal

It's uncertain at the moment Whitney. Sleep on it.

Both of you can have a red chip.

Crystal Saint Claire snuggles up to Whitney for warmth

Whitney G. Elieen snuggles right back. Holding her just a little bit tighter and a little bit closer.

Her heart beats like a rabbit's.Crystal Saint Claire:

Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit naps at the foot of the bed.

Whitney G. Elieen squeezes...

Crystal Saint Claire has provided LB with the tent to use for wamth, and a pillow.

"JUST BANG ALREADY."
Said Yells

Crystal Saint Claire is actively Not Moaning

Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit snoozes happily in his tent on the pillow that is just about his size.

Whitney G. Elieen runs a hand through her hair...

Crystal Saint Claire is NOT GONNA MAKE A NOISE

Crystal Saint Claire is very warm tonight.

Whitney G. Elieen is just as warm and oddly grabby tonight

Crystal Saint Claire doesn't seem to mind... She remains nestled up against the much larger woman like a

stuffed animal.

Crystal Saint Claire is mumbling in her sleep agian.

Whitney G. Elieen holds you tight with the occasional stroke of the hair...seeming especially restless this

Moon will be back momentarily.

And I have arranged for several surprises.

Kansas city is pretty nice, all things considered. There's good drink, good food, and good company, if you take my

meaning. There is business to attend to though, and after a day to rest from travels, everyone bands together to

head to the main Marshalry Offices.

Alexander Hauswald is waiting, a stoic expression on his face. Sacks is by his side.

Sacks idly scratches his ear.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks terribly excited

"All that travelin' and we're finally here."
Said Nephi

Poage is here too

"Guess we are."
Said Alexander

"How'd that poker game go, by the way?Nephi "
Said Longiron

"I had a call o'the, uh..."

"Brown rain."

"Think it mighta had something to do with some old beans."

"...Went too well."
Said Alexander

"...What's that supposed to mean?"
Said Nephi

Cassie-May O'Brien looked somewhat grouchy. Perhaps the reason was her not drinking coffee at the

"...Very long story."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald looks around, and examines something in his pocket.

"Maybe we can play some time! I learned from Mr. Bean at the general store!"
Said Crystal

"I should play with more people to improve..."

"...Mr. Bean?"
Said Alexander

"He owns the store."
Said Crystal

"...Mr. Bean?"
Said Nephi

"...Think I played with him."
Said Alexander

Big Bawss Bandit has irons on his arms and legs and is walking along with the rest of the party. He

grumbles something on occasion.

"He taught me poker... and I may have accidentally won twenty dollars."
Said Crystal

"Y'all, never play poker wit' Crystal 'ere."
Said Cassie-May

is the kid here?(From Crystal Saint Claire):

"...Reminds me."
Said Alexander

"...Then again, Ah never woulda pay tha' much fer a steak mahself, howerver darn good it

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"And of you know something about coins?"
Said Alexander

Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit walks along behind the larger bandit with his colt's stock at his shoulder.

Crystal Saint Claire moves back to talk with the two of them.

"So."
Said Crystal

"Should I go over the general plan again?"

"...Guess that's nobody."
Said Alexander

Big Bawss Bandit stares at Crystal with his one...sort of good eye. It is hard to tell the quality of it since it

appears to be red and not made entirely out of flesh.

"Nothin bout coins here."
Said Nephi

"Take em to a banker, maybe?"

"They got a bank in town, I bet."

"...Uh..."
Said Cassie-May

"Don't think I can."
Said Alexander

Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit perks up and peers up to Crystal's face from the ground as he walks.

"Huckster stuff."
Said Alexander

"I'll take your word for it."
Said Nephi

"We're takin these fellas in for the bounty, right?"

to-- EXCUSE ME LONGIRON"

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Whut?"
Said Nephi

Crystal Saint Claire sounds pissed.

"...Since when them's two?"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien stared at the bandits

"..."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald looks at the bandits, and then at Sacks.

"We are not 'taking in' a TEN-YEAR-OLD for a BOUNTY."
Said Crystal

"What's the problem?"
Said Nephi

"...Why do we have a ten year old bandit here."
Said Alexander

"He is not..."
Said Crystal

"He is not a bandit."

"Eeeyup, whut in tarnation dun' happen?"
Said Cassie-May

"He is my bodyguard."
Said Crystal

"I'm not?"
Said Lil

"Where'd th' kid come from?"
Said Cassie-May

"Oh, right."
Said Lil

"He is the son of the man in the leg irons"
Said Crystal

"Aw, look. Crystal made a friend."
Said Nephi

"I came from dad's camp when he didn't come home the other night."
Said Lil

"Whom I will be attempting to deputize."
Said Crystal

"..."
Said Alexander

"Awrigh, but where did he dun' come from!?"
Said Cassie-May

Alexander Hauswald looks at Crystal.

"...You got a bandit's kid following you around."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano pokes Alex lightly.

"Ssssh. Just let her have this."
Said Nephi

"The way I see it, he managed to succeed as a bandit for a while."
Said Crystal

"Why do you-"
Said Alexander

"I don't think she's ever had a friend before"
Said He

Alexander Hauswald looks at Nephi.

Alexander Hauswald rolls his eyes

"That means he knows how bandits think, how they work. That makes him an asset, if he is

willing to work with us, and provides him a source of income he can use to provide for his family without resorting

to banditry."

Crystal Saint Claire:

Big Bawss Bandit grumbles something unpleasant sounding.

Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit jabs the bigger bandit in the knee.

remember him bein' there on th' train!?"Cassie-May O'Brien:

"...Don't think about it, Cass."
Said Alexander

"Just don't."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano shrugs

"But Ah-"
Said Cassie-May

"...Am Ah really th' only un' concerned by this?"

"No."
Said Alexander

"No. But I know that Crystal's going to throw a fit if we disagree and ah don't want to

deal with that right now."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"But thinking only makes it worse."
Said Alexander

Sacks sniffs the little boy.

are a set of double doors just waiting to be opened.

Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit smells like peppermint, for some reason.

What's the protocol for entering the office of a bunch of lawmen, and women, again?

Knock on the door?

Alexander Hauswald just knocks on the damn door.

Shoot the lock off and kick the door down to establish dominance?

Sacks wags his tail!

Cassie-May O'Brien stared at the assembled posse with a complicated expression on her face. Mostly

"Bark bark!"
Said Sacks

"...But Ah j- ye know whut, fuck it. Whutever. Ah ain' drunk enough fer this."
Said Cassie-May

Just as Andrew's hand is about to make contact with wood, the door swings open.

"Oh."
Said Nephi

Behind it is a red headed woman in a green dress.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano blinks

"Helloooooo~"
Said Nephi

"Hello, you must be the ones Mister Fossifer sent for."
Said Secretary

Alexander Hauswald nods and pulls out his letter.

"We sure are!"
Said Cassie-May

"That's us."
Said Alexander

"Come in, come in."
Said Secretary

"Yess ma'am."
Said Nephi

"I'm sure you've got lots of questions and we've got lots of answers."
Said Secretary

Nephi "Longiron" Delano tips his hat to the lady and follows in behind the others

"Not all of them, but some."
Said Secretary

Secretary steps aside and waves you into the offices with a flourish.

"Pretty empty for such a big place."
Said Nephi

Can everyone see and move?

YepNephi "Longiron" Delano:

"...Waste of space."
Said Alexander

Alexander starts fucking running around the room to prove his point.

"Figger it's built for more folks than are currently occupying, right?"
Said Nephi

"Correct..."
Said Secretary

"That seems likely."
Said Crystal

"Most likely."
Said Alexander

"We've been having, a little trouble as of late."
Said Secretary

"tha's a huge office..."
Said Cassie-May

Secretary walks forward towards the desk at the back of the room.

"...Tha's a dead man at th' desk."
Said Cassie-May

"We are here to speak with..."
Said Crystal

"What should we do with the ah..."
Said Nephi

Crystal Saint Claire digs through her bag for the letter.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano jerks a thumb back towards the big bandit.

"... Looks like Deadman got here first."
Said Alexander

"Marshall... the rest of it is covered by a stain."
Said Crystal

Wily Galen is scribbling something down onto a piece of paper with the nub of a pencil.

Sacks 's ears droop at the sight of the walking talking corpse.

"...Right. Welp, no time like the present."
Said Nephi

"Good to know you guys are just as polite as the last time."
Said Wily

"Sorry."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald shrugs.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano pointedly ignores the dead man.

"Sacks doesn't like you."
Said Alexander

"Nothing personal."

"Are the rest of you coming?"
Said Secretary

"C'mon folks!"
Said Nephi

Crystal Saint Claire waves to Garen!

"Hello!"
Said Crystal

"Don't be shy."
Said Nephi

"Come along. We will most likely remain in the back, while the others talk..."
Said Crystal

Wily Galen waves back, then resumes scribbling on his pad.

"And then we try to figure out how this will work!"
Said Crystal

"Marshal Fossifer?"
Said Secretary

("Dear diary, my pencil is not working. Love, Galen.")Alexander Hauswald:

Secretary walks forward a few steps and taps her heel against the desk.

"THAT was his name. Fossifer!"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire steps forward.

Crystal Saint Claire scribbles something down in her little lab hournal

Overmarshal Fossifer pops up from where he was bending over in his chair and looks up to see the

visitors in his office. He rubs a hand over his dark skinned face and blinks a few times.

"...Howdy?"
Said Cassie-May

Alexander Hauswald just nods at the man.

"Sorry, late night."
Said Overmarshal

Nephi "Longiron" Delano bows his head and removes his hat.

"Greetins!"
Said Nephi

Overmarshal Fossifer takes a moment to run his eyes over the group. The marshal's eyes get a little bit

wider when he sees the two bandits. His left hand slides open a drawer in his desk and pulls a book out.

Crystal Saint Claire nods.

"Hello."
Said Crystal

"I take it all of you got your letters and made it here with..."
Said Overmarshal

Crystal Saint Claire is shaking a little, but places herself directly between the Marshall and the bandits.

"Not going to say no difficulty."
Said Overmarshal

"Only minor difficulty."
Said Crystal

"Good, good."
Said Overmarshal

"Could've been worse."
Said Alexander

"Coulda been way worse."
Said Nephi

"Lil' problems."
Said Cassie-May

"But hey, no better way to prove we know our stuff, right?"
Said Nephi

Big Bawss Bandit bristles a little, but is otherwise silent.

(("I shot a guy in the dick."))Alexander Hauswald:

"Right you are."
Said Overmarshal

"Well, allow me to welcome all of you to Kansas city."
Said Overmarshal

I'm hereCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers tips her hat

"I am Mister Fossifer, and this..."
Said Overmarshal

"Is what is left of the main Marshalry offices."

"...What's left?"
Said Alexander

"Lookin' minda empteh."
Said Cassie-May

Crystal Saint Claire turns to Bawss.

"You were quite terrifying, honestly."
Said Crystal

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers looks at the Bawss. "This y'all's doin'?"

"It used to be full, before my marshals started dropping faster than flies on poisoned

Overmarshal Fossifer:

Big Bawss Bandit shakes his head after a few moments of contemplation.

"...Not something you tell to new candidates."
Said Alexander

"You want me to lie to you?"
Said Overmarshal

"Keep you in the dark and treat you like mushroom?"

Alexander Hauswald shrugs.

Cassie-May O'Brien snerked at that

"Keepin' in th' dark an' feedin' shit."
Said Cassie-May

"Whut's tj

"So, on a scale of one ta manitous knockin' on the door, how bad is it?"
Said Callie

chujOvermarshal Fossifer:

"Whut's th' reasun fer yer marshalls droppin'?"
Said Cassie-May

"The usual reasons it seems like."
Said Overmarshal

"Getting shot or getting eaten by nasty things most don't want to talk about."

"But that's not it."

"Just what someone wants it to look like."

"...Assassinations?"
Said Alexander

"...Well that ain't good news."
Said Nephi

"Mmmmm..."
Said Overmarshal

"How d'ya figure?"
Said Callie

Overmarshal Fossifer rubs at his chin for a few moments.

Crystal Saint Claire sits back in a chair to listen.

"Some of them, probably, some of them just bandits with better shooting, better guns than

they any right to."

Overmarshal Fossifer:

Cassie-May O'Brien takes example from Crystal - she steps over to the desk, kicks the chair to turn it, and

sits down.

Crystal Saint Claire is writing stuff down in her book, on a fresh page..

Alexander Hauswald just stays standing.

"So, why us?"
Said Cassie-May

Can I get a page for Crystal(From Crystal Saint Claire):

"Y'all dun' ask fer us specifically."
Said Cassie-May

"She has a point."
Said Alexander

Titled "Conspiracies."(From Crystal Saint Claire):

"I am curious how my name even reached your ears. I have tried to be... subtle."
Said Crystal

a second is over.

"I asked for all of..."
Said Overmarshal

Overmarshal Fossifer squints and taps his desk five times.

"Go ahead, you can say it. You didn't ask for those two."
Said Crystal

"No, I sent letters to six."
Said Overmarshal

"Only five of you."

"...Also, Whitney is not here at the moment."
Said Crystal

"She will be here."

"Ah."
Said Overmarshal

"Ah wuz wonderin' where's she."
Said Cassie-May

"She was sick this morning."
Said Crystal

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien wiggled in the chair, confused.

"I hope it is nothing..."
Said Crystal

"Let's hope."
Said Alexander

"She is strong. She will overcome."
Said Crystal

"As for why and how I know about each of you, mostly by reputation."
Said Overmarshal

"Miss Cassie I heard about from Pony Express."

Overmarshal Fossifer turns to regard Cassie for a moment.

Overmarshal Fossifer smiles an odd little smile.

"Yes, Pony Express."
Said Overmarshal

"Very good, retired from job not in a pine box."

(Goddammit. Applejack was heard about from Pony Express. GG.)Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

(HA HA HA)Alexander Hauswald:

"...How'd you hear about me?"

Cassie-May O'Brien put her hooves on the desk

I mean feetCassie-May O'Brien:

"Nice hooves."
Said Crystal

"Whut?"
Said Cassie-May

(Not canon.)Crystal Saint Claire:

"...Anyone else smells apples?"
Said Alexander

(But totally canon.)Crystal Saint Claire:

"Heard about Hauswald from old townsfolk."
Said Overmarshal

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers blinks and then shakes her head. "Ah need ta quit drinkin' rotgut..."

(Okay that's far enough)Crystal Saint Claire:

"Went looking around to see what had happened there."
Said Overmarshal

"Nothing good."

Alexander Hauswald remains stoic, looking at Fossifer.

"...Hurm."
Said Cassie-May

"...Yer name's Hauswald?"
Said Nephi

Secretary clicks forward in her raised heel half boots. She tops in front of Alexander and bends down to

Sacks' level. She holds out a hand.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano says, looking to Alex.

Alexander Hauswald nods.

"Huh."
Said Nephi

Sacks sniffs the girl's hand. Before looking up at her and wagging his tail.

Secretary smiles at the little dog and scratches his floppy ears for him.

Sacks barks happily!

"Bark bark!"
Said Sacks

(I like to imagine that Sacks just says "bark" at some point, like he's given up on trying to

convince anyone.)

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Miss Crystal, I heard about from a few professors, and her uncle."
Said Overmarshal

"...how do you know Uncle Ichabod?"
Said Crystal

((...Okay when is Crystal making him a dog-to-English translator))Sacks:

((When I get a Royal goddamn flush on the draw.))Crystal Saint Claire:

"That one is, partially, my fault."
Said Secretary

"Expound."
Said Crystal

"...Ah'm thinkin' ol' Overmarshall 'ere knows lot more he shows..."
Said Cassie-May

Secretary stands up straight again and walks over to her desk to fiddle with the drawers.

Crystal Saint Claire has not looked up from her writing, and only moves if it is obvious the Secretary

needs her to.

"I keep up with the scientific community as one of my hobbies, and I heard about an exceptional young

graduate from MIT."

"Oh, you have interests in science?"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire perks up a little.

"Any fields in particular?"
Said Crystal

Secretary pulls out a small, round, corn bread looking ball. She takes a sniff of it and looks satisfied.

Crystal Saint Claire looks at the ball.

"What is that?"
Said Crystal

"I have a degree in Civil Engineering, but Physics has always been my favorite subject."
Said Secretary

"It's a hush puppy."

Sacks perks up at the word "puppy".

"...do you have more food in here?"
Said Crystal

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers 's eyes start to glaze over until she hears the words 'hush puppy."

"If so, may I have some? I... slept through breakfast this morning."
Said Crystal

"Of course."
Said Secretary

"...Y'all got hush puppies?"
Said Callie

"On both counts."
Said Secretary

"...on all counts."

Crystal Saint Claire makes a note in her book: "Snack bag"

Nephi "Longiron" Delano rubs his temples.

"I'm not hungry. Sacks is, though."
Said Alexander

Secretary clicks back over to Alex and Sacks. She bends down and offers the hush puppy to the little dog.

"We should get back to doing things."
Said Crystal

"Why specifically us, I believe we were asking?"

"I understand them... But adding in myself, I cannot see us as a "Posse," so to speak."

"Each for different reasons."
Said Overmarshal

Sacks gently grabs it with his teeth, putting it on the ground, and licking the nice lady.

"List 'em?"
Said Cassie-May

Sacks then starts eating.

"But all, because it seemed to me you are all concerned with doing good."
Said Overmarshal

is the Hushpuppy gonna be magic, and make Sacks not able to talk for a bit?(From Crystal Saint Claire):

because that would be pretty good.(From Crystal Saint Claire):

I mean, it's going to take him a while to chew. So yes.(To Poage):

"Strange, though."
Said Alexander

"We're not the best out there."

"I know I'm not."

"Of course not. The best are likely overpriced."
Said Crystal

"Or on the 'other teams' as it were."

"Best?"
Said Overmarshal

"Concern with..."

Overmarshal Fossifer rubs two fingers and a thumb together in the age old gesture of, "Munnay."

"Fair enough."
Said Alexander

"Don't need folk too concerned wit greenbacks."
Said Overmarshal

"Need folk concerned wit helping."

"That don't mean I ain't gonna pay you."

"Just gotta have..."

Overmarshal Fossifer runs his fingers over the oiled cylinder of the gun on his desk as he searches for a

"Right pri-or-ee-tee."
Said Overmarshal

"Huh."
Said Cassie-May

"Ah mean, ah'd rather help people than jus' be greedy."
Said Callie

"My meaning exact."
Said Overmarshal

"Money comes second. First comes helpin the good people and makin a name for

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"I can get behind this."
Said Alexander

"Good, good."
Said Overmarshal

"Good recommendation."

"Only shoot bastards need shot."

"Take alive bastards needs take alive."

"Sit in that desk where Miss Cassie sits."
Said Overmarshal

"...Whut?"
Said Cassie-May

"Been out on call for month."

"No contact."

"...Think they got him?"
Said Alexander

"That is worrisome."
Said Crystal

"Probably got him, don't think he's dead."
Said Overmarshal

"One of the first things I was gonna ask all you to do."

"Track through Billy's caselog."

"See if trail can be picked up."

"...Billy?"
Said Nephi

"Should... Have we?"

"That sounds like a good idea."
Said Crystal

"Ask question that make sense, Delano."
Said Overmarshal

"Guess that's our first case?"
Said Alexander

"...Right."
Said Nephi

"Have to tell me if you accept first."
Said Overmarshal

"All of you."

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers nods. "Ah accept."

"Same here."
Said Alexander

Sacks barks. Somehow you interpret that as "positive"

I fall asleep on my latptop every 5 minutes

T-TCrystal Saint Claire:

(Is alright Varmoose.)Overmarshal Fossifer:

im on up for lke 21 hours now with on;y 2 of sleepCassie-May O'Brien:

sorry buy I gtg

I just can't

I think I'll sleep too if y'all don't mind

(Be ok pls)Crystal Saint Claire:

We did the major important stuff, right?Sacks:

Then I'll head to bed. Just assume Alexander stood there stoically like he always does.

Roger.Overmarshal Fossifer:

CONTINUING ON.

"Tell her come over when she gets chance."

"I will."
Said Crystal

Overmarshal Fossifer scoots his chair back from his desk and walks over to the desk Cassie is sitting at.

His coat has a lot of tassels with bright orange and yellow beads. The tassels click together as he walks

with a pleasant sussuration.

"Also, I have questions regarding... these two."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire points to Bawws and Junior.

Overmarshal Fossifer jimmies one of the larger drawers open and pulls out a small leather bound book.

Some of the pages are a little yellow.

"Mmmm..."
Said Overmarshal

"The main question being, may I deputize the larger one?"
Said Crystal

"No."
Said Overmarshal

"Taking him in."

Crystal Saint Claire sighs.

"What are your plans for him?"
Said Crystal

"Stand trial."
Said Overmarshal

Overmarshal Fossifer tucks the books under his arm and walks forward to look at Big.

"Is there anything I could do to convince whomever will be handing out the verdict that he is

potentially a valuable asset to the law, and a victim of circumstance?"

Crystal Saint Claire:

Overmarshal Fossifer doesn't say anything, he puts a hand on Big's neck and feels around for something.

His hand pauses over a certain spot his neck. Fossifer's index finger taps something, then traces around

Big's neck to his eye.

"Hmmm..."
Said Overmarshal

I'm back. Has the mission begun yet?Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

(Not yet)Crystal Saint Claire:

"I was wondering... about that."

"Seen some of it recent."
Said Overmarshal

"Not right."

"Been meaning to investigate."

"He can help."

"No trial, for now."

"Help how?"
Said Crystal

"Tell where he got eye, maybe something else."
Said Overmarshal

"Be safe with me."

Big Bawss Bandit reaches up and moves the Marshall's hand away from his face.

Crystal Saint Claire walks up to BB.

"Do these terms sound agreeable?"
Said Crystal

Big Bawss Bandit turns and looks to Junior for a moment. The smaller bandage covered individual nods

and pats Big on the leg with affectionate reassurance. Big turns back around and nods.

"I'll help."
Said Big

"Good."
Said Overmarshal

Overmarshal Fossifer walks back over to his desk and pulls out a small box. The box jingles as he places

it on the level wood plain of the desk.

"Then I will agree to the terms of employment as well."
Said Crystal

Overmarshal Fossifer sets the journal down on the desk with one hand while he opens the box. He takes

out a small stack of money, thinks for a moment, then puts another stack on top of it.

Overmarshal Fossifer closes up the box and chucks it back under his desk.

"Hundred dollars for supplies and horses, fifty for the notorious Big Bawws, and record of

cases Billy was working on."

Overmarshal Fossifer:

Crystal Saint Claire takes the record.

"Thank you."
Said Crystal

"Thank you."
Said Overmarshal

The record has a few places marked in it.

Turn to the earliest one, or turn to another?

Earliest onward.Crystal Saint Claire:

I gotta go in a half hour before the liquor store closes. Moon needs her beerCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

(Ok)Crystal Saint Claire:

"Reports of something odd happening in a town in Colorado called Sawtooth, close to

Sunbeam. Something about talking animals, animals walking on two legs, shooting each other. Need to check it

out. "

can you give me an handout I can use to write this stuff down in?(From Crystal Saint Claire):

(We're about done for the night.)

NExt entry!Crystal Saint Claire:

"This is interesting."

Crystal flips over to the next entry.

"Mad scientist in Calpert went a little too far off his rocker. Started messing with the town clock. String of missing

persons. Related? Head over and check, soon.

Make a smarts roll.

Crystal Saint Claire:+07+0902

That place is totally in the United States, might need to to a bit more research on it to

discern more than that.

"Where is Calpert? This place in the log, about the mad scientist."
Said Crystal

"Calpert?"
Said Secretary

"I think..."

"It might be near Colorado."
Said Crystal

"I've never been to school, Eliza."
Said Wily

"That said, Calpert's in Wyoming."

"Wyoming."
Said Crystal

"Thank you!"

Next piece.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has been getting bored of all the listening, and decides to spend his time

looking out of the window.

That's about all you can discern from the journal so far. It's going to take some time to

discern the code the rest of it is written in...or is that just atrocious handwriting?

(To GM) rolling 1d20

Can I check the last one, to make sure it's not just bad handwriting?Crystal Saint Claire:00

Nephi, there's a big ass tumbleweed out there. It looks a little red.

are there dates?Crystal Saint Claire:

No dates, just notes.

Aw.Crystal Saint Claire:

Nephi can roll 2d8 to use his MORMON'S SIGHT to see if there's something fishy

about the tumbleweed.

bruhCrystal Saint Claire:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Why not

Why the hell is that tumbleweed leaving a red streak on the ground?

Most tumbleweeds don't do that.

Do you go after it Nephi?

Of course!Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"...I'll be right back."

"Don' do anything I wouldn't do."
Said Callie

Nephi "Longiron" Delano whistles as he heads out, gatlin' rifle in hand.

That's slightly too badass for tumbleweed chasing.

Yep.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Crystal Saint Claire is absorbed in the journal!

The tumbleweed keeps rolling down the street and heads around a corner. Follow it,

or take a closer look at the trail?

Trail first.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

'Nother 2d8 pardner.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Nephi dips down to his knees and sticks his finger into the red streak. The dirt is wet

with something. Nephi scratches a little bit of the mud underneath his fingernail, then brings it to his nose. He

sniffs. He smells iron.

Wonderful Cowboy Land:0000

(There's not a severed head)

(It's a weiner)Crystal Saint Claire:

(I have a feeling I know)Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

(Two weiners.)Crystal Saint Claire:

(Had to go for a bit)Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"...Oh heck no."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano spins his rifle and walks with it at the ready...

The trail is easy enough to follow, until the damn thing goes up a fence and over the

other side.

...Crystal Saint Claire:

Roll Nimbleness.

Climbing at a bonus.

Headed out to the liquor store now. I need my German beersCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

OkiCrystal Saint Claire:

Lemme check.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

I have way more dice in Nimbleness, let's do this.

you know you can preset exploding dice, right?Crystal Saint Claire:

I know, shushNephi "Longiron" Delano:

I just forgot

Also Gunpowder is different from RangingCrystal Saint Claire:

I'll show YOU gunpowder in just a minuteNephi "Longiron" Delano:

First of all, you gay f'dat.Crystal Saint Claire:00000

Nephi makes it over the fence with style. The rickety construction wobbles under his

(Nephi just does the fuckin' Dukes of Hazzard thing over the fence)Crystal Saint Claire:

The tumbleweed is rolling down another bit of dusty road.

Seems to be heading for an alley.

Still leaving a trail?Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

(FREEZE FRAME, MUSIC STOPS)Crystal Saint Claire:

What do you do Nephi?

Nephi "Longiron" Delano slowly follows, wary and ready to shoot anything that might jump at him with a

trio of bullets.

(It was about that time the cowpoke realized he might be in over his head.)Crystal Saint Claire:

Oh shit we didn't draw fate chips for this seshNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Shhhhhhh

I forgot.

(But then again, a lot of things went over his head. Birds, jokes, particularly deep

Crystal Saint Claire:

We'll do it when everyone is actually here.

I only have one chip leftNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Good thing I am hereCrystal Saint Claire:

Fffffffine.

I have Many ChipsCrystal Saint Claire:

Nev.

There U go.

There's ya Fate Chips.

I'm cool with this.

Oh rightCrystal Saint Claire:

Get those noted on your sheets and tell me when you do.

Hold on I messed up my screen one secNephi "Longiron" Delano:

I need to spend some chipsCrystal Saint Claire:

I have 6/5 red chipsCrystal Saint Claire:

You gotta cash some in.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Heard.Crystal Saint Claire:

I got em noted.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Mine noted as wellCrystal Saint Claire:

The tumbleweed keeps moving, there's something...odd about it.

Something that does not belong.

Maybe it's the bear trap.Crystal Saint Claire:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano gets ready to shoot the darn thing. There any breeze going right now?

There's a little bit of one TN 6.

Hit the thing.

Dumbass.

I've got the gatling rifle so here goes.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:+02+09+0206

That's a single bullet hit of the trio.

It's a tumbleweed so... I'm gonna assume no hit location.

Nah manCrystal Saint Claire:

Hit that tumbleweed in the goddamn legCrystal Saint Claire:

Three bullets from clip-Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Oh right reliability

( )/16

Wait oops

And now it works, so one can check for reliability.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Even better!

Enough of that though, Imma put all that in a macro so we don't have to go through this again.

Two of the bullets kick up clods of dirt around the tumbleweed. The third hits it. The

bullet slices through the weed and sends red splashing onto the ground. The weed jerks, rolls five, twenty feet,

and stops.

"...Good shootin, Nephi."
Said Nephi

"...But tumbleweeds ain't supposed to bleed."

Ever seen Fivel Goes WestCrystal Saint Claire:

"...?"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano turns to look towards the speaker.

Little Girl stands behind Nephi. The right leg of her dress is torn. Her legs is bleeding. So is her arm. She

is cradling a small furry creature in her arms that makes a mewling noise every few seconds.

"...Heeeeeeeeey there."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano keeps his gun in his hands, but lowers it.

"...Weird tumbleweed's dealt with, you ain't got nothin to worry about."
Said Nephi

"...An' you should probably see a sawbones bout all that bleeding."

(To GM) rolling 1d5

Little Girl:

Little Girl looks down at her leg. Then, she looks at the ball of fur in her arms.

"I'll be fine."
Said Little

"Do you know someone who can take care of my cat?"

"...Uhhuh. Little girl, your momma or poppop around?"
Said Nephi

("I'm a pilot")Crystal Saint Claire:

"Uh, I think I can find someone."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks at the furry thing.

"...That's a cat, huh?"
Said Nephi

"Yes, he is."
Said Little

Nephi "Longiron" Delano takes a look

Little Girl continues to hold the mass of fur to her chest. Nephi can see as he gets closer, the girl's arm is

not bleeding. The cat is. There are dozens of puncture wounds across the feline's body and no small

amount of blood on the girl's dress. He needs a veterinarian quick, or he will die.

"...!"
Said Nephi

"...Oh darn!"

Who thoCrystal Saint Claire:

"Figure he might be able to do something..."

I am... 60 percent sure he does not possess Veterinary abilitiesCrystal Saint Claire:

Thought Cassie was our only medic

Little Girl looks at Nephi for a while before nodding.

"Okay."
Said Little

I'm pretty confident Alex has abilities that can do that.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

He does.Little Girl:

"Marshall's building. Alex should know what to do..."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano helps the girl over in that direction.

But Alex's player is PTFO, no?

Little Girl follows along behind Nephi. She is a little slower than him, but speedy enough to keep within

Which is why we're going to end on a cliffhanger for now.Little Girl:

"This way..."
Said Nephi

Heh.Crystal Saint Claire:

That's about all I've got for the moment.Little Girl:

okie dokie!Crystal Saint Claire:

More will come later.Little Girl:

Sevchenko requires our aid!Crystal Saint Claire:

AT THE GUNDAM THINGY

aigbhtNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Behold your new title screen.

Could I please get a quick tl;dr of what I misseD?

Talked with the marshal a bit more, I believe everyone agreed to get hired on.

Gave you some pay and the caselog of one of the missing marshals that he suspects is still alive.

Got a lot of headings, what you need to do now is decide where to go so I can get stuff rolling.

Then Nephi chased a tumbleweed that wasn't a tumbleweed.

Found out it hurt a little girl and her cat.

He's taking the cat to Alexander to get it patched up.

Alex is closer though.

That should be about it.

Crystal has the caselog of the missing marshal.

Notes about current, past, and future cases.

Colorado- Sawtooth (Near Sunbeam) , Wyoming- Calpert,

That's because that's THE PLAYER caselog.

For player notes.

I see!

Cassie-May's scene.

Also, something that will likely be relevant.

The missing marshal's name is Billy.

It has been a long day Cassie. You've been trying to watch our for everyone and make sure the small bandit still

with you doesn't get up to any funny business. The only thing that seems to hold his interest for longer than two

seconds is peppermint sticks, shooting, and Whitney. Not sure if the little fella is actually interested in her sermons

or the...holy sacraments inside her dress. Not too bad really, or at least no worse than Nephi. The big fella got

dropped off at the marshal's office, so he's out of your hair now. Time to lay down and, sleep.

Cassie-May O'Brien was NOT happy about the sleeping part. She avoided sleep as long as she could, but

she realized her body needed the rest. It's a shame it was no rest for her mind and poor soul.

Cassie-May O'Brien made the sign of the cross and, taking a sigh like a trooper about to go over the

(Forgot to hand those out last session, and you might need them for this.)

Aye aye, added to sheet.Cassie-May O'Brien:

This should be simple. Close your eyes. Don't think of anything. Sleep should come

soon. All it takes is waiting and not thinking of what might be lurking in the blackness.

Son of a bitch.

It's itching again.

The spot on your hand.

Cassie-May O'Brien rubbed her palm with a groan, clenching her jaw.

You can hear the whispers.

Like always.

"N-nnnrrrrgh..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien trashed in the bed. What was that... What was that voice saying...?

The harder you listen the more you feel like something is tugging at your chest.

Cassie-May O'Brien weakly pawed at her chest in her sleep.

There's something there.

An old hand, weathered by work, time, and sun.

A familiar hand.

"N-no..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien turned her head, as if trying to see it in her sleep.

There's something else in the bed with you. Little round things that clack together as

you roll.

They are warm.

Some warmer than others.

"Whuu..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien turned her head in her sleep, trying to see with closed eyes.

The hand is there. You can see a brown palm. The palm shares your mark. It brushes

against the discs. They shine with a wan luminescence. There are five ones that shine white. Five that shine red.

One that shines blue.

Cassie-May O'Brien tries to grab the palm!

Cassie's hand wraps around the palm.

You can feel the tugging get stronger, pulling at your chest even harder than before, but there is no resolution, not

yet. The palm is cold. Perhaps it could use, a little warming up?

Cassie-May O'Brien put her other hand on the unfamiliar-yet-famliar palm and ran her fingers over it in

confusion. She has always had warm hands.

Her other hand makes the palm no warmer. It bend down and brushes against the

gently glowing discs.

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien let go with one hand, and extended it to the discs. What were those...? That hand

seemed to... want them? Should she give one up...?

The fingers of the palm point to two of the white discs. It gets close, but does not

touch them. Then it returns to the position it held before.

Cassie-May O'Brien was confused... this was nothing like her usual nightmares. It was so...

Cassie-May O'Brien grabbed one of the white discs in her hand.

The palm curls its fingers inward in a gesture of beckoning.

Cassie-May O'Brien moved her lips silently. There was something...

"..."
Said Cassie-May

The palm makes no reply.

It waits.

Cassie-May O'Brien was torn. Ain't nothing in life for free, Dad said. But...

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien put the one white disc in the cold palm.

The palm accepts the disc. It holds it for a moment, testing it maybe. It bounces the

disc in its palm twice. It did touch two of them.

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien grabbed the other white disc. Ah, what the hell. If this was all it took... this was so

much better than her normal nightmares. Another white disc was sacrificed to the palm.

The palm accepts the second disc.The fingers curl closed and the palm becomes a

fist for a moment. It squeezes. When it opens again, the discs are gone. It reaches forward and gently takes

Cassie's arm.

Then it yanks her with the force of a cannon blast into blackness so dark that her eyes might as well be gone.

"!!!"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie travels through the darkness for some time. She can't tell if the palm is there

any longer, only tenebrous black remains.

Cassie realizes that the black is no longer the same.

It feels like the black of being in a room with no light, instead of being in...whatever she was before.

Cassie-May O'Brien reached out, feeling for... anything, really.

Aches and pains emerge. Strange ones that correspond to nothing that Cassie has

felt before. Alien sensations probing into her consciousness from some peculiar body.

The ground shifts.

Cloth moves.

Rustling of papers.

The rasp of a match, and finally some goddamn light.

(I can now)Cassie-May O'Brien:

Cassie-May O'Brien took a shaky step forward.

Cassie-May O'Brien then another. And another.

A wall.

Cassie-May O'Brien moved along it, hand on the wall.

The wall seems to stop and give way to...the blackness of dreams.

It would not be a good idea to go beyond it, yet.

"..."
Said Cassie-May

The ragged shoes on Cassie's alien body slosh through blood.

Cassie-May O'Brien knelt down. A body...?

It is sticky, and coagulated, but not yet totally dry.

A man.

Well dressed, but very much dead.

There is a shining pistol in his hand, and something strange over his left eye.

It almost looks like a stove element.

Cassie-May O'Brien examines that weird something.

On closer inspection, it seems to be a red light with a protective metal casing. It

extends out of the man's socket an inch.

There does not seem to be an eye underneath it.

Cassie-May O'Brien pulls it out

It resists at first, but the hands of this odd body are strong, despite their decrepit look.

The contraption slides out of the man's socket with five good tugs.

There are several...wires hanging off it.

Cassie-May O'Brien stares at the contraption, dumbfounded.

Some are obviously copper, some look like viscera, and some shine oddly in the light

of the cigarette between the Smoker's teeth.

This is not something that should have been built.

Not something that any god fearing man would create.

It screams Mad Scientist.

Cassie-May O'Brien inspects the eye hole with the decrepit fingers of the other hand of this weird body.

Joints creak as Cassie makes the Smoker's body bend down and investigate the dead

man's eye socket.

The device seems to have taken up the space of...about three fourths of an index finger.

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Then there's some mangled bits of squishy meat that Cassie takes to be brain.

Cassie-May O'Brien pats the corpse down, curious for other weird contraptions.

There are bullets in one of the suit pockets. They are slick with partially dried blood.

Cassie-May O'Brien takes those. What caliber?

The Smoker's hand transfers the bullets to his coat pocket. It holds up one for closer

inspection. Looks to be a forty-four. It has an odd engraving of a...bird on the side.

Cassie-May O'Brien looks for the reason for the corpse's demise.

There's two holes in the pants leg of the corpse, and one in the upper chest.

Judging by the blood trail, the poor bastard might have been alive enough to crawl over here before bleeding out.

Cassie-May O'Brien pocketed the weird device and patted the corpse's pockets again to make sure, then

stood up.

The Smoker's body moves at Cassie's command. There's the tap of something

against the chest of the Smoker as he stands. Cassie can barely feel it amidst the aches, pains, and popping

Cassie-May O'Brien glanced down and put her - his? - hand there, curious and confused.

Ah, a shoulder rig. Leather one.

There's a pistol in the holster.

Cassie-May O'Brien pulls out the gun.

It is a heavy piece. Revolving cylinder, feels like a double action. Got an octagonal

barrel and a good grip. It feels right in the Smoker's hand, like a handshake from an old friend.

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien checks the chamber.

The chamber is full. It takes six bullets. Four of them look to be spent.

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien checks the corpse for holes again. Three wounds, yes?

Three, two in the leg, one in the upper chest.

Cassie-May O'Brien assumed she was the shooter.

Cassie-May O'Brien came to where the blood trail started and knelt down again, feeling the ground for a...

There's nothing to find, save for the blood and a depression in the ground where the

Smoker laid.

"..."
Said Cassie-May

". . ."

Cassie-May O'Brien checks for wounds on own body.

Cassie-May O'Brien in places the corpse was wounded.

There's nothing on the Smoker's legs, but there is a hole in his gut. His left cheek has

a furrow carved into it.

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien pulled the contraption from the corpse's eye out again with his/her left hand, and the

gun with the right.

The Smoker's hands do so.

Cassie-May O'Brien shoots the contraption.

(Give me a tick)

oki okiCassie-May O'Brien:

Back

Smoker starts easing the trigger back. It gets fully cocked and the hammer snaps forward, but there is no

Smoker thumbs stopped the hammer before it could hit.

Smoker frowns.

"I don't remember doing that."
Said Smoker

Something else is waking up Cassie, and it's pushing you.

"Mmmnnnngh...?"
Said Cassie-May

Smoker reaches up to the cigarette between his teeth, and snuffs it.

Back to black.

There's bedsheets around you, covered in cold sweat.

Cassie-May O'Brien groaned. Is it morning again...? Was that enough sleep for her body..?"

There is a light, but it doesn't feel bright enough to be the sun coming through the

Cassie-May O'Brien felt around. This... was better than her usual nightmares.

There's a lantern burning on the nightstand. A bottle of whiskey sits next to it. The

bottle still has frost clinging to the outside.

Cassie-May O'Brien grabbed the bottle.

Cool to the touch.

Cassie-May O'Brien pulled it over amd took a gulp.

The whiskey rolls down Cassie's throat with a smooth, icy burn. It feels good. Takes a

little bit of the edge off.

"...Ffffuck."
Said Cassie-May

The night goes on.

Yes.

I did include that on the sheet :PCassie-May O'Brien:

It was certainly very very interesting.

I liked it.

Raises... a lot of questions.

Questions that might be answered by a clever mind.

But of course.Cassie-May O'Brien:

Unfortunately all we got is me.

Well, better get to work.

Perhaps it might help to talk about it with someone.

Cassie-May O'Brien nodnods

For now, Cassie should get some rest.

Not every night she can manage that.

Indeed.Cassie-May O'Brien:

That's all for now.

There may be further developments, especially if you seem to piece together something interesting.

Where is Neblles

shrhgAlexander Hauswald:

BILLABOLLOCKBONGLittle Girl:

Love the new splash.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

But yeah, let's be heroes and save a little girl's kitty catAlexander Hauswald:

Nephi and the injured girl carrying her far more injured cat catch Alexander as he's

coming out of the marshalry. Sacks is following along behind him. Sacks is always following along behind Alex.

The little girl has been possessed with a peculiar calm the entire time. Having a beloved pet on the brink of death

normally provokes more tears and less stoic determination.

"..."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald pauses in his tracks, examining the girl and Nephi, and noticing the cat.

""... What'd you do?"
Said Alexander

"Nothin!"
Said Nephi

"But not this thing!"

"He told me that we were going to someone who could help Grimmie."
Said Little

"... Suppose that's me. Let me have a look at him."
Said Alexander

"...Not here, though. Hang on. I got a room by the salloon whete it's cleaner."

"If you think Grimmie will last that long."
Said Little

Little Girl hugs the matted ball of fur close to her bloodied chest.

"I can't fix him with my bare hands. Come on. Let's hurry."
Said Alexander

Little Girl follows Alexander. She glances at Sacks a few times on the way, but the glances grow less

frequent after she is sure he is not going to do anything to her cat.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano follows

Sacks just stares at her, before following his master.

((skip to like, two minutes later when they reach his room?Alexander Hauswald:

The party reaches the saloon. No one blinks as they bring a girl with blood dripping

down her dress with them. The bartender does indicate that they should stay away from the rugs though.

Alexander Hauswald kicks the door to his room open and moves everything from a nearby table.

"Put him on the table. Nephi, go down and get a bottle of something strong."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano does exactly that and...

"Uh."
Said Nephi

"How will I know which one's strong?"

"You ask the bartender. Tell him I need it as disinfectant.Alexander Hauswald:

"...I don't- Got it."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads down and rushes in the general direction of the bartender.

Alexander Hauswald reaches for his suitcase, pulling out a set of tools and setting them carefully.

"when's thr last time Grimmie ate?"
Said Alexander

Little Girl sets her cat on the table. She keeps pressure on the area that has the most puncture wounds,

but the cat still oozes blood onto the tabletop.

"This morning."
Said Little

"About five hours ago."

Alexander Hauswald takes a rag and a bottle of chloroform.

"Good. Means we can sedate him."
Said Alexander

Bartender is waxing his mustache when Nephi comes back down the stairs.

"Hmm?"
Said Bartender

Alexander Hauswald gently presses the now-wet rag against the cat's face, gently making sure he's not

causing any more damage.

"Alex needs some disinfectant!"
Said Nephi

"...Gimme the most alchol-y alcohol you got that alcohols."

The cat breathes in the chloroform for a few minutes. Then his breathing get a little

more shallow.

"Alright. We can operate."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald tries to check the damage, looking at the door.

Bartender stares at Nephi for about five seconds before putting away his mustache wax tin. He bends

down and rummages underneath the bar, then slams a jar of clear liquid onto the countertop.

"Dollar."
Said Bartender

"Nephi, hurry up!"
Said Alexander

There is no wound that is overly terrifying. Each one is about as bad as getting a

fishook ripped out, but there are a lot of them, centered around the cat's belly.

"...These aren't as bad as I thought. There's just a lot of them."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald turns to the girl.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano slams down a dollar from his pocket

"I thought Nephi shot him."
Said Alexander

Bartender takes the dollar.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano grabs the jar as soon as it's offered then runs his ass upstaris

"It was a not tumbleweed."
Said Little

Nephi "Longiron" Delano bursts through the door like a man possessed.

"ALEX! Hah-hur-hurf, just... One sec-"
Said Nephi

"...I know the kind-"
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano holds out the jar

Alexander Hauswald grabs the jar, opens it, and takes a tentative sniff.

"I gotta-hurfotta... Oof."
Said Nephi

Alexander, you're pretty sure you no longer have some of your nose hairs.

"... This'll do. This'll do fine."
Said Alexander

"Cost me a dollar so it darn well better... HURF."
Said Nephi

"You must not run a lot."
Said Little

"Not like that, no!"
Said Nephi

"Alright. Most of these aren't bad. We could get away with cleaning and bandaging them. A

few are gonna need a stitch."

Alexander Hauswald:

It's time to roll.

Alexander Hauswald sets the jar of livercide on the table, gently using it to wet another rag and clean a

needle from his toolset, before gently dabbing at the wounds. With the alcohol rag. He doesn't expect to

cringe the germs away.

What do I roll, again? 5d12?Alexander Hauswald:

Lookat Medicine Veterinary Skills.

Phone warped my character page out of shape.Alexander Hauswald:

You got a five in there.

So yeah, I need to know the actual dice type.Alexander Hauswald:

Neb.

What thing is medicine linked to?

Roll 5d10.

You missed a one.

There ya go brub.

OhNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Uh sorry0

Alexander manages to get the cat's wounds under control with a liberal use of plasters

and stitches on the wider holes. The bleeding is slowed significantly after he finishes. Within five minutes there is

only an occasional drop of blood that seeps out. The cat's breath is still shallow, but it is stable.

UrbanCritter wipes his brow, sighing.

Little Girl looks down at the patchwork kitty. She sighs and the tension in her body eases.

"Thank you."
Said Little

"...Good work, Alex."
Said Nephi

Your name's wrongNephi "Longiron" Delano:

"And try to keep his diet light. As liquid as possible for the next few days."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has found a nearby chair and sat himself down in it.

Little Girl nods as Alex dispenses medicinal wisdom. She reaches out a hand and rests it against the cat's

"...Y'know you never introduced yourself, little missy."
Said Nephi

"You never asked for my name, and a gentleman is supposed to make the first move."
Said Little

"A-"
Said Nephi

"...Well alright ya got me there."

"If everything's alright, come in about two weeks so we could get the stitches out."
Said Alexander

"You don't seem like much of a gentleman though."
Said Little

Alexander Hauswald looks at the little scene, the barest hint of a smile on his face.

"A-hey! Ah'll have you know I'm a spittin'image of a right gentleman."
Said Nephi

"Is that why you have all those guns?"
Said Little

"...M'workin through some things."
Said Nephi

"Gentlemen carry guns."

"They carry guns on their hip, sometimes."
Said Little

"Not rifles."

"...I got bigger things to shoot."
Said Nephi

"Real nasty things. Things little ladies shouldn't hafta worry about."

"Things so scary you'd go runnin home to momma."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano stands up and heads for the room's little window, looking out of it towards the

Alexander Hauswald just cleans his hands and starts packing, his back turned to them as he fights the

urge to laugh.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano doesn't seem well at ease until he's done this.

Little Girl stands there with blood down the front of her dress and a slight frown on her face.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano eventually seems satisfied with what he sees out there.

"Now, c'mon. Let's get you cleaned up."
Said Nephi

"M'sure we can find a bucket somewhere round here."

"I'm sure that I can clean myself just fine when I want to."
Said Little

BRB phone callNephi "Longiron" Delano:

UrbanCritter carefully scoops the cat up, handing him over to the girl.

backNephi "Longiron" Delano:

My poor mother.

Little Girl takes the cat with gentle hands and cradles him against her chest.

"I will."
Said Little

"...You got a home to go back to, lil'missy?"
Said Nephi

"Yes."
Said Little

Little Girl scuffs her feet on the wood floor for a moment.

"I do."
Said Little

"Well you be good for yer momma and poppa, y'hear?"
Said Nephi

(ech)Alexander Hauswald:

"N'yeah, what Alex said."
Said Nephi

"If you want to."
Said Little

"Pack it up, Alex, I'll grab what's left o'my stuff."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano stretches and heads out of the room.

Alexander Hauswald nods.

"It's past the tracks. On the other side of the foundry."
Said Little

Nephi "Longiron" Delano returns with his duster coat slung over one shoulder.

"Le me pack up and we'll be on our way."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald starts packing up, putting the jar of theoretically-alcohol on the shelf.

Sacks was remarkably silent all this time.

"Ready to mosey on outta here, Alex?"
Said Nephi

"Let's go."
Said Alexander

Little Girl walks forward with the cat, careful to maintain a good grip on him.

Bartender watches as the party leaves the saloon. His mustache is now waxed. It looks luxuriant.

Alexander Hauswald nods at the bartender knowingly.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano just carries on.

Bartender does not change his expression in the slightest. He does pick up a glass and begin to polish it

with a stained white cloth.

I gotta goNephi "Longiron" Delano:

I'll be back.

"... Haven't asked. What's your name, kid?"
Said Alexander

"Tessa."
Said Little

The little girl leads Nephi and Alexander through a twisting complex of alleyways and fences. It is difficult to know

exactly where they are. The three of them come to a door.

Little Girl pulls a key out of the pockets of her dress. It shines in the dusk light.

"Alexander."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald just patiently waits.

Little Girl walks up the little set of steps to the door and inserts the key into the lock below the handle.

She twists. Something inside the lock clicks. Tessa pushes the door open.

Alexander Hauswald remains stationary- he wasn't invited in. It's basic manners, really.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano does the same.

"You can come in if you want."
Said Tessa

Tessa takes the key out of the lock with one hand and tucks it back into a pocket of her dress. It

squelches a little. Probably all the blood.

Alexander Hauswald takes a look around before following the girl, wiping his boots before he enters and

closing the door after him.

I'm going to assume he lets Nephi get in as well.

Cause it would be a dick move to just shut the door in his face.

Let's assume.Alexander Hauswald:

The interior of the place is nice. Wood floor with a long rug on it. There are rooms with

brass numbers on the door fronts. lining the hall. There is a simple spiral stairway at the end of the passage.

Tessa starts forward, cat held tight against her.

Alexander Hauswald just follows Tessa silently.

Sacks sniffs around, curious for anything suspicious.

yeah sorry stuff going onNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Alexander's footsteps creak on the floor and his boots leave small prints of dust in the

rug for the first few steps. Sacks smells mostly old people, and something very sweet.

Sacks tries to pin the sweetness down as Alex follows, the dog now curious.

It smells like, fruit?

Roll Snifflin.

It smells apple shaped, but not like an apple.

"..."
Said Sacks

Sacks tries to follow it!

There's a door close to the end of the hall Sacks. Tessa just walked past it. That is

where the smell is strongest.

"Bark bark!"
Said Sacks

"I know, Sacks. Let's do this."
Said Alexander

Where's Cassie

Alexander Hauswald opens the door.

"...What's goin on?"
Said Nephi

Sacks gets on the floor.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano does the dinosaur0

"Sacks smelled something he doesn't understand."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano doesn't actually do that

The door does not open, because it is not unlocked. Alex does manage to jiggle the

handle though. Tessa turns and gives him a look. It seems to insinuate the Alex is doing something

"It's probably just some kinda weird spice."
Said Nephi

"...Mind if I ask what's in there?"
Said Alexander

"Something from... Whatsit, India?"
Said Nephi

"That's Miss Vard's room "
Said Tessa

"She's the one who takes care of the garden in the back."

"Ah, see? Probably peaches or summat."
Said Nephi

"I think it might be persimmons at this time of the year."
Said Tessa

Alexander Hauswald nods and shrugs.

I'm sorry for trying to pull you into 6AF I did not know you guys were doing a thing(From Poage):

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Fine by me. It just confused Sacks over here.*Alexander Hauswald:

"Tasted like heaven in a bottle."
Said Nephi

"Don't like peaches."
Said Alexander

"Whaaaaaaaaaaaat"
Said Nephi

"I knew you seemed odd."
Said Tessa

Alexander Hauswald shrugs.

"Too sweet.Alexander Hauswald:

Tessa continues up the stairs after a moment.

Alexander Hauswald keeps following, Sacks staying behind to sniff at the door.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks at the door for a short while longer before also following.

Give us a tick, things are freaking out.Tessa:

Tessa walks along the corridor until she comes to a room a fourth of the way along its length.The number

on the door is 62. Tessa opens the door with the same key she used on the door to get into this place.

Alexander Hauswald follows the girl, soon followed by Sacks.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano raises a curious eyebrow.

Tessa pushes the door open and enters the room. It is a small affair. Most of the space is taken up by a

bed in the corner, and the books all over the floor. Tessa walks through the maze of tomes and lays her

cat on the bed.

"...You live alone?"
Said Alexander

"...Yeah, don't you got any parents? Or uh, siblings?"
Said Nephi

"No."
Said Tessa

"I don't."

Tessa lowers herself onto the bed next to her cat and lays a hand on the poor feline's chest.

)Net is rapidly degrading)

"...Yeah."
Said Nephi

"...We should be gettin back though. Alex?"

UrbanCritter turns to Tessa.

"Come back in two weeks, I'll pull the stitches out."
Said Alexander

You ready for stuff?

After the morning at the marshalry, Crystal needs some time to think over everything

that transpired. Her growling stomach leads her back to the hotel where she bought Cassie that steak. The food is

good here, and the atmosphere should not intrude on her contemplation overmuch.

Thin Waiter peers over his podium at Crystal for a moment.

"Here for lunch?"
Said Thin

"Yes sir."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire is not looking at the Waiter, her eyes buried in her work.

Thin Waiter dips down to grab a menu from the shelf next to him and walks around the podium to stand in

front of Crystal. He throws one arm across the room.

"Seating preference?"
Said Thin

Crystal Saint Claire looks up form her work.

"..."
Said Crystal

"Somewhere quiet... or at least, the least distracting."

Thin Waiter twiddles his mustache idly.

"There is the nook, but we do not serve there. Too much damage to the books."
Said Thin

"If I eat, may I go to the nook after?"
Said Crystal

"Of course."
Said Thin

"Then.. may I sit at the empty, long table?Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire points to the table near where the Grand Marshall and his coworkers are eating.

"Indeed madam. Would you prefer your accouterments as you dine, or shall I hold them here for

Thin Waiter:

"I would prefer they remain with me."
Said Crystal

"Less chance they are negatively impacted."

"As you wish. Follow me."
Said Thin

Thin Waiter strides off with the menu tucked under his arm.

Crystal Saint Claire follows...

Thin Waiter slides the menu onto the table and takes a set of silverware from his apron pocket. The

utensils are arranged with spectroscopic precision a moment later.

Thin Waiter extends an arm to the seat and bows his head a few degrees.

Crystal Saint Claire nods.

Crystal Saint Claire sits.

"Thank you."
Said Crystal

"Would you like a few moments to look over the menu madam?"
Said Thin

"...yes, please."
Said Crystal

"Then I shall return to my post. If you have need, call on Miss Jan."
Said Thin

Thin Waiter struts back to his podium and attends to the book on the podium.

"Thank you. I will."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire looks at the menu.

Machinist looks up from his sandwich for a few seconds to observe the new arrival. His eyes slip down to

his food after a minute analysis.

Crystal Saint Claire looks over at the Machinist.

Crystal Saint Claire tries to observe said Machinist. What does he look like he could do? Possible threat?

The menu reads, "Special today- Trout in a garlic based Oriental sauce. Sandwiches-

breaded lamb. Steaks of all sizes and cuts, cooked to order. Sides vary with dish." There is a list of beer, wine,

and soda on the back.

(That is a lot of typing)Crystal Saint Claire:

She will get...

She looks for "Miss Jan"

Machinist is dressed in a stained vest and an undershirt that has a tattoo peeking over the top. He looks

"...salad, Gustav, and?"
Said Missus

"I'll just have a bottle of red."
Said Wily

Crystal Saint Claire hears a familiar voice!

Crystal Saint Claire turns towards that voice!

"Right."
Said Missus

"...oh!"
Said Crystal

Wily Galen the skin around his eyes scrunches together for a moment in what might be a blink. He turns

to Crystal. Recognition dawns after a moment and he waves.

"Hey kid."
Said Wily

"How has your day been?"
Said Crystal

Missus Waiter looks to Crystal, then flips to a new page in her notebook.

Crystal Saint Claire glances at the soda menu.

"Pretty good, haven't had more than eight people drag my name through the mud."
Said Wily

Is there sasparilla?Crystal Saint Claire:

Yes.

"...why would people drag your name through the mud? It would be like insulting a cripple..."
Said Crystal

There is also an option to upgrade any soda to a sarsaparilla float.

Crystal Saint Claire seems genuinely confused at this

"Well, there's some folks that do insult cripples."
Said Wily

Crystal Saint Claire moves closer so that they aren't calling out across the restaurant.

"They are, almost to the person, detestable."
Said Crystal

"Mmmm."
Said Wily

"I say almost because I cannot provide empirical evidence."
Said Crystal

"What kind of evidence?"
Said Wily

Missus Waiter taps the table with her pencil.

"Empirical. Evidence that cannot-- oh! Sorry..."
Said Crystal

"Ready to order?"
Said Missus

"May I have a sasparilla, and the Gustav Special, please?"
Said Crystal

"...what is the gustav special?"

Missus Waiter scribbles the order down on her pad before looking up again.

"Is the cook's name Gustav?"
Said Crystal

"Cook's name is Duret."
Said Missus

"Gustav handles the...beverages."

"Liberal consumption of which was involved in the creation of the Gustav Special."

"...that sounds interesting."
Said Crystal

"It's a sandwich with two chicken breasts battered and covered in hot sauce. Add a few fixings

and a good slice of sharp cheddar and you got the Gustav special."

Missus Waiter:

"...That sounds delicious!"
Said Crystal

"...Would you mind asking them to be gentle, with the heat?"

"No problem."
Said Missus

"...Thank you!"
Said Crystal

"That all?"
Said Missus

"Y-yes, ma'am."
Said Crystal

"Right, should have it out in a couple minutes."
Said Missus

Missus Waiter turns on her heel and slumps off towards the counter at the back.

Crystal Saint Claire nods, and brings her workbook up onto the counter.

She's on a page with... math... on it.Crystal Saint Claire:

Fat Waiter pops out of the small doorway that leads behind the counter with visible effort. He bounces

over to the table where Galen and the rest of the marshalry crew sit with a tray of drinks held aloft by one

"Your dwinks siws and mademoiselle."
Said Fat

("Mawwiage... Twue wove...")Crystal Saint Claire:

Fat Waiter sets down a beer, a chilled bottle of wine, and a glass of tea.

Fat Waiter shifts his weight and angles himself towards Crystal's table, momentum takes care of the rest.

Fat Waiter sets a bottle of sarsaparilla down onto the tabletop.

"Enjoy youw bevewage deaw."
Said Fat

"Thank you, sir!"
Said Crystal

"...are you Gustav?"

Fat Waiter tucks the tray under his arm.

"Yes, I am the illustwious Gustav."
Said Fat

"I suppose you heawd of me by way of the stowy of my cweation?"

(I think double L's might turn to Ws as well)Crystal Saint Claire:

("The Iwwustwious Gustav"

"Excewent, it is a mastewpiece. I'm suwe you'll love it."
Said Fat

"...if there are no more wequests?"

"I have none, at present. Unless you have a suggestion for a drink that would best

accompany this meal?"

Crystal Saint Claire:

The math on the page is... as follows.

There's other stuff there, but most of it is... illegible.

"A good heawty stout best accompanies the Gustav I find."
Said Fat

"What if one is fifteen?"
Said Crystal

"...What does that have to do with it?"
Said Fat

"I am not accustomed to alcohol..."
Said Crystal

"Ah, ah, I apowogize."
Said Fat

"In that case, I would have a woot beew."

"Ow a cweam soda."

"I will try some Cream Soda, then..?"
Said Crystal

"Excewent choice, I wiw bwing it with your meal."
Said Fat

"Thank you, sir!"
Said Crystal

Fat Waiter smiles as he bounces back to his spot behind the counter.

(Probably going to stop here for the moment.)Fat Waiter:

(You too.)Fat Waiter:

"I can pay for mine."

"Party of four?"
Said Thin

"Eeeyup."
Said Cassie-May

"Any preference for seating?"
Said Thin

Cassie-May O'Brien looked to the others

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers shakes her head. "Not really, far as Ah'm concerned."

((NO DOGS!))Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

Sacks is waiting outside.

((Poor boy))Alexander Hauswald:

You better bring him some scraps or he's gonna be pissed.

"Guess we're gunna be takin' seats at tha' large table?"
Said Cassie-May

Thin Waiter slides four menus out from the shelf and tucks the stack under his right arm.

"Of course, follow me."
Said Thin

Thin Waiter spreads the menus and silverware out for four places.

"Once you are ready to order, call for Miss Jan."
Said Thin

Alexander Hauswald nods, sitting down in front of Cassie.

Cassie-May O'Brien looks over her shoulder

Cassie-May O'Brien nods and tips her hat to the Marshall and his lackeys before removing it from her

head and placing on the table next to her

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers watches Alexander walk around and up onto the table

((jk))Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

Overmarshal Fossifer has his nose buried too deep in a sandwich to notice at the moment.

Alexander Hauswald just watches the little tea party from his spot by the table.

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers also removes her hat and sets it next to her

"...Guess Deadmen's gotta eat too."
Said Alexander

Thin Waiter strides back over to his podium.

Alexander Hauswald has no hat to remove.

Wily Galen is busying himself with a bottle of red wine. There seems to be no food on his portion of the

(That was a hat?)Alexander Hauswald:

( :3)Alexander Hauswald:

"...there simply must be a reason for it. It's been going from best to worst."
Said Secretary

Cassie-May O'Brien listens in

Wily Galen swirls his bottle of wine a few times before taking a gulp.

"Why the hell would anyone go from best to worst?"
Said Wily

"And how would they know who the best is and the worst is?"

Alexander Hauswald just listens silently, looking at the menu.

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers listens as well

The menu reads, "Special today- Trout in a garlic based Oriental sauce. Sandwiches-

breaded lamb. Steaks of all sizes and cuts, cooked to order. Sides vary with dish." There is a list of beer, wine,

and soda on the back.

"...Sacks is going to like this."
Said Alexander

Cassie-May O'Brien glances on the prices.

Overmarshal Fossifer sets his sandwich down and wipes his mouth with a stained handkerchief.

There are no prices listed.

"..."
Said Cassie-May

"When we know more, we'll see to it."
Said Overmarshal

"Well, we already know quite a bit."
Said Secretary

Cassie-May O'Brien mentally guesses whatever the price is, it can't extend five bucks for her.

"When we know more useful things."
Said Overmarshal

One, three, carry the eight....

Stick to the sandwiches and beer.

"I think I'm ready to order."
Said Alexander

Missus Waiter walks over to the new dinner party with steps that suck enthusiasm from the air.

"Ready to order?"
Said Missus

Cassie-May O'Brien turned to the waitress.

"Whut's tha' Gustav Speshiul?"
Said Cassie-May

"Two chicken breasts battered and fried with hot sauce, melted sharp cheddar, all stuffed into a

soft brioche bun."

Missus Waiter:

"...What's brioche?"
Said Alexander

"Just think fancy bread."
Said Missus

"An' how much izzat?"
Said Callie

"Seventy five cents."
Said Missus

"Well shoot, Ah'll do one of those!"
Said Callie

"...How hot of a sauce we talkin'?"
Said Cassie-May

"Hot as you like it."
Said Missus

"... How much for a steak in a bun and another, rare on the side?"
Said Alexander

Missus Waiter taps her pencil against her pad for a moment.

"Two dollars and fifty."
Said Missus

"And with beer?"
Said Alexander

"Depends on the beer."
Said Missus

"Ah'm gunna take tha' un'. Go spicy enough to make meh regret bein' born. An' also

Reuben an' a good pint of beer."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Missus Waiter scribbles on her pad for three seconds.

"Something good.Alexander Hauswald:

...Same sauce she's having, if I can."

"An' Ah'll do a pint of beer too."
Said Callie

Missus Waiter scribbles for a good five seconds as she takes down the rest of the orders.

"I'll just let Gustav pick."
Said Missus

"That all?"

'cuz according to Discord he's playing killing floor but discord was wrong before

Missus Waiter taps her foot to a slow beat of impatience.

"...Jus' give th' beanpole th' greasiest thing y'all got, he needs sum' meat on them bones."
Said Cassie-May

"I'm sure Duret will be happy to hear that."
Said Missus

Alexander Hauswald snaps his fingers beside Nephi's ear.

"..."
Said Alexander

Missus Waiter toddles off with the orders towards the table at the back.

(two seconds)Alexander Hauswald:

I'm here for now but I'm going to have to BRB for a significiant period now to do some emergency

drink shopping.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano seemed to have a rough night for some reason.

"...Ah am before mah... eighth coffee, Ah think."
Said Cassie-May

"...How is your heart still working."
Said Alexander

"Overtahme."
Said Cassie-May

"Good way to live with a foot in the grave."
Said Nephi

"...Don't we all?"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien drummed her fingers on the table, suddenly lost in thought.

"...Guess so."
Said Nephi

"Some more than others."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald looks down, pulling a card from his pocket and idly examining it.

"'...Got weirdest damn dreams last night."
Said Cassie-May

"How weird?"
Said Alexander

At the top of the stairs are the back of the hotel, a door opens. Hooting voices, music,

and stamping boots drift through the portal as a woman holding a half empty bottle of champagne stands under

the lintel.

"Ah dun' dream Ah wuz sum' kinda flamin' corpse smokin' an' investig-"
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Nephi

"..."
Said Alexander

"This gonna be one'a dem shows pop always warned me about?"
Said Nephi

"Sure hope it's gunna."
Said Cassie-May

Alexander Hauswald looks interested in what Cassie says before turning to the show.

"...Well now."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks at Cassie with an unamused expression.

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers sits back and watches the show

"....Kid."
Said Alexander

"How old are you?"

"Nineteen, sir!"
Said Nephi

"Then you're old enough to know right from wrong."
Said Alexander

"Known since I was eight, sir.":Nephi "
Said Longiron

Rockett Rimbjob chuckles a little to herself, taking a sip from the bottle as she looks over her shoulder at

the doorway. "See y'all later, fellas~!" she calls out, smiling a sly grin. Her dress has slipped down past

her shoulders, revealing a remarkable amount of chest and bare skin to any onlookers. Her dress, tight

and short, is well-kept, and... almost up to her knees. Let's say it

's 'light'.Rockett Rimbjob:

((...I'm sorry, her name is WHAT))Alexander Hauswald:

Obviously not her real name.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

((I'm grinning atupidly))Cassie-May O'Brien:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks at the madame, turns more red, then suddenly takes an extreme interest in

the composition of the table.

I honestly feel like this tavern needs more patrons.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

i'D LIKE IT IF YOU MOVED ME BECAUSE i'M WORKING WITH A MOUSEPAD(From Rockett Rimbjob):

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers looks at Nephi and chuckles. "What, y'never seen a bar show b'fore?"

"...M'never been to a bar..."
Said Nephi

Cassie-May O'Brien whistles through her teeth.

"...Eeeeyup, tha's th' kinda gal yer pops warned yew 'bout, kid."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano STARES AT THE WOOD

Alexander Hauswald cracks a smile. You think.

oh he gonna be starin at wood alrightCassie-May O'Brien:

"I'll be seeing you in ma dreams tonight darlin'!" Calls one voice through the doorway.

The statement is punctuated by a smashing bottle.

"Ma'am's right, Ah'm tha kinda girl ya papa prays ya never see."
Said Rockett

"Seein' lot of yew, sugercube."
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimbjob glances once more at the doorway, before taking her seat.

why am I here(From Rockett Rimbjob):

Cassie-May O'Brien moves her hat

"..."
Said Nephi

"Damn right you are. Like what ya see, darlin'?"
Said Rockett

Nephi "Longiron" Delano FROWNS and scoots closer to Alex for protection.

Alexander Hauswald nods at the newcomer. And also at the floating ghost hat.

"Unless y'all packin' a sausage on eggs under tha' skirt, nawt really."
Said Cassie-May

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is visibly sweating.

"Packin' a whole lot more'n that."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimbjob looks at Nephi.

Working with a few clients to pay the bills while the marshalry work is dry. There's been a run of

inexplicable deaths.

(To Scotty):

"..."
Said Nephi

"...Someone had an eyeful, didn't he?"
Said Rockett

"Ah think he's gunna faint, sugercube."
Said Cassie-May

Alexander Hauswald looks at Nephi for a second. And then at Rockett.

The hotel is close in case she gets called to her other job and it has nice beds.(To Scotty):

"Kid's new."
Said Alexander

"To... everything."

"...shucks. Ah ain't that good lookin', am Ah? He must be new t--"
Said Rockett

Nephi "Longiron" Delano steels himself, taking a deep breath and then releasing it.

"Yep. Y'poor thang."
Said Rockett

"M"JUST NOT FROM ROUND HERE KAY?"
Said Nephi

"Don't be shy, fella. Ain't wrong ta--"
Said Rockett

Nephi "Longiron" Delano says, the words tumbling right outta his mouth.

Alexander Hauswald blinks in surprise.

"... Lower the volume, kid."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano coughs, then straightens, doing so.

"If y'all kiss him, he's gunna git redder than apples in th' Fall."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Alexander

"Mercy May, you must be a hoot in tha hay."
Said Rockett

Alexander Hauswald grins. An actual grin, you guys.

Rockett Rimbjob smiles at Nephi.

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers chuckles again, watching all this unfold

Nephi "Longiron" Delano does his damndest not to look.

"If I tell you it's his birthday, will you make it harder on him?"
Said Alexander

Rockett Rimbjob walks over.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano notices her walking over.

Fat Waiter approaches the table in an odd motion that looks like an approaching storm of flab held in

check only by the starch in his white shirt. He has a tray of drinks in one hand and a tray of food in the

Rockett Rimbjob leans forward, resting on her elbows.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks normal. Ish.

Rockett Rimbjob gives him a niiiiiice good look at her cleavage.

"Ah'm gunna buy yew a beer if y'all sit in his lap."
Said Cassie-May

Nephi "Longiron" Delano screams internally.

"Kid. Kid, it's okay."
Said Alexander

"Ah'll buy ya one too! Double 'r nothin'."
Said Callie

Fat Waiter pauses in deference to Rockett.

"She won't bite."
Said Alexander

"I think."

"Probableh."
Said Cassie-May

"Ah won't bite, sweetie. Quite tha opposite~"
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimbjob sits down right next to him.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano stiffens like a board as she approaches.

Cassie-May O'Brien snickers

Rockett Rimbjob gets reeeeal close, and slides a leg over his.

"H-h-h-owdy ma'am."
Said Nephi

Alexander Hauswald is actively trying not to laugh.

"Lovely eeeevenin."
Said Nephi

"Howdy stud."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimbjob places her hand on his.

Rockett Rimbjob holds it right to her ass.

Cassie-May O'Brien covers her mouth with her fist to hide the grin and stifle giggles.

"How you doin~?"
Said Rockett

Fat Waiter chuckles to himself as he sets both trays down. His hands flit to his mustache and he twists

the end of it to calm his fidgeting hand.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano stares straight ahead. Thinkin about Granny Delano lookin right at him with her

piercing pioneer eyes and puritanical spirit.

"You ain't never had a tussle with a missus, have ya, sweetie..?"
Said Rockett

"J-j-j-just tryin to enjoy a nice m-meal with my new Marshal friends..."
Said Nephi

"You can enjoy a meal with me too, ya know. We can be good friends..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimbjob wraps her arms around his neck and slips her other leg onto his lap.

"N-nope! I-I'm a good boy f-from Utah and-"
Said Nephi

"Eeeyup, sum' claw chowder Ah suppose."
Said Cassie-May

"M-madame, I must ask you to please-"
Said Nephi

"Nice an' moist. Hyuk!"
Said Cassie-May

Nephi "Longiron" Delano faints

Wily Galen appears to be dying a slow death of giggles.

"..."
Said Rockett

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers laughs at what Cassie says

Nephi "Longiron" Delano straight up faints.

Rockett Rimbjob holds her mouth to her hand and starts -laughing.-

Alexander Hauswald starts laughing. Hard. You weren't aware he's capable of showing this much

"...Ah think Ah did a good job..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimbjob looks at the others at the table. "Now, about them beers..."

"...Sweet Mary Magdalene, Ah didn' think he'd actually faint."
Said Cassie-May

Be back soon.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Cassie-May O'Brien stands up and peers over the table.

"You always do a good job Miss Rockett."
Said Fat

"Ah try~"
Said Rockett

"And you always bring in extra business."
Said Fat

"Jus' how much he's packin' if all th' blood from his head went there?"
Said Cassie-May

"Ah'm a girl of my word, Ah owe ya a beer."
Said Callie

Alexander Hauswald manages to catch his breath.

"..."
Said Rockett

"Don't think that's what it was."
Said Alexander

"Shall I fetch you your usual aperitif?"
Said Fat

Rockett Rimbjob peeks at Nephis 'rocket'

"Two beers. One from meh too!"
Said Cassie-May

"Make it three."
Said Alexander

"Poor fella. Mama never told 'em 'bout that thing under 'is trousers, Ah reckon."

"Cassie-May O'Brien, missus Rockett."
Said Cassie-May

"Cassie-May. Pleasure."
Said Rockett

"Alexander Hauswald."
Said Alexander

"Callie Mathers."
Said Callie

"Right away, your food and beverages are on the trays."
Said Fat

"Call meh jus' Cassie. Or Cass."
Said Cassie-May

"I will return in a moment with the additional libations and take the trays with me."
Said Fat

"Thank y'all! Let's see how spicy y'all made tha' special of yers."
Said Cassie-May

"...Ah actually feel kinda bad for tha poor boy."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimbjob looks at Nephi one more time.

"Don't be."
Said Alexander

"He from Deseret?"
Said Rockett

"...Think he's Mormon."
Said Alexander

"Eeeeeeeeeeeeeyup."
Said Cassie-May

"Yeah, that might be it."
Said Rockett

Fat Waiter returns to the table with a chilled pitcher of dark ale in one hand and a cadre of frosty mugs in

the other.

"So how y'all doin' t'night? What brings ya here ta Missouri?"
Said Rockett

"Job offer. We're the new marshals."
Said Alexander

Rockett Rimbjob raises her brows.

"New marshals?"
Said Rockett

Fat Waiter sets both down in the middle of the table and takes the silvery serving trays back to his post

behind the counter.

would she know about this also who's a marshal(From Rockett Rimbjob):

"Eeeyup. Jus' got ourselves our stars."
Said Cassie-May

also is rockett in law enforcement at all(From Rockett Rimbjob):

also what's the waiter's name(From Rockett Rimbjob):

Cassie-May O'Brien pushed the platters with food to respective owners and took a huge gulp of her beer.

Rockett Rimbjob grabs her own beer happily.

"Ain't that somethin'."
Said Rockett

Alexander Hauswald set the plate with the rare steak aside, grabbing his own steak-in-a-bun.

Cassie-May O'Brien cracked her fingers and stared at the extra spicy Gustav Special.

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers takes a bite of her sandwich and washes it down with a gulp of beer

"...Tally ho."
Said Cassie-May

"Asked for us specifically, too."
Said Alexander

Cassie-May O'Brien ate a forkful.

"Really."
Said Rockett

"Who'd ya impress?"

"Or who'd ya blow?"

Alexander Hauswald looks at Cassie, judging her reaction before taking a bite from his sandwich.

Alexander Hauswald shrugs at Rockett.

Yep. The Marshals are the law in the neutral territories. Kansas City is their base of operations. They

also hire out their services to other places if the price is right. Rockett works for the marshalry sometimes when

there's a job that suits the taste of her and her pocketbook. The fat one is Gustav, he does the drinks.. The woman

one is Jan, she does the not wanting to be here. The thin one is Einhart, he runs most of the hotel. The cook's

name is Duret.

(To Scotty):

Cassie-May O'Brien is waiting for Doc's decision

"Just got the letter one day. Not exactly well known before."
Said Alexander

"Hey, Gustav!"
Said she

"Same here. Ah mean, Ah'd done some Ranger work b'fore."
Said Callie

Fat Waiter perks up from where he was pouring himself a bottle of wine, pouring it down his throat

straight from the bottle.

"Can a bring me a payback, honeydoll?"
Said Rockett

a cigar(From Rockett Rimbjob):

Fat Waiter nods for a moment before disappearing through the doors to, assumedly, the kitchen.

"...Eh, from whut Ah can take, each of us got sum' fun adventures under our belts."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien ate another forkful.

"..."
Said Alexander

"Ain' half bad. Coulda stand ta be spicier."
Said Cassie-May

Alexander Hauswald took a bite from his own sandwich, slowly reaching for the beer.

"But. Ah'm familiar with tha Marshals. They usually bring in good folk, but... they been lax

Rockett Rimbjob:

"Y'all ain't second-rate, are ya?"

"Or crooks? Ah hate crooks."

Cassie-May O'Brien looked at Rockett

Fat Waiter pops back out and heads over to Rockett with a cigar in one hand and a matchbook in the

"I think we're the new generation."
Said Alexander

Rockett Rimbjob takes the cigar and matchbook, nodding to him once.

Fat Waiter proffers the payback.

"Thank ya kindly."
Said Rockett

"Ain' no second-rate crook, sugercube."
Said Cassie-May

Fat Waiter bows with one arm held over his paunch, and retires to his drinking.

"Good ta hear. Ah take it ya gonna prove that ta me soon, then."
Said Rockett

"Somethin' tells me it ain't a coincidence y'all showed up right now, right here."

Alexander Hauswald lifts a brow.

"Y'all knew them deposed marshals, missus Rockett?"
Said Cassie-May

"They was mah steady income, friends, an' colleagues -- sure as shit Ah knew 'em."
Said Rockett

The spiciness appears to have been tailored to be not too terrifying, unless the fool

who ordered it asked for the spice. In that case, the spice appears mild at first, but after one good bite goes down

the hatch, it comes up from the stomach like a volcanic eruption.

Rockett Rimbjob lights her thin cigar and gives it a few puffs to get it burning.

Cassie-May O'Brien felt her gut gurgle

Cassie-May O'Brien punched it

Cassie-May O'Brien gulped more beer

Alexander Hauswald pauses.

"...slow burnin'."
Said Cassie-May

"Ah'm startin' ta like this."

Alexander Hauswald immediately downed his ownbeer, slowly setting the sandwich down.

"...This is good."
Said Alexander

Cassie gains new Trait: Masochist.

Rockett Rimbjob takes another gulp of her beer.

them lateleh? Someone them stepped on them toes ?"

Cassie-May O'Brien:

do I know anything from being a nosy whore(From Rockett Rimbjob):

Information seems scant. Dead marshals tell no tales. All that anyone seems to know right now is

that they appear to be dying in the line of work. There's something real goddamn fishy about that though and not a

lot has been done to hide it. Just enough is wrong to know there's something up without enough being wrong to

find out what the cause is.

(To Scotty):

Like Jones a couple months ago. He was a good shooter, and a tough bastard to kill. Died in a

shootout with some strange desperado that rolled into town and rolled out soon as Jones was cold.

(To Scotty):

(Gonna be away for a bit.)

"Well. Ah wish Ah could tell ya anythin' more'n Ah already know. Much as Ah hate ta say it,

dead marshals tell no tales. Fishier'n an unwashed ham-holster, an' it's infuriatin' that Ah ain't been able ta do

nothin' about it."

Rockett Rimbjob:

"Ah'm employed, but in mah line of work, business an' pleasure are one an' tha same -- jus' so happens ya get ta

know these folks real well. Ah'd go right ahead an' say Ah made a few good friends. Like Jones, couple months

ago -- tough bastard, good shot with any gun he held, tougher'n a brick shithouse. Died in a shootout, of all things,

with some... desperado that rolled in, an' was gone like a fart in tha wind soon as Jones was glass-eyed."

"Been diggin' fer a lot more than gold lately. Comin' up drier'n a nun's nasties."

"...My condolences."
Said Alexander

"Y'all gonna try'n set this straight 'fore ya end up in a grave, right?"
Said Rockett

"Darn right."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald looks at Cassie.

Rockett Rimbjob seems sincere, and oddly solemn, concerning the number of drinks in front of her and

the bulging coinpurse on her hip.

"Helping's our job, miss."
Said Alexander

"Ah didn' git this job ta sit 'round an' fart in th' table. Whut can yew tell us 'bout tha' basterd

tha' put yer Jones six feet under?"

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Anything at all. No matter how minor."
Said Alexander

Rockett Rimbjob looks at Cassie. "Took tha phrase 'shoot an' scoot' ta whole new levels. But 'side from 'is

tha top of mah head."

"Nawt even his looks?"
Said Cassie-May

"Dead eye. That his aiming or his actual eye?"
Said Alexander

"Aimin'. Motherfucker outshot Jones, an' Ah was hard-pressed ta outshoot 'em mahself."
Said Rockett

"An' no. Didn't see 'em. Ah was here when it happened."

"...Where'd it happen, then?"
Said Alexander

where happen(From Rockett Rimbjob):

"Tha clinic. Jones was goin' in ta get bled, an'..."
Said Rockett

"...well. Sure as hell got bled all right."

"Right. How long ago? Is anyone who worked that day still working?"
Said Alexander

"Hm."
Said Cassie-May

"Couple months ago. Doc Mitchell's high-tailed it ta Dodge."
Said Rockett

"Don't blame 'em, bastard just about got shot."

"...Guess that's our first witness, Cass."
Said Alexander

The only thing anyone can say about the stranger is that his clothes were ragged, and his hat was

black as coal.

(To Scotty):

"Doc Mitchell in Dodge. Y'all know of anyun' else who coulda see th' scene?"
Said Cassie-May

"...Ah actually heard one thing from mah last buyer. But it ain't nothin' surprisin' -- he was one

of them egotistical, shady bastards, with ragged clothes an' one of them ugly black hats."

Rockett Rimbjob:

"An' no. Ain't nobody else saw this 'cept tha killer."

"...What'd he say?"
Said Alexander

I'm sorry I improv'd so much I hope it's fine(From Rockett Rimbjob):

Yer good.(To Scotty):

"That's what he said. That's what he was wearin'."
Said Rockett

"Typical dumbshit desperado outfit that makes 'em feel tough."

"...Hrm."
Said Alexander

"So far we whittled it down to..."

'hey so do you know this'(From Rockett Rimbjob):

'UH'(From Rockett Rimbjob):

"...Every desperado in the west."
Said Alexander

Rockett Rimbjob nods once.

"Yup."
Said Rockett

"Hence mah frustration."

"Naw. Ev'ry fast one."
Said Cassie-May

"Here's hoping Doc Mitchell can say something."
Said Alexander

"...That's every living one, Cass."

"Slow ones don't stay living."

Gave me an excuse to have Doc Mitchell in this.(To Scotty):

"Ah heard tha' buncha patooey too, but Ah'll let yew know most desperados ain' actively

lookin' 'round fer cretins faster than them."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"It's th' real fast un's tha' flaunt it."

I did something I hoped you'd like(From Rockett Rimbjob):

You done did good Scotty, like I knew you would.(To Scotty):

"Either way."
Said Alexander

"An' if missus Rockett here's sayin; tha' basterd wuz fast... Act'alleh, how good wit' th' gun

are yew, sugercube?"

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Rockett Rimbjob puffs from her cigar, letting out a quiet sigh.

Alexander Hauswald taps his holster.

"Usually folks pay me ta find that out, hun."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien aimed that last question at Rockett of course.

"Depends on how generous the manitou are."
Said Alexander

Rockett Rimbjob smirks slyly ar Cass.

Cassie-May O'Brien gives her the "are you serious now" look.

Rockett Rimbjob just starts laughing.

Rockett Rimbjob reaches down to her waist and hikes her skirt.

Alexander Hauswald looks away all of a sudden.

"Sugercube, it's th' fainted kid callin' himself th' Longiron."
Said Cassie-May

"An' now Ah'm tryin' real hard ta avoid makin' jokes 'bout cocki

cockin' Winchesters."

Rockett Rimbjob reaches down and slips something out of a thigh holster.

Did you like your intro, by the by?(To Scotty):

"An' whether y'all prefer derrngers or rifles an' consarn it."
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimbjob sets down an enormous derringer on the counter -- a good five inch long barrel, with a

bore bigger than any reasonable fellow would consider good for a handgun.

Cassie-May O'Brien pinched the bridge of her nose and snorted a laugh.

"...We're all adults here."
Said Alexander

Rockett Rimbjob slides it over to Cass. Two bullets spill out of the chamber and roll across the chable --

very large bullets, in fact.

Alexander Hauswald examines the gun curiously.

Cassie-May O'Brien stared at the derringer.

"...What IS that?"
Said Alexander

Cassie-May O'Brien stared at Rockett.

Cassie-May O'Brien stared at her skirt.

"Fifty-ninety sharps derringer. Custom-made. Bond arms, straight from Houston."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimbjob shuffles her skirt back down.

"..Y'all spendin' fortune on vaseline ta hide tha' thing there, huh?"
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald facepalms.

"You bet."
Said Rockett

"Goddammit."
Said Alexander

(Accidentally pressed that button on my mouse that goes back a page))Alexander Hauswald:

else y'all can tell us? Sumthin

odd goin' 'round them parts? Odder than usual."

Cassie-May O'Brien motioned with her head to the obvious corpse at the Marshall's table.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is now pretending to be unconscious.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano appears to have been pretending for some time.

Rockett Rimbjob gestures for Cassie to slide the gun back.

Wily Galen raises his bottle of wine.

lyin' Eyes fuckoCassie-May O'Brien:

Alexander Hauswald pokes the kid.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is not doing it very well

"Love you too sweetheart."
Said Wily

"...Kid."
Said Alexander

Cassie-May O'Brien returns the gun

"Get up."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano occasionally peeks one eye open to see if Rockett is still there.

"Whut, he up?"
Said Cassie-May

"Mhuhhwhuzza?"
Said Nephi

Nephi, you're not sure if all of her is still there, but her tits certainly are.

"Cassie, can Ah have mah two-shooter back?"
Said Rockett

"You're a grown man and a good christian. You shouldn't be worried just because there's a

pretty lady around."

Alexander Hauswald:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano frowns.

"Ah slid it over ta yew, sugercube."
Said Cassie-May

"Now get up and grow a pair."
Said Alexander

Cassie-May O'Brien pointed at the gun on the other side of the table.

"..."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano grumbles.

Rockett Rimbjob looks.

"...Sorry. Ah'm blind."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimbjob takes it.

Rockett Rimbjob slides it back to her thigh.

Rockett Rimbjob gives Nephi a nice look at her shapely legs as she does.

Those are some hot games Nephi.

Hot gams.

"Ah wouldn' tell, wit' eyes tha' pretty."
Said Cassie-May

Stupid, bloody autocorrect.

Rockett Rimbjob winks at Cass.

Cassie-May O'Brien winks back.

"Shame tha only one here that's got enough balls ta make a move's tha only one that ain't

packin' no heat."

Rockett Rimbjob:

"You two could take notes from her."

"Sugercube. Ah got more heat y'all can handle."
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimbjob looks at the two men at the table.

"Try me."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien snickered.

"No offense. You're not my type."
Said Alexander

Obviously gay, in that case.(To Scotty):

"You ain't mine neither. Don't mean Ah can't admire that there jawline."
Said Rockett

"Ah bet you got yer sights on this cutie here, now, don't ya?"

"Yew can't, it's hidden under all tha' beard."
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimbjob gestures to Nephi.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano shakes his head.

Alexander Hauswald looks at Rockett.

"No."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano closes his eyes and breathes deep.

Rockett Rimbjob starts -giggling-

"Nonononono."
Said Nephi

"Even if I did. Don't think he does."
Said Alexander

Cassie-May O'Brien shook her head with a grin.

"Ah gotta see yew interact wit' Whitney."
Said Cassie-May

"Whitney?"
Said Rockett

"Anuther new Marshall, ain' here now. Lovely lilCassie-May O'Brien:

"She's a missionary."
Said Alexander

"Makes me look like yer average cowpoke in comparison."
Said Nephi

wit' one hand an' this table wit' th' other."Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Ah. One'a them types. Whole lotta woman?"
Said Rockett

"Very much so."
Said Alexander

"Head taller than yew, an' no ounce of fat outta place on her."
Said Cassie-May

"Makes meh feel all self-conscious, purdy gals all 'round."

Cassie-May O'Brien was dressed like a man, somewhat wiry, and bags under her eyes were probably

bigger than her breasts.

"Think you got better things to be self-conscious about."
Said Alexander

"Ah was about ta say."
Said Rockett

"You jus' signed up ta be a marshal. An' one look at you, an' Ah can say yer ass is tha least of yer problems, hun."

Rockett Rimbjob takes a sip of her beer and another puff from her cigar.

"Oi, mah arse is damn perfect."
Said Cassie-May

"That's what Ah jus' said."
Said Rockett

Alexander Hauswald stays quiet on that one.

"Ya ears, though, could use some work..."
Said Rockett

Nephi "Longiron" Delano stays very quiet, having gone back to staring at the table.

Rockett Rimbjob pats Nephi's thigh.

"...Whut's wrong with mah ears?"
Said Cassie-May

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has not visibly relax-

"Come on, fella. Don't be shy. Say somethin'."
Said Rockett

"What's wrong with her ears?"
Said Alexander

"...M-mah name's Nephi."
Said Nephi

"W-what's yers?"

"Nice ta meet ya Nephi."
Said Rockett

"They call me Rockett. Rockett Rimbjob."

Cassie-May O'Brien took a sip of beer

Rockett Rimbjob says this as if it were totally normal.

"...They do not."
Said Nephi

Cassie-May O'Brien did a spit-take into the mug

Alexander Hauswald took a sip on his beer.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano says matter of factly.

Alexander Hauswald chokes on said beer.

'Pfpth whut?"Cassie-May O'Brien:

"You can jus' call me Rocket, though, sweetie."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimbjob giggles.

"That ain't possible."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano stares back into the table.

"Rockett Rimbjob."
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimbjob raises her eyebrows, and glances at the mostly-empty bottle of champagne on the table.

Alexander Hauswald tries to cough and clear his airway, looking bewildered.

"Darn tootin'."
Said Cassie-May

"Well."
Said Rockett

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks to Alex with eyes pleading for help

"Any one of them fellas upstairs'd tell ya true."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien is visibly biting her tongue at this point

Alexander Hauswald looks back at Nephi and shrugs.

"...Very bold, miss."
Said Alexander

"Like mah beer an' mah bullridin'."
Said Rockett

"Explains tha' filthy lamguage/"
Said Cassie-May

"...Pffft."
Said Nephi

Rockett Rimbjob gulps a couple times.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano actually laughs, relaxing just a tiny bit.

Rockett Rimbjob sets her mug down and looks at Cass.

"Hun Ah lost mah class tha moment Ah booked it from home, Ah ain't gonna act proper in a

place like this."

Rockett Rimbjob:

"Now. If Ah was in somewhere a little less rustic? Or Ah was gettin' payed a lot more? Maybe. Ah ain't bad at

holdin' up a classy facade."

"Ah jus' dont wanna."

Rockett Rimbjob looks at the bar around her.

"...this place don't exactly scream class, neither."
Said Rockett

"This whole town don't scream class, ma'am."
Said Nephi

"No offense."

"Welcome ta Kansas City."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimbjob shrugs, and gulps once more from her mug.

"Ah ain' un' fer judgin' an' condemnin', sugercube. So far, Ah gotta tell yew y'all charmed

meh good."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"...Ah miss Deseret."
Said Nephi

"Ah don't," she says, right after Nephi butts in.Rockett Rimbjob:

"Business was awful there."

"Folks were nice though."

"...You been there? A-"
Said Nephi

"..."
Said Alexander

"Mostly."
Said Rockett

Alexander Hauswald tries to stifle another laughter.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano actually managed to look her in the face for that one fleeting moment before

turning back to the table and turning red.

"...Y'didn't happen to entertain a fella named Helaman while you were there, did

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"...My brother has a way of findin out where the... Ladies o'the evenin are."

"Big strong guy. Tanned. Meaty."

"...was he tha Helaman with tha tricorne? Or tha one with tha silver-toed boots? Or was he tha

Helaman with tha big, meaty--"

Rockett Rimbjob:

"..."
Said Alexander

"...Dern it."
Said Nephi

Alexander Hauswald loses it.

Congratulations.

You played yourself.

"Welp, sugercube, y'all got th' opportunity ta show who's got th' longer iron."
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimbjob smiles as Alex loses it.

"NO."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano croaks out.

"Ah already looked when his head hit tha deck."
Said Rockett

"Verdict?"
Said Cassie-May

"...Don't you say a word ma'am."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano grumps.

"Please don't."
Said Alexander

"Don't think my heart can handle it."

"AnCassie-May O'Brien:

yew wuz concerned 'bout mine!"

"Longer don't mean better. One'a them's longer, sure. One of 'em's 'bout twice as thick

Rockett Rimbjob:

"Ah'll let ya guess who's who."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano breathes out. Then in. Then-

"Haven't laughed this hard for three years."
Said Alexander

"Aight I'm done."
Said Nephi

Alexander Hauswald 's smile fades.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano stands up, throws down a couple dollars, then walks right the hell out.

Cassie-May O'Brien snickered into her booze.

Rockett Rimbjob looks at Nephi as he waltzes out.

"...Since my brother's-"
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads outside to get some air.

"...Guess he can't be pushed that far."
Said Alexander

"Poor fella. Mormons really oughta stop tha whole 'sex is tha dance of tha devil' bullshit."
Said Rockett

Sacks is sitting next to the entrance.

"Ah bet he went ta polish his rifle."
Said Cassie-May

Nephi "Longiron" Delano sits down with Sacks.

"Odd folk. Odd religion. Odd place, Deseret."
Said Rockett

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks to the dog for sympathy.

'Feel bad for a lot of 'em."Rockett Rimbjob:

"Ahll go out an' apologize in a bit. Maybe smooch 'is cheek."
Said Rockett

"I think he'd die."
Said Alexander

"...I ain't like my brother, Sacks. I'm a good boy."
Said Nephi

Sacks sniffs Nephi, and tilts his head.

"Rrrrf?"
Said Sacks

"Whut a way ta die..."
Said Cassie-May

"Yer a good boy too."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano scratches Sacks head, if he lets him.

"...Ah actually had someone die on me once."
Said Rockett

"...Gotta have helped business."
Said Alexander

"...Ah'm gonna save em too. That ivory rider... He's never going to hurt them."
Said Nephi

Sacks looks at him, deadpan, but ultimately lets him.

"...Welp. It's settled, Rockett, y'all wanna kiss Nephi, y'all gotta test on one of us first if it ain'

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"...She. It... Whatever."
Said Nephi

"...Boof."
Said Sacks

"Guy worked in a mineshat. Coughed up a lung an' keeled over right then an' there."
Said Rockett

"Good boy."
Said Nephi

"Poor bastard."
Said Rockett

Sacks gives Nephi a "quit patronizing me, Greg" look.

"Still, gewd way ta kick it."
Said Cassie-May

"...Sorry."
Said Nephi

Tessa walks with cautious steps over to the table.

Rockett Rimbjob looks.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano realizes he just apologized to a dog for being patronizing.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano blinks for a minute, then decides to stop thinking about it.

Cassie-May O'Brien looks over at the smol un.

"Was that Mister Nephi just now?"
Said Tessa

"...Can't find a bettero ne, that's for sure-"
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald recognizes the kid.

"Mister Nephi needed some fresh air, missie."
Said Rockett

"How's Grimmie?"
Said Alexander

"Grimmie is alright. I left him with Mrs. Rhodes."
Said Tessa

Sacks ... You swear he shrugged, clearly done with this. He does scooch a bit closer to Nephi.

"Good, good."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano continues scratching.

Alexander Hauswald looks at Cass and Rockett.

"Ah'll be back in a sec. Gonna make right with tha poor guy."
Said Rockett

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks up at the sky.

Tessa waves to Rockett as she goes.

"...This is Tessa. Me and Nephi saved her cat."
Said Alexander

"Tha' explains it."
Said Cassie-May

Sacks lazily wags his tail.

"...I just wanna do right by them, you know?"
Said Nephi

Rockett Rimbjob walks outside and leans against the wall next to the doorway, taking a drag from her

Rockett makes her way outside. Nephi is there, talking to a scrappy looking mutt.

"Don't worry none, sweetie. You ain't done no wrong yet."
Said Rockett

"...Stay away from the loose ladies, keep to the faith."
Said Nephi

Tessa hops up onto Rockett's recently vacated seat.

"...It's hard. Ah just..."
Said Nephi

"You ain't too upset, are ya?"
Said she

"Tryin to-"
Said Nephi

Tessa grows a little frustrated when her head barely reaches over the tabletop.

Sacks looks at the pretty lady.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano seems much calmer now, outside.

"What set off Mister Nephi?"
Said Tessa

"...Yeah. Ah'm..."
Said Nephi

Rockett Rimbjob takes a drag from her cigar.

"Ah'm sorry I reacted-"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano shakes his head and takes in a deep breath.

"...He's not too good with ladies."
Said Alexander

"Miss Rockett was a bit too forward."

"Like a two-bit buffoon."
Said Nephi

"Why is that?"
Said Tessa

"Naw. Don't worry, pal. Ah jus' ferget how sensitive Mormons can be 'bout this sorta thing."
Said Rockett

Alexander Hauswald shrugs.

"Is he not gifted enough to entice interest?"
Said Tessa

"Part of it's that Ah don't like it none, neither. Folks were real, uh..."
Said Rockett

"He's just like that."
Said Alexander

"Yeah."
Said Nephi

"...Bit of a spit in their face. Doin' what Ah want. But that don't mean Ah gotta make yer life hell,

Rockett Rimbjob:

"Peculiar."
Said Tessa

"Mmmmhm."
Said Alexander

"Yeah. It ain't yer fault, anyways. Mostly mad at my brother. Don't wanna end up like

he did."{

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Alexander Hauswald chews absentmindedly on his sandwich.

"Who are the other two ladies?"
Said Tessa

"They look adventurous."

"...that's a good ahead, yeah,"
Said she

"If he is who Ah think he is, he..."

"Or is it, look like adventurers."
Said Tessa

"He taught me everythin, and afore I left, all he'd do is go from the mad's workshops

to the bars and such, then back again in the mornin."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Livin in sin."

"Those are Cassie and Callie."
Said Alexander

"...Ah won't say nothin' too detailed. But Ah don't think it was worth tha pay. Not even close."
Said Rockett

"We're colleagues."
Said Alexander

Tessa places her hands on the table and lifter herself up to get a better view of the two.

"Well now I think yer insultin mah kin, ma'am." Nephi says this with an actually

humorous tone.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Howdy, sugercube. Ah'm th' Cassie."
Said Cassie-May

Nephi "Longiron" Delano cracks a half-smile.

"...pardon mah honesty," she says, chuckling a little.Rockett Rimbjob:

"Honesty is the best policy, after all."
Said Nephi

"You jus' keep on tha straight an' narrow. Ah'll try'n tone down tha teasin'."
Said Rockett

"Thanks, ma'am."
Said Nephi

Tessa cocks her head and looks at Cassie for a long while.

Rockett Rimbjob drops Nephi's money on the ground right next to him. Then she turns to head back

"On me."
Said Rockett

"...Aw fer pete's sake!"
Said Nephi

Sacks gets up, looking at Nephi with an amused look in his little doggy eyes.

"I been hustled ageain!"
Said Nephi

Rockett Rimbjob closes the door behind her.

"She looks like Mister Rhodes after a long night of research."
Said Tessa

Nephi "Longiron" Delano laughs.

"Which is terribly unhealthy."
Said Tessa

"She doesn't sleep much either."
Said Alexander

back inside pls(From Rockett Rimbjob):

I got it, I got it.(To Scotty):

Cassie-May O'Brien grumbled.

"...stole mah spot, did ya."
Said Rockett

"Oh, sorry."
Said Tessa

Rockett Rimbjob chuckles.

"Them's better things ta do than sleepin'."
Said Cassie-May

Tessa scoots over a few feet towards Alex.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano puts his money back in his pouches and looks to Sacks.

"...Guess she ain't so bad after all."
Said Nephi

"Sit back down, please."
Said Tessa

"Bark bark!"
Said Sacks

"Yeah, yer right Sacks."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano smiles and pats his head.

"You gonna be good out here all by yerself?"
Said Nephi

"Think I'm gonna go see what's goin down."

Rockett Rimbjob slides back into her seat, cigar-less.

Sacks barks and nods.

"Aight. We'll be out soon enough, yeah?"
Said Nephi

Tessa looks up to Rocket for a few moments longer than seems normal.

"What happened to your stogie Miss?"
Said Tessa

Nephi "Longiron" Delano stends up and stretches, then heads back inside.

"Finished it."
Said Rockett

Sacks focuses on his food on the meanwhile.

"Tasted good."
Said Rockett

((That was me))Alexander Hauswald:

"You smoke fast."
Said Tessa

"Ah had it for a good while."
Said Rockett

"Is it better to smoke fast or slow?"
Said Tessa

"Aight folks, feelin better now."
Said Nephi

"An' those are smaller cigars, too. Better ta smoke slow, but... sometimes yer like me, an'

Rockett Rimbjob:

"Don't be like me, sweetie."

"I don't think I have the assets for your profession."
Said Tessa

"So, while I been busy... Studyin the table... We figure out our first job?"
Said Nephi

Cassie-May O'Brien coughed a laugh into her beer

"Yeah."
Said Alexander

"I hope not, at least."
Said Tessa

"Fill me in?"
Said Nephi

"Now or later. You stick to tha straight an' narrow, you," she says to the little girl, before turning

back to her drinks.

Rockett Rimbjob:

"Rockett here lost one of her friends. We're heading to Doc Mitchell's to question him

about the desperado that killed him."

Alexander Hauswald:

"One?"
Said Rockett

"Try a dozen."

"...Yer uh... Gentlemen friends, or uh..."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano turns a bit red.

"Yer friends?"
Said Nephi

"Yes an' no. They've all been marshals."
Said Rockett

"...Hmm."
Said Nephi

"...most of 'em were bedfellas though. But that ain't important."
Said Rockett

"...Well, seems like a job for us, definitely."
Said Nephi

"Don't-don't-don't wanna know none bout that."

"Right. We about done here, fellas?"

"Ah kinda do but Ah shouldn' ask."
Said Cassie-May

"Ah won't say nothin'. Not now, front'a these two."
Said Rockett

"I got a hankerin to get stuff done and get paid."
Said Nephi

"Finish your food, kid."
Said Alexander

"...Mruh."
Said Nephi

"Don't hold your tongue on my account."
Said Tessa

"Wasting food's a sin."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano leans in and slides his plate down past Alex.

"Gettin' paid's good. Think Ah'm gunna be flat broke after this dinner here."
Said Cassie-May

"I've been told that I'm too precocious for my own good."
Said Tessa

"Mostly by Mister Lane."

"Ah'm holdin' it anyway. Little girl like you shouldn't be seein' me, let alone talkin' ta me."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien finished her two dishes in the meantime.

"Darn tootin it is."
Said Nephi

"If you say so."
Said Tessa

"...Mister Lane. Tellin' his daughter ta be innocent an' precious."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimbjob looks at Cass.

Alexander Hauswald wipes his mouth, drinking from his mug.

Rockett Rimbjob raises her brows.

"Oh, Mister Lane isn't my father."
Said Tessa

"Oh?"
Said Cassie-May

"He just tries to take care of me."
Said Tessa

"He's yer father even if y'aint blood."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien rubbed her chin.

"Hmmm..."
Said Tessa

"You'n Crystal would probably get on right as rain."
Said Nephi

"He's not your father."
Said Alexander

"He can still be your dad."

"I imagine he's sitting back there with Miss Vard trying not to look concerned and failing."
Said Tessa

Rockett Rimbjob finishes her beer, and then grabs her bottle of wine.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks to Alex with a curious expression at that.

"...Ah think Ah'll have a chat with him later."
Said Rockett

"Yew do tha'."
Said Cassie-May

"Anyhow. Been workin' all day, Ah'm right worn out. Gonna hit tha sack soon -- fer real this

Rockett Rimbjob:

"Leavin' wit'out a goodnight's kiss?"
Said Cassie-May

"You fellas don't take a step ta Dodge without lettin' me know. Ah got a score ta settle with Doc

Rockett Rimbjob:

"Y;all say yer gunna come wit' us?"
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Alexander

"Damn straight."
Said Rockett

Nephi "Longiron" Delano seems a little bit uncomfortable with that idea, but significantly less than when

miss Rockett arrived.

"Welcome aboard."
Said Cassie-May

"You'll need a better gun."
Said Alexander

"...She can borrow one'a my rifles."
Said Nephi

"Hang on."
Said Alexander

"..."
Said Rockett

"Excuse me?"

Cassie-May O'Brien blinked. Nah, too easy.

Rockett Rimbjob seems genuinely insulted.

"Guns!"
Said Nephi

"Oh...dear."
Said Tessa

"I carry a pair of rifles around."
Said Nephi

"Honey Ah can kill a man an' his horse from a mile away, tha fuck would Ah need a rifle for?"
Said Rockett

"I got a Colt navy."
Said Alexander

"Ah got a feelinCassie-May O'Brien:

"It probably doesn't shoot better, but it holds more than two shots."
Said Alexander

yew don't wanna continue this line a conversation, Alex."Cassie-May O'Brien:

"...Uh."
Said Nephi

"I believe Miss Rockett thinks that her gun is fine."
Said Tessa

"...Ah'm real confused."
Said Nephi

"What kinda second-rate marshal needs more than one, let alone two?"
Said Rockett

"...ah do."
Said Cassie-May

"It's more of a trophy than a real gun."
Said Alexander

"Y'all didn' see them things Ah shot down/"
Said Cassie-May

"At least for me."
Said Alexander

"One of em's prone to breakin. Fancy new tech from the mads back in Deseret."
Said Nephi

"Guess we'll see about that. Ain't ran inta nothin' Ah ain't been able ta kill with this."
Said Rockett

"Guess we'll find out once we head out Doc Mitchell's way, eh?"
Said Nephi

"An' Ah've been 'round tha block."
Said Rockett

"...How many things did you have to kill, exactly?"
Said Alexander

Tessa kicks her legs underneath the table as she watches the drama unfold.

"More things'n Ah've had ta ride."
Said Rockett

Nephi "Longiron" Delano scoffs.

"Hope it stays tha' way, sugercube. Anyway! Y'all go hit th' hay. Ah'm gunna go find yew

when we're gunna roll fer Doc Mitchell."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"...Duly noted."
Said Alexander

Rockett Rimbjob winks at Alex.

"Thanks, hun. Ah'll see y'all t'morrow morn'."
Said Rockett

"Right."
Said Nephi

"Well now."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano quickly finishes his meal.

Cassie-May O'Brien looked at the waitress.

"We're gunna be payin'!"
Said Cassie-May

"...That's two and a half from me, plus beers."
Said Alexander

"I'll just put down two."
Said Nephi

"...Real expensive, out this way."

Missus Waiter stops making eyes at Gustav and heads back on over to the table.

"All together or separate?"
Said Missus

"Separate."
Said Cassie-May

"Gentlemen always pay for the-"
Said Nephi

"...Unless yer willin' ta pay fer meh."
Said Cassie-May

"Ain' gunna say no/"

"I got cash on hand. Not a problem."
Said Nephi

"... Never was good with money."
Said Alexander

"I'm up for it."

"Welp, he's payin' fer meh!"
Said Cassie-May

"Right."
Said Missus

"What a gentleman."

"Ah know, right?"
Said Cassie-May

"You take both sides cash here?"
Said Nephi

"Yes, sweetie."
Said Missus

"...Cash as opposed to what?"
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano puts down two dollars, Union.

Alexander Hauswald puts five dollars down.

j e s u sRockett Rimbjob:

He ordered a bunch of fancy shit m8.Missus Waiter:

"...How much did you EAT?"
Said Nephi

He got the steak in a bun and a rare steak on the side.Missus Waiter:

Alexander Hauswald points at the rare steak.

"That's for Sacks."
Said Alexander

Along with the booze.Missus Waiter:

And Cassie's lunch.Alexander Hauswald:

"Oh."
Said Nephi

Five bucks is probably enough to pay for EVERYBODY at the table, plus beers.

Missus Waiter collects the money and tucks it into her apron pocket.

"Change?"
Said Missus

"How much?"
Said Alexander

"I'm asking if you want it."
Said Missus

"Oh."
Said Alexander

"Yes please."

Missus Waiter digs around in her front pocket and lays down a half dollar and a quarter.

I presume everyone walks out after this?Missus Waiter:

Yeah.Alexander Hauswald:

It's super late for me.

Dice are not necessary.Rockett Rimbjob:

TFN taught me that.

Mainly because you want to avoid rolling dice as often as possible in TFNNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Because every time you do TFN luck happens

What with the imagery shown so far and the general feel.

This seems to hit.

Crystal Saint Claire is asleep in the chair

I am a moisten

It has been a troubling few days for Whitney. The sickness that came on a few days

after she arrived kept her in her room above at the saloon. Crystal kept an eye on her, though she insisted on

wearing a gas mask. The illness passed a day after it arrived and Whitney is feeling her oats again. She heads

over to the Marshalry offices to talk to the man that summoned her.

Wily Galen pokes his head up over his desk to look at the new arrival.

"Hey, Emilia."
Said Wily

"What is it Ga-"
Said Secretary

Secretary shoves her chair back from her desk and strides over to Whitney.

Whitney G. Elieen moves forward,one heavy step at a time. Feeling refreshed after so long spent in

"Hello. God bless you this fine morning...I am here to answer my summons."
Said Whitney

"Hello, you must be Miss Whitney."
Said Secretary

Secretary clears her throat.

"The Overmarshal is waiting for you."
Said Secretary

Whitney G. Elieen smiles

"Right this way."
Said Secretary

"Perfect. I shall follow your lead."
Said Whitney

Secretary walks up to the desk at the back of the office where a dark skinned, black haired man sits with

his boots up on his desk and his hat over his eyes.

Secretary smiles at Whitney as slams her hand down on the desk.

Overmarshal Fossifer jumps, then lifts his hat with a slow hand.

Whitney G. Elieen tilts her head but smiles all the same

"Sorry, had lunch not too long ago."
Said Overmarshal

"Hello Overmarshal Fossifer."
Said Whitney

Overmarshal Fossifer takes his boots off the desk and rearranges himself to appear more professional.

"I take it you are Miss Whitney?"
Said Overmarshal

"Yes. That is I. Whitney Gould Elieen."
Said Whitney

"And I'm Mister Fossifer."
Said Overmarshal

"God Bless, Mr.Fossifer...I am here to answer your summons."
Said Whitney

"I am sorry I did not get to meet sooner. I came ill of disease. Normally God has blessed me with good health, but

this time I feel I was to be tested."

Overmarshal Fossifer holds his hand up for a moment as if to speak, but ends the movement holding his

"I see."
Said Overmarshal

"I called you, and your companions, here, because I am in need of a miracle."

"My marshals have been dying by the dozen."

"I do not know an exact reason why."

"But I need help."

"Help from people who want to do good work."

"People no concerned with money, or power of a badge."
Said Overmarshal

"I see. How blessed you are that I work for the ultimate miracle maker." She says with a

smile. "I have been led here I believe for a reason. To save as many as I can and to show them that the Lord I

serve has not ignored their prayers."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"I have no interest in the badge and have no need for mortal trappings beyond what is necessary to do his work. "

"I need only direction."

Overmarshal Fossifer grunts as he drags a hand across the lines of his face.

"Don't agree about Lord business, but agree that people need to be saved."
Said Overmarshal

"Told your friends about losing Billy's old caselog."

"Figured he might be alive enough to worry about."

"Met up with Rockett and she put them on the scent of Doc Mitchell."

"Part of deal about Mysterious gunslinger shot Jones two months back."

"Knew it was real bad when Mitchell up and ran."
Said Overmarshal

"Not too brave, but don't know him to abandon patient."

"That is the beautiful thing about him, Overmarshal. He believes in you even if you do not

believe in him. But as for Mitchel...odd that a doctor would abandon his oath to his patient."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"This Rockett is a friend of yours?"

"Marshal, most of time."
Said Overmarshal

"Also happens to..."

"Work at brothel, sometimes."

"Good woman."

"Many good women end up in unclean professions unfortunately...Not that God loves them

any less."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Like spies in Canaan."
Said Overmarshal

"Whores alright, long as they don't corrupt decent folk."

"Never understand any religion."

"They do as they do for they feel there is no other choice...or they do not know a better way.

My task here on this earth is to show them the better way."

Whitney G. Elieen:

Whitney G. Elieen smiles

"I would like to pay a visit to her if i can. For reasons spiritual and mundane."
Said Whitney

"She knows our direction after all."

Overmarshal Fossifer squints at something he can only see for a moment, before turning to the red haired

woman in the green dress.

"I can probably find her at the hotel if need be."
Said Secretary

"And you, being so capable, can do without me for a little while."

Overmarshal Fossifer gives a solemn nod to the Secretary's words.

"Anything else you need Miss Whitney?"
Said Overmarshal

"Nothing further at this time."
Said Whitney

"I don't have anything else for you."
Said Overmarshal

"Just remember that I am here."

"Maybe your Lord need me to help you for Him sometime."

"Perhaps he does. As I follow her path it will become clear either way. Wherever the path

takes me I shall follow."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"God bless you Overmarshal."

"..."
Said Overmarshal

"Never heard anyone consider that before."

"Yes. Her path. It would be folly to think of God in the limited binary of us, the created. He is

beyond our understanding but for his power and splendor and her mercy and love."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Such is the word of God herself."

Overmarshal Fossifer says nothing as he scratches the scruff of his chin. His eyes stay on Whitney.

"Wise words, wiser than I've heard in long time."
Said Overmarshal

"Glad to have you Miss Whitney."

"I have had a wise teacher."
Said She

"All mine, Miss Whitney."
Said Overmarshal

Overmarshal Fossifer tips his hat to her.

"All mine."
Said Overmarshal

Secretary walks forward and takes Whitney's arm, as best she can. It is similar to a child trying to put his

hand around an entire cow.

"I'll accompany you to the hotel Miss Whitney."
Said Secretary

"Can't have the faithful losing their way."

"Thank you, sister. Let us make our way."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen starts her trek out of the building. Walking slowly so the secretary could keep up with

her tall stride.

The Secretary leads Whitney across town. She seems a little intimidated by Whitney's

size at first, but spreads a grin across her face and attempt conversation despite.

"So, would you like to discuss..."
Said Secretary

"It was, the most salient information."

"I'm sure there's more to you than that."

"Not to say that it isn't good to show yourself, righteous and all that."
Said Secretary

"Am babbling."

"No. No you are fine. Though I would like to discuss faith. If you are so inclined." She says

with a warm smile, looking down at the much smaller woman.

Whitney G. Elieen:

"I am always happy to discuss my faith with the curious."

"I am curious."
Said Secretary

"Some say it's my vice."

"Sticking my nose where some don't like noses stuck."

"A dangerous trait. But a righteous one. God loves those who love to know. Though if the

story of Eden is any indication it does not come without its grave dangers."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"There is also a strong danger in not knowing. Ignorance of the greater truth has doomed humanity since before

and beyond the era of Christ."

"I suppose there are some things I'd rather not know, but I only knew that after I'd learned them."
Said Secretary

"But knowing more has helped us all a great deal."

"And once knowledge begins it perpetuates itself, to some extent."

"Like a stone rolling down a hill."

"Right. And as it rolls down the hill our control of it, for better or worse, is done. All we can do

now is to react to the stone. We can either use what we know and step out of the way or be ignorant of it and be

rolled over."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"...that's a direction I hadn't considered for that simile."
Said Secretary

"The knowledge in and of itself is neither good nor evil. How we respond to this knowledge,

Whitney G. Elieen:

"I can agree to that."
Said Secretary

"Nobel invented dynamite for construction and excavation."

"Not as a tool of war."

"It depends a lot on the knowledge I suppose. Some is hard to grasp. Some is beyond our

comprehension as mortal beings...and some brings sublime comfort."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Or so it should."

"The bible is a great tool...but a dangerous one in the hands of those who do not understand it."

"Or refuse to."

"Like dynamite"

"Indeed, Copernicus comes to mind."
Said Secretary

"The bible has nothing to say on heliocentric or geocentric theory, but the papacy assumed the knowledge of the

day to be part of God's truth and would hear nothing to contradict their geocentric view."

"I know little of the sciences...but I do know a great deal of the folly of mortal churches. The

papacy in particular. A decadent institution more concerned with dogma and ritual than truth...and yet through

them God can work wonders."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Yet it saddens me...and saddens her for that matter that her message of love can be warped and twisted so."

Secretary nods her head with evident enthusiasm.

"Yes, it is so frustrating when people refuse to understand."
Said Secretary

"They don't look at what you're showing them."

"They're looking at something inside their own heads."

"They are not concerned with her truth...but their truth. The truth that is most comforting to

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Jesus fought hard against this when he was here on this earth."

"Not many know but he was quite the rebel."

"Spreading the message of the Lord and her truth of love, despite what the Pharisees taught."

"The pharisees being, at the time, among the highest of their religious order. These were Godly men. Or so it was

"People do often say they are one thing while they are something entirely different."
Said Secretary

"One can have the faith to move mountains...the gift of prophecy, command of the kingdoms

of man and beyond and yet if they have not love in their hearts..."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"They are nothing."

"Today it is more than just the Pharsiee we must look out for...the forces of evil have become bold."

"They know their time is coming to a close. So they seek to turn as many away from God's love as they can."

"I suppose."
Said Secretary

"From what I've seen, there are more concerned with damning the mortal body to a wormy pit than slaying souls."

"And it is in this wormy pit that they learn to despair. The forces of evil are blunt. Jesus

himself paid the ultimate price because of it."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"And yet he overcame all the same."

"Indeed he did."
Said Secretary

Secretary twiddles her finger as the Kansas City hotel comes into view.

"I'm going to be honest and say that I have no idea what to say next."
Said Secretary

"Miss Rockett should not be hard to find."

"Remember this. God loves you. I shall keep you in my prayers. Knowledge can be comfort

as well...take comfort that she is watching over you."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Thank you kindly for taking me here."

"Oh, no problem at all."
Said Emilia

"If you need any help finding Miss Rockett, talk to the waiters."

"The thin one is Einhart, the lady who looks like she wants to be somewhere else is Jan, the fat one is Gustav, and

the cook with the odd hair is Duret."

"Thank you so much."
Said She

"I am sure the waiters will guide my way from here."

"Right, be safe Miss Whitney."
Said Emilia

Emilia turns and walks off to the marshalry offices.

(That should be good until tomorrow, or when we can get Scotty.)Emilia:

Rockett Rimjob takes another gulp from her beer, then looks at the bottle's label for a moment.

"...how many's that? Three? Ah oughta keep tabs on mah tab 'fore Ah head outta here..."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien seemed to be chasing beer with coffee and vice versa, one beverage per hand.

down like a..."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Cassie-May O'Brien paused.0000000000000

"...Like a... Tarnation, Ah got a colorful comparision there but Ah lost it.'Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Ain't had much ta eat t'day. Means Ah want more. An' it makes 'em kick a little harder'n they

usually do."

Rockett Rimjob:

Rockett Rimjob sighs, swirling her beer around in the bottle she holds. "It'll be good ta head back ta

Dodge though. Ain't been there fer a time."

"Y'ever been?"
Said Rockett

"Ta Dodge? Eeeyup, once. Jus' in passin', though. Didn' see much a' it."
Said Cassie-May

"Not a bad place. Ain't too big, but it's got its charm. Few caravaners an' workers with some

stuffy wallets Ah'm familiar with."

Rockett Rimjob:

"Usually spend a spell there on mah way west an' east."

"They got a nice bar. Real nice. Place ya'd never expect ta find in a place like Dodge."

"Ah thought Dodge's made solely outta places y'all don't expect ta find in Dodge."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien took a gulp of beer.

"...'bout sums it up, honestly."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien grinned.

"Y'all been travellin' a lot?"
Said Cassie-May

"Oh, you bet."
Said Rockett

"Moment Ah left home Ah kept walkin' with these boots of mahne 'til Ah found a coast."

"Then Ah turned around an' kept walkin' again. 'Til Ah got bored of that -- then Ah started walkin' south 'til Ah hit

tha Rio Grande, an' north 'til Ah got too cold."

"Don't usually cross tha Mississippi no more, though. Ah tend ta like it out here."

"Ah'm pretty cimilar, sugercube. Jus' Ah got enough of a brains ta git mahself a horse when

Ah could."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Cassie-May O'Brien sipped coffee.

Rockett Rimjob gives Cassie a look.

"Smartass."
Said Rockett

"All tha' walkin' done good fer yer calves though."
Said Cassie-May

"Thank you, thank you~!"
Said Rockett

"Gotta put sum' honey on all tha' smartass stingin', don't Ah?"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien snickered.

"Smartasses keep tha world interestin'. Or they make it tough."
Said Rockett

"Usually tha first one."

Rockett Rimjob finishes off her bottle and sets it down with a thud.

"Which un' am Ah so far?"
Said Cassie-May

"Well, ya ain't been dumb enough ta pull a gun on me yet."
Said Rockett

"Ah'd say yer doin' good on me."

"Ye wuzn' dumb enough ta giv' meh a reason ta pull a gun on yew, so... Guess we're gunna

be thick as thieves, goin' like this."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"...This reminds meh. Ah always fergit to do tha'."

Cassie-May O'Brien grumbled to herself, finished her beer, and pulled out the double-barrelled shotgun on

the table before her.

Rockett Rimjob looks at it.

"...not bad."
Said Rockett

"Little hefty fer mah tastes, though."

"Mnn."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien broke it open and fished out the two shells.

"Plan B here saved mah sorry arse a few tahmes, hefty as it is."
Said Cassie-May

"Better'n no gun, that's fer sure."
Said Rockett

"Pretty good-lookin', too, even though it ain't mah style."

Cassie-May O'Brien checked the barrells and put in two different-colored shells. Slugs.

"Ah usually am fahne wit' mah Winchester. This here's mostleh fer them oh-shit scenarios,

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Cassie-May O'Brien - come to think of it - has an absurd amount of weapons on her. This shotgun, the

Winchester rifle secure in the sling, a Colt Navy on her hip, a saber on other hip, a Bowie knife, another

two knives...

"...luggin' around all that iron oughta be a real pain."
Said Rockett

"Mah back's killin' meh."
Said Cassie-May

"That's why Ah got an all-purpose fucker-upper on mah thigh."
Said Rockett

"Eeeyup, but it got only two shots innit."
Said Cassie-May

"Most situations don't need more than one. Tha rest? Heaven ferbid, Ah might spend a whole

quarter second jammin' two more in there."

Rockett Rimjob:

"...Mmn. Hope y'all never git in a situation yew realize luggin' a loaded spare iron's faster

than reloadin' when a huge fuckin' mass o' muscle an' fur's chargin' at y-"

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Cassie-May O'Brien stopped herself.

"Eh, um, righ'. Think Ah'm gunna need anuther beer."
Said Cassie-May

"Ah got another one'a these. Somewhere."
Said Rockett

"Think Ah left it in mah shack in Salt Lake City."

"...don't go there too often. Mormons usually don't take too kind ta me."

Rockett Rimjob chuckles, at that.

"Dunnaw, yew dun' smite lil' Nephi there like an archangel woulda."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien put the shotgun away and motioned at the waitress to get her another beer.

"Ah'll hav'ta catch up with Pastor Creely. If he's even Pastor anymore."
Said Rockett

"That's a fun story."

"Y'all wanna tell it?"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien grinned.

"You ever seen an entire town get turned upside down by a pretty little thang in cowboy boots

an' a shoulder-slip?"

Rockett Rimjob:

"Eeeenope?"
Said Cassie-May

"Well. Little place called Castle Rock. Tiny town, not more'n a hunnerd people, or so. Real cute,

simple. Not far from Salt Lake."

Rockett Rimjob:

"Ah stroll in there on mah way east. Don't got no waterin' hole, since it's an awfully devout place, so Ah head to

tha barber's. Figger Ah might as well trim up."

"Have a nice conversation with a well-dressed gennleman as he's gettin' 'is 'stache all nice an' pretty. Push came

ta shove, he enned up payin' me a king's ransom an' pullin' me ta his home."

ev'ry corner, with such a tiny community. Ah was used ta it. Don't mind tha attention, neither."

"What Ah didn't know was that Ah jus' bagged tha Pastor."

"Tha married pastor with kids who was also tha effective mayor an' de facto sheriff."

"Th' whole package, huh?"
Said Cassie-May

"Oh you bet."
Said Rockett

"You could guess 'bout how happy tha whole town was when word got 'round. Didn't take long for ev'ry set 'f ears

ta hear bout Creely an' 'is adventures while his wife was in Salt Lake."

"Ah snuck out tha back window when tha mob came ta his front door."

"Serves him righ' fer thinkin' wit' his pecker!"
Said Cassie-May

"Guess it does. Felt kinda sorry. If Ah'da known who he was, even Ah woulda told 'em ta

reconsider. But Ah'd only rolled inta town that afternoon."

Rockett Rimjob:

"Found out later that he was kicked outta town. Not sure what happened ta Castle Rock since then, but Ah think

they're unner new management."

"Might stop by with a duster an' some overalls one day, jus' ta see."

"Y'all got meh curious. Ah wanna see tha'!"
Said Cassie-May

"Well. Ain't too sure if we're headed that way, but if we do..."
Said Rockett

"...Then it woulda be a nice sidetrack ta git distracted by."
Said Cassie-May

"...maybe do it again. Fer kicks."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien snorted into her coffee.

"Yer incorrigible."
Said Cassie-May

"'S mah middle name."
Said Rockett

"Papa tried fixin' me. An' Ah tried bein' reasonable."

"Didn' werk out?"
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimjob leans back, and kicks her ruby red kickers onto the table.

"Didn't take to it, naw."
Said Rockett

"Well, s- ooh. There's Whitney. Oi! Whitney!"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien waved to the newcomer.

"..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen walks slowly towards the two, each step falling heavy on the wood flooring

Rockett Rimjob smiles, thinking about the conversation she just had, and then turns to face this Whitney

Rockett Rimjob 's face immediately deflates.

"Howdy, sugercube."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien blinks.

Cassie-May O'Brien blink blinks.

Rockett Rimjob is leaning back, in her scanty dress, red boots on the table, smelling of alcohol, tobacco,

and sex.

"Hello Cassie..."
Said Whitney

Cassie-May O'Brien looks between the two.

"And hello to you Judy."
Said Whitney

"..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob stands up.

"It has been a long while...but I could never forget that face of yours."
Said Whitney

"How tha hell'd you find me? And--And don't call me Judy," she barks. Her happy demeanor she

held a moment before is all but gone, replaced with some sort of long-seething anger.

Rockett Rimjob:

"I did not find you."
Said Whitney

".....Sssssso Ah guess yew two know each other already."
Said Cassie-May

"I did not seek you, though you have been in my prayers for a very long time."
Said Whitney

Rockett Rimjob turns to Cassie.

Cassie-May O'Brien looks confused and alert.

Rockett Rimjob chops at her neck with one of her hands. Seems she wants Cass to clam it.

"I ask God every other night where you might be...her response is always the same."
Said Whitney

Cassie-May O'Brien blinks.

Rockett Rimjob turns back to look at Whitney.

Cassie-May O'Brien slooowly brings the coffee mug to her lips and takes a sip, watching the scene.

"Ah wish Ah got popcorn."
Said (From

"Right. Lettin' God solve all yer problems. Uh-huh."
Said Rockett

"You better not be here ta goad me inta headin' home. Ain't happenin'."

"Aiiiin't happenin'."

"She is the supreme problem solver."
Said Whitney

Rockett Rimjob wags a finger.

"And no. Not at all."
Said Whitney

"There is no home to go back to but the one up in heaven."

Rockett Rimjob rolls her eyes.

"They are gone."
Said Whitney

"Ah heard."
Said Rockett

"Mother and father. Ascended. I have seen it with my own eyes. I did not see you however."
Said Whitney

"I knew you were out here somewhere...I have tried to find you. The last time we spoke..."

Rockett Rimjob bites one of her cheeks.

Whitney G. Elieen lifts her hair up a bit, so as to show a rather nasty scar.

"You did this."
Said Whitney

"..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob grits her teeth.

Cassie-May O'Brien put the mug back on the table with a clunk louder than intended.

"Ain't a mite close ta what Ah came ta you with."
Said Rockett

Whitney G. Elieen sets the hair down

"An' if ya woulda cut tha googly Adventist hoo-hah fer five seconds Ah'd still be able ta read a

damn book."

Rockett Rimjob:

"Fuckin' bitch."

"Your anger is understandable."
Said Whitney

Rockett Rimjob spits onto Whitney's shoes, then she starts angrily digging into her pocket.

"Father did so many terrible things...misguided. Born of love but expressed in such a terrible

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Born o' love mah sorry ass."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob slaps a bill down on the table and flicks it over to the discarded beer bottles.

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimjob looks at Cass.

"She ain't fuckin' with you, is she?"
Said Rockett

"You marshals?"

"...Now, simmer down a bit, y'all."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien held her hands up.

"Ah got no idea y'all know each other up to now so don'cha unload whutever is between

yew two on meh."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Whitney G. Elieen looks on in silence

"She is right you know"
Said Whitney

"Do not burden strangers with asylum. I am right here...and now that I have found you I am not going anywhere."

Cassie-May O'Brien swung her legs over the seat and stood up.

"Ta hell you ain't. Ah ain't gonna spend five more seconds around you."
Said Rockett

"Ah'll simmer down when Ah'm six feet under."

"You can't run from me forever Judy..."
Said Whitney

Rockett Rimjob pulls a cigar from her satchel, as well as a match, and proceeds to try and light the damn

thing up with desperation and anger.

"Don't fuckin' call me that!"
Said Rockett

"An' you don't breathe a word of this!" she says, giving Cass a rather rude pointing-to before hurrying her way to

the stairs.

"...uh...?"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien scratched her neck in confusion.

Rockett Rimjob puff puff puff

"..."
Said Whitney

"I am sorry you had to hear this."

Rockett Rimjob puffs FURIOUSLY

Rockett Rimjob closes the door behind her after a giant puff of smoke

"God bless you child, you could not have foreseen this reunion."
Said Whitney

Cassie-May O'Brien turns to Whitney.

"Whut the fuck did Ah jus' witness."
Said Cassie-May

"Yer sisters?"

"Yes"
Said Whitney

"We are."

"Judy Elieen. Daughter of James and Bethany Elieen."

"She goes by another name now it seems."

"...Fits 'er better, truth be told."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien retrieved her coffee mug.

(lmao)Rockett Rimjob:

"...So, lemme guess an' correct me if Ah'm wrong here."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien took a sip.

"Yer sisters."
Said Cassie-May

"Yes this is true."
Said Whitney

"Yer wuz yer dad's favourite while Rockett 'ere wuz at odds wit' him."
Said Cassie-May

"Dad beat me all the same. But less so. At the time faith, to me, was a way to live in peace."
Said Whitney

"So, yew ran ta God while she ran away."
Said Cassie-May

"After throwing a rock at my head"
Said Whitney

"And sending me into a two week long coma"

"Ah wuz' meanin' ta ask fer th' scar."
Said Cassie-May

"Why'd she throw tha' rock? Wait... Yew tried ta stop her?"

"Or defend yer father?"

"She came to me, crying...asking for support. I was flawed. Callous even. It was not that I did

not care but I was...unsure of how to help her."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Tha' explains how angry she wuz."
Said Cassie-May

"I tried to tell her how I get by. But I said it in a way that only pushed her away."
Said Whitney

"Mmm. Mighta wanted ta open wit' tha' instead of tellin' how God crossed yer paths. Mahbe

followed by "Ah'm sawrry Ah failed yew as a sister" or sumthin'..."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Cassie-May O'Brien sipped her coffee, then realized that her mug is dry with a groan.

"But God did cross our paths."
Said Whitney

"She said so herself."

"She doesn' really seem ta care too much 'bout displays of piety, sugercube."
Said Cassie-May

"Mother and father are in heaven. I know this because I have seen it myself."
Said Whitney

"When I awoke from my coma after receiving my commandment...they were gone. Vanished."

"...Whuh?"
Said Cassie-May

"I did not see my sister however. I have been told from the highest of authorities that she was

roaming the earth."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Lost and astray..."

"...Did yew see th' exact moment of yer parents flyin' up ta heaven in light an' glory?"
Said Cassie-May

"They were there when I arrived."
Said Whitney

"It seemed like an instant...I was not aware it had been two weeks."

"...Ssso yew did? Or didn't?"
Said Cassie-May

"I didn't, no. They seemed to be already there when I arrived."
Said Whitney

weeks later."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Yes...why do you suspect something?"
Said Whitney

"Time in heaven works differently than time here."

"In those two weeks...anything could happen. The beauty of God's grace is that it applies to

each and every one of us. It is our gift. Regardless of whether we deserve it. Forgiveness is ours if we so seek it."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Perhaps in those two weeks...he finally did."

"...So, Whitney, y'all seekin' Rockett's fergiveness, or th' other way 'round?"
Said Cassie-May

"It is especially hard for the pious to find salvation, believe it or not. The sick can only be

healed if they seek a doctor. I feel the experience of losing me and his other daughter may have set him on the

right path."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"I am seeking her own of course. She may have thrown a stone at me...but I hold no ill will towards that."

"I was wrong. Father was wrong. I want to try and make it right."

"...Welp. Y'all stay here an' think on yer phrasing, then, an' Ah'm gunna go talk ta her."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien patted Whitney's arm, smiled and turned to the stairs.

"..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen goes over to the table, kneels down and prays...

Cassie-May O'Brien stares

"..."
Said Cassie-May

"...Eeeeeyup. Y'all wanna keep them displays o' piety ta minimum, sugercube. Preferableh sittin' instead of

Cassie-May O'Brien turned to the stairs again and went to find the door Rockett disappeared behind.

The door to her room is wide open.Rockett Rimjob:

"Rockett? Y'all 'ere? 'S me, Cassie!"
Said Cassie-May

She is not in her room, howeverRockett Rimjob:

Whitney G. Elieen does not respond. Rather she keeps her eyes closed tight in silent prayer...

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien peers into Rockett's room. Any open windows, signs of quick packing?

Nope. Stuff's just as it would be.Rockett Rimjob:

You do however hear some creaking floorboards just down the hall.

Cassie-May O'Brien turns to look

As well as some muffled moaning.Rockett Rimjob:

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien walked over to the source of the sounds.

A locked door to one of the rooms.Rockett Rimjob:

What do you think is happening?

Cassie-May O'Brien presses her ear to the door.

"...Mmmeeeeyup."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien pulls back and puts her hands on her hips.

"..."
Said Cassie-May

"...Nnnh... Nnh, damn you got good aim..."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien turned on her heel, blushing faintly, and marched back down to the main hall.

"...Ah think 's best y'all give 'er a minute. She appears ta be fuckin'."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien sat down heavily.

"...AhCassie-May O'Brien:

am too sober fer this."

Whitney G. Elieen opens her eyes

"I see. She is trying to blow off steam...perhaps make me angry."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen unclasps her hands and starts to get up onto her feet.

"Ah think it mighta also be givin' herself tahme an' space away from yew, since it ain' like

we're gunna barge in on her doin' them bedsheet tango."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"I will not intrude upon her den."
Said Whitney

("the more the merrier")Rockett Rimjob:

"Perhaps she will calm down enough to talk with me then."
Said Whitney

"It has been a long time...and I have missed her. She is the only family I have left on this earth, after all."

walkin funny after whut

Cassie-May O'Brien:

is goin' on now."

Cassie-May O'Brien rubbed her neck again.

"Tha's an incredibly awkward situation."
Said Cassie-May

"I am sorry you had to be caught in the middle of it."
Said Whitney

"God's plan is mysterious...perhaps there was a good reason why I was not told where she was. I can only guess

at the divine."

"...Ah ain', actually. Looks like yew two gunna have a mighty need fer a pious ta fuck you

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"...a translator. That is a good word for it."
Said Whitney

"Through God the power of tongues are of little concern. But for me...?"

Whitney G. Elieen shakes her head

"When it comes to her it feels we are almost from completely different worlds."
Said Whitney

"...Weird how thut goes, huh..."
Said Cassie-May

"...I don't much care for it."
Said Whitney

"I want to set things right and atone for my failure."

"I want her to join me in heaven."

"...Heaven. Righ'."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien rubbed the mark on her hand.

"...if only she had seen what I have seen..."
Said Whitney

"Whut did y'all see?"
Said Cassie-May

"They say the streets of heaven are paved in Gold...I tell you this. Those are the most

mundane of it's wonders."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"So yer sayin' yew saw Heaven while in coma?"
Said Cassie-May

"To even begin to describe it feels almost impossible...paradise. Beyond all imagining. The

Whitney G. Elieen:

"...Huh. Neat."
Said Cassie-May

"Yes...very neat."
Said Whitney

"...God will be coming soon."

Cassie-May O'Brien turned her head to the stairs.

"The end times are coming. I want to save as many as I can...each and every soul I save

means the world to me. But my sister..."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Ah'm pretty sure tha' ain' God in there wit' Rockett, but y'all mighta be right 'bout that."
Said Cassie-May

"...Oh. Yew meant like the Rapture."

"Yes. The second coming of Christ."
Said Whitney

"She is coming for her children."

"Wuzn' Jesus a man?"
Said Cassie-May

"To set the evil of the world right and to make us whole again. So it says in the bible and so it

was said to me."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"God the son? Yes."

"God the father is far more incomprehensable however."

"Even more so as God the son and God the father are one and the same."

"It is easy for us to think of God through the limited human lens. She is far more then we could ever hope to

imagine. I should know...I did see her. A glimpse at least."

"In the blinding light of heaven."

crazy patootee from brain trauma. But Ah saw yew heal wounds wit' yer touch."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"...yes. I am well aware of how I sound."
Said Whitney

"How unbelievable it is."

"But I have seen it myself...and I have seen the wonders God is capable of."

(I'M ALIVE)

"Again...Ah saw yew heal wounds wit' a touch."
Said Cassie-May

"...siddawn wit' meh. Ah'll git us somethin' ta drink."

"Thank you..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen says as she moves to sit

"A water for me please."
Said Whitney

I finally get to use all this gosh dang gospel music I got.(To Yuppie b.):

"Ah'm gunna need a water fer mah friend an'... six more beers."

Yes.

also I accidentally deleted rocket

...

so if you put the cards down I still can't see themRockett Rimjob:

doc please

I can't see

Like, can't see anything?

nopRockett Rimjob:

screen is blaq

I fix.

i am like these tunes(From Whitney G. Elieen):

I thought you might.(To Yuppie b.):

Behold.

How OP Rockett is.

Three aces.Cassie-May O'Brien:

Three face cards.

Hoy shit.

Yeh brub.

Sorry, I need to get this figured out.

Whitney G. Elieen:

This was

if not dramatic!

So that 4d12 is going to mein, 1d12 to Deft, and I'm thinking the 3d12 to strengthRockett Rimjob:

how does this

lookRockett Rimjob:

why so much Strength?Cassie-May O'Brien:

Pretty gud.

How else is she going to hold those tits up Varmus?

jokes aside, Strength is basically only used for melee damage.Cassie-May O'Brien:

Probably a good thing to consider, because she's going to be an up close fighter,

when she does fight.

Unless you plan to bitchslap people left and right, it's somewhat wasted.Cassie-May O'Brien:

ohhCassie-May O'Brien:

she's a deceptively butch bitchRockett Rimjob:

Her special gun does have a downside.

like her sisterCassie-May O'Brien:

If you do not brace for impact.

You can break your wrist.

there's one more thingCassie-May O'Brien:

Yep.

You can't tell me the blonde sisters don't deserve a reward Fate Chip for this.Cassie-May O'Brien:

They'll get their Fate chips when I get everything situated.

aye aye!Cassie-May O'Brien:

Rockett Rimjob:

I'd like some help yesRockett Rimjob:

"...don't stop"
Said Cassie-May

so VigorRockett Rimjob:

what's the deal with taking damage and having to succeed a roll or somethign

actual damage to your body parts, and Wind

Damage to body parts (arms, legs, guts, head) goes on a 1 to 5 scale.

It is the serious bad bad thing.

That is actually a very apt way to put it

"but whitney's just a fatty"
Said Rockett

it's equal to your Spirit and Vigor dice combined

plus extras

I seeRockett Rimjob:

as in number of dice or dice type

Dice type

o okRockett Rimjob:

so 16 is ok?

it's not that important actually

o okRockett Rimjob:

also it'd be great to have Nev here becaus he knows this system inside out

generally when you take actual damage, you compare it to the Size of your character

for every full increment, you get 1 point of wound

there are perks to make you bigger or smaller

smaller is bad because it's easier to hurt you

as a frontliner you might consider taking the same perk Whitney has

but that will come later

i like it how that's a term nowRockett Rimjob:

yeRockett Rimjob:

so are perks the only thing that affect size

another thing is armor

armor is either light or heavy

Cass got some light armor on her legs

light armor reduces amount of rolled damage you take

heavy armor reduces the amount of dice and their size

I seeRockett Rimjob:

how is punch damage determineRockett Rimjob:

Fists are just straight Strength roll.

...Rockett Rimjob:

I amWhitney G. Elieen:

not fat!

Rockett Rimjob:

Rockett Rimjob punches whitney

so if you roll max on a dice, you roll again and add that to the roll

Rockett Rimjob:

I seeRockett Rimjob:

yeRockett Rimjob:

how much damageWhitney G. Elieen:

would that punch do to witty00000000000000

You better.

I got my dice set up yesRockett Rimjob:

skill points

ActuallyWhitney G. Elieen:

Witty's size counts as

How much damage is 3

serious but not utterly debilitating

combine your dice sizes for Knowledge, Smarts and Cognition

that will give you your skill points to spend

already spentRockett Rimjob:

nothing is bigger than 5?

yesRockett Rimjob:

Concentrations picked, too?

what're thoseRockett Rimjob:

some skills got a concentration you have to pick

like Fightin'

It's not straight Fightin', but Fightin' (something)

in your case probably Fightin' (Brawlin'_

o okRockett Rimjob:

The fact you have a Fightin' (Brawlin') 5 doesn't mean you know how to use a saber effectively

for an example

rightoRockett Rimjob:

spend 3 more and you now also have, say, Fightin' (Sabre) 5

so go check over if you got all those picked and ready

I am

Mobile present.

I heard someone ask for me.

What can Nev do for you

I can go over Wind, Size, and wounds and what they m3an for you.

I think I got that down varmRockett Rimjob:

what next

Nev I need some succ.

Grit is 0

you need to earn that

You need to earn.

TRUE GRIT.

do you mean gutsRockett Rimjob:

o nevermind

Nope.

Grit is different.

okay how do we get these thenRockett Rimjob:

You both want and don't want it.

Each point of grit is worth a +1

Get enough and bad dudes are gonna come looking for you.

okay got thoseRockett Rimjob:

now for

how many can I haveRockett Rimjob:

because I have a goddamn laundry list

you can get up to 10 points worth from them

o okRockett Rimjob:

Ye, that's the upper limit.

You can take more if you want.

That's if you want to.

I am a kind Lord.

pick out your Hindrances

and then we'll spend those hard-earned points on Edges

rockett is a sinful soul

This Rockett is going to planet sin.

I am going to invest in every possible thing that aids persuasion rollsRockett Rimjob:

Sounds accurate.

Maybe if you knew the difference between letters and numbers you would.

does my left fist count as my off handRockett Rimjob:

I think it doesRockett Rimjob:

Doc's call, but personally, if I was the GM, I'd say that unarmed attacks utilize whatever part of the

body is convenient at the time and are not chained like this - but it would help if you, say, wanted to put an

unarmed attack on top of a weapon attack.

Doc what's your callRockett Rimjob:

double-fisting my opponents or no

How about a different Edge called Jockey that increases unarmed damage by 20%

with each rank?

Up to one hundred percent at the fifth level.

yes pleaseRockett Rimjob:

regardng melee damage

tje Strength roll is a (keep highest)

Okay then.

Oh so noRockett Rimjob:

with that in mind does it change your answer docRockett Rimjob:

Change what?

Yarp.

yesRockett Rimjob:

I didn't see Jockey in the book so

I thought it was custom

It is.

I just made it up.

well regardless I'll still take itRockett Rimjob:

Righto.

Add it to your sheet.

DoneRockett Rimjob:

now equipment

you get $250 and clothes on your back

no idea how that wild crazy gun of yours is gonna be ruled as

Give a tick.

Rockett Rimjob dumps a bowl of tics on Doc

it's 3 AM here so I thnk I'm gonna conk out here

it was fun

Take off forty bucks from your sheet for the pocket Rockett.

Pocket rockettWhitney G. Elieen:

Rockett in the Pockett.

The first guy in sight that didn't look like a corpse or a sadist.Rockett Rimjob:

What's a quick draw holster do

Make it easier to draw.

any mechanical effectRockett Rimjob:

I have no idea.

bgvfegbrnhbgrtefegtbtgrWhitney G. Elieen:

Listen to this.

So how do I mark down buyingRockett Rimjob:

is it pistol or rifle ammo

Rifle, since you've got a sawn off rifle.

Also five bucks for a box of fifty.

rightoRockett Rimjob:

What did I miss.

Mostly nothing.

I played this.

A $7 can of liquid seems to have hopefully fixed the problem.

Have a listen and guess how I'm going to use the music.

You're going to dread it, soon.

DocRockett Rimjob:

Coc

GodWhitney G. Elieen:

I bought everything I could really think of but I still got 175 leftRockett Rimjob:

I think it good

Having leftovers is important m8.

yeah but that's a lot of leftoversRockett Rimjob:

You don't get paid every day, and it costs money to travel.

that's 70% leftoversRockett Rimjob:

leftovers can be good butWhitney G. Elieen:

lets see what else you can buy

It also costs money for room, board.

Medical services, should you need them.

Ah.Rockett Rimjob:

But you forget.

And a host of other things.

Rocket is a whore.Rockett Rimjob:

That is actually one of the most lucrative and important jobs in the West.

Who needs to pay for room and board and food and maybe medical services or a get-out-of-jail-

free card when you can just fuck someone and get them to buy it all for you?

Rockett Rimjob:

I think it might be sinful if Whitty has a ton of extra moneyWhitney G. Elieen:

Give it to Rockett so she can spend it on booze.

And nut butter.

"God? Should I give my sister money she is obviously going to spend on booze?"
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen looks up to the sky

A horse is $100

And a saddle is another 50

but whyRockett Rimjob:

would I buy a horse

when I can just fuck somebody

and bum a ride on their horse

"If you believe it a good way to make inroads to her salvation. Drink is sinful only in excess, and

her liver has become quite resistant to excess."

(To Yuppie b.):

But.

And I know this might sound crazy.

What if you fucked the horse instead?

save a horse, ride a horseRockett Rimjob:

"How do I reach her lord? She will not listen...she hates me and hates you by

extension. The sins of our father and myself have pushed her away."

(From Whitney G. Elieen):

would I have to make a Strength roll to take the horescockRockett Rimjob:

or would that be nimblenessRockett Rimjob:

Rockett Rimjob:

looks like I'm dead

Rockett's butt will never be the same.

Rockett Rimjob punches nev

How much would it beWhitney G. Elieen:

to try and healWhitney G. Elieen:

The Horsecock injuries with jesus

but do you see my pointRockett Rimjob:

why spend money

when you can be a whore

and not have to spend money

and then also make money

From Blazing Saddles.

If she isn't at that point already.

hey nev if I have pistol shootin 5 what would I roll for shooting anything other than pistolsRockett Rimjob:

You take that much penalty to all your rolls.

Witty has already been compared to the "Good" version of father Anderson from Hellsing

Whitney G. Elieen:

so 5d12 but -2 to each?Rockett Rimjob:

And pogo!Whitney G. Elieen:

She has skills that i think would compliment Rockett well

if they could get along

oh okayRockett Rimjob:

But she is a godless, angry whore and Witty is a religious loonWhitney G. Elieen:

Because of intense cheese by certain players, it is an official rule that you can NEVER substitute

Deftness for Shooting.

For instance, if an evil cultist throws some black magic at you that requires a Faith roll to resist, and you have no

Let it be known that in this game, where almost all dice are Keep Highest, penalties and bonuses are really, really

powerful and rare.

I seeRockett Rimjob:

they didRockett Rimjob:

read the logsRockett Rimjob:

really shouldRockett Rimjob:

and moreRockett Rimjob:

you see?Rockett Rimjob:

Oh dear.

That's startling.

whatWhitney G. Elieen:

do you think

yesRockett Rimjob:

what are your thoughts

Mighty interesting.

And I am

Mighty interested

To see what happens next.

One red and three whites.

Kay.

Groovy.

Since I got y'all here.

Varmus never finished going over Wind, Stun, and Wounds.

I can do that now if y'all would like.

To make it short.

Wind is effectively how tired you are. Every time you get shot, run too hard, or use certain abilities, you take Wind

Stun is what happens whenever you get shot hard enough to take a wound, and instead of shooting

Every time you take at least a light wound, you roll a Stun resist roll. Vigor roll against a TN of 5, plus 2 for each

wound level above Light, plus wound penalty.

And you keep losing all actions until you pass.

So get dunked on.

What's MORE.

Any damage. Of any kind.

If you take 1 point of damage you roll 1d6.

Plus 1d6 for every wound level you suffered.

What's more.

If you took a Serious or heavier wound, you suffer Bleeding.

And you keep taking it until you pass out.

And keep taking it after you pass out.

You can die from this.

To make a very, very long story short.

Get fukt don't get shot idiot

ohRockett Rimjob:

neb describe damage and how witty has likeWhitney G. Elieen:

an eighty percent chance of tanking a whole bullet

She can still be made to pass out from the sheer exertion it takes to block bullets with her washboard abs.

But it would take a while.

rocket is a cannon of glassRockett Rimjob:

whitney is

a brick

shithouseRockett Rimjob:

All humans, with some exceptions, have a size of 6.

humenRockett Rimjob:

All damage that doesn't deal a wound is ignored.

Whitney has a size of 8.

That's one point lower than the absolute theoretical maximum for humans

And the only way to get more is to be fat as fuck.

Is to be morbidly obese fat.

The only way to get more is to be Roadhog.

Whitney is as big as you can beWhitney G. Elieen:

without being

a fatty

Whitney reads the SWOLLY BIBLE.

what else modifies sizeRockett Rimjob:

While it is still recommended to be in cover, Whitney is more than capable of making charges and

NOTHING modifies Size.

except fatRockett Rimjob:

how does the armor add to thisWhitney G. Elieen:

The Fatty hindrance, the Brawny edge, and a certain ability only available to the Blessed, which

Whitney is.

ohRockett Rimjob:

Armor helps more. Armor reduces incoming damage's dye type, if it's normal armor.

Cover also does this.

Most cover is somewhere in the neighborhood of Armor 3.

How much protection does Whitney's armor give her now?Whitney G. Elieen:

Rockett Rimjob:

Rockett Rimjob:

so let's say I just shot whitney with a degenerRockett Rimjob:

and di

what happen

and let us assume the vest isWhitney G. Elieen:

Instead of rolling d10's, you would instead roll...

Rockett Rimjob:

guess I lose then

She takes 1d6 wind and is unharmed.

Whitney G. Elieen literally shrugs off an entire bullet

second shot that actually does not have 3 1sRockett Rimjob:

Whitney would take a single light wound to the chest.

Rockett Rimjob:

Is the foot.

You miss her armor.

and shoot herRockett Rimjob:

big meaty foot

so how bad would teh foot shot beWhitney G. Elieen:

The foot shot would nearly blow her foot off with three wounds.

that's a lotta damageRockett Rimjob:

Rockett Rimjob:

HAVE YOU HEARD A JESUS?

okay so if I rolled this shoot rollRockett Rimjob:

what would I do

what could I do

JESUS < FLEX-SEALWhitney G. Elieen:

Rockett Rimjob:

Standard shooting TN is 5, so you got two raises.

Which means that you now roll a d20

Rockett Rimjob:

fukRockett Rimjob:

I have no idea why the Hit Location d20 almost always seems to roll so low

Unless you're Nephi and somehow pull out a 30 on the to-hit and an 18 on the location.

Did I mention that Nephi rolled effectively a triple-crit on the first boss?

He did 70 damage.

The boss only survived because the GM cashed in every chip he had.0000000

So you rolled a 3. Presumably you want to move that up two points.

yeRockett Rimjob:

You want to hit the Gizzards or Noggin, because these give you bonus damage dice.

The Gizzards are at the 10, and the noggin is at the 20.

Gizzards for one bonus damage dice, Noggin for two.

Headshots also tend to be unarmored.

Which is why interrupt actions are important!

how are range penalties handledRockett Rimjob:

Badly.

Considering that pistols have a range of 10 yards...

You're really almost never going to run into a problem.

mine has 3Rockett Rimjob:

What do i have to roll again to punchWhitney G. Elieen:

so if I shoot at someone 5 yards awayRockett Rimjob:

I suffer a -2Rockett Rimjob:

what if i do notWhitney G. Elieen:

and if I shoot at someone 10 yards awayRockett Rimjob:

I suffer a -2

i have a fightin of 3Whitney G. Elieen:

Brawlin is clubs and fists.

You picked brawlin.

k soWhitney G. Elieen:

i roll

nev can you confirmRockett Rimjob:

I believe it's every range increment but I am not certain.

It never came up in a game.

Fights rarely took place at longer than 10yards of range.

Whitney G. Elieen:

No not like that.

You roll

Fightin number of Nimbleness dice type.

Whitney G. Elieen:

You might want to improve that, but yes that looks right.

You always, always, always reroll max number.

You can effectively crit on every single aspect of a thing.

what do you mean by max numbers?Whitney G. Elieen:

So on.

so i roll again?Whitney G. Elieen:

or roll a 1d6 in this case?

Make rolls like this.Nevermore:000

Whitney G. Elieen:

If you want to get even flashier, for Keep Highest rolls (Basically everything except damage) roll like

For instance.

Whitney G. Elieen:+0904

It kept the highest and rerolled all max dice.

k so i have...Whitney G. Elieen:

one red, white, and blue chip each

how many points

do i have and what

can i spend them on

Can i buy new miraclesWhitney G. Elieen:

oh and

Scotty wants to know if you can get edges laterWhitney G. Elieen:

You pay triple the point cost of the Edge.

And must give the GM a reason for your development.

Who can confirm or deny you at any time.

what about miracleWhitney G. Elieen:00000

can i buy

You can only buy miracle by increasing your Faith or Profession: Theology.

Increasing your Faith to 6 would cost 12 points.

how many pointWhitney G. Elieen:

do i have now

with red, white, and blue chipWhitney G. Elieen:

It caps out at 20.

But really when you're rolling 20d12 to do something.

With your america of chips

You have to decide whether to cash them in or not.

I know yes!Whitney G. Elieen:

How many points do have tho

So six points.

darnWhitney G. Elieen:

six more

for faith sixWhitney G. Elieen:

But you can have as many Experience Points as you like.

I am not sure if i wanna save up for more faith so i can do more jesus stuff orWhitney G. Elieen:

improve one of my stats

i think stats cuz i am okay with my jesus levels right nowWhitney G. Elieen:

I have to go for a while.

nevRockett Rimjob:

I want

a shotgunRockett Rimjob:

derringerRockett Rimjob:

Or buy a Lemat Grapeshot.

That has an underslung shotgun.

it must beRockett Rimjob:

I don't even know who crystal is lmaoRockett Rimjob:

Pogo's character.

In other words.

You might have a problem.

Considering OOC feelings.

yeah pointRockett Rimjob:

To use the-

To use the TFN comparison.

She does all the stuff Willow and the others would get up to.

If I wasn't so invested in Nephi, I would have played Humaized Willow myself.

Gotta go for a while.

Be back in 20.

Might go to bed soon after, dunno.

...Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire is asleep in a comfy chair

waitCrystal Saint Claire:

What do you mean OOC Feelings nev

I'm not about to drag beef from another campaign in here

And that's all I'll sayCrystal Saint Claire:

Anyways.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is slumped in the nearest available seating. For reasons currently unsaid, Nephi

has taken to checking in to make sure Crystal is able to rest/work undisturbed if need be.

Crystal Saint Claire has forgotten to eat twice now.

Am here, whatcha need

HmmCrystal Saint Claire:

I have...

more red chips than I can use

So I need to spend a few

How many did you have already?

oh. I had 3 beoreCrystal Saint Claire:

You can buy a three-point edge.

okCrystal Saint Claire:

...Crystal Saint Claire:

That means I spend 5 dice?

Shotgun going to 5

for reasons

My B.

It is one point for every level of aptitude.

You could bring a skill up to 4 from 0 with ten points.

OkCrystal Saint Claire:

You level up Shooting.

ThatCrystal Saint Claire:

Right now, is 1Crystal Saint Claire:

so 2 points makes it 2Crystal Saint Claire:

Five points would make it 3.

Which I would suggest if you want to shoot people.

So now...

I have 5 points.

And many chips I can spend, if I have toCrystal Saint Claire:

Oh. You gonna be okay?Crystal Saint Claire:

Is there anything I can do to help?Crystal Saint Claire:

I dunno, send you five bucks for a can of red bull or soemthing?Crystal Saint Claire:

How'd that happen? Deets later

I forgot to close the gas cap during a car wash.

oh.Crystal Saint Claire:

I have an in, or you can run one of your own!

Is she working on anything today?

She is.Crystal Saint Claire:

And she has not eaten since breakfast.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano turns up!

Yesterday.Crystal Saint Claire:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano turns up with a hot can of pork and beans.

"Ey. Crystal?"
Said Nephi

"...Hello, Delano."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire is a little pale, and a little sleepy-looking, but awake enough to recognize him.

"I think I've almost got this figured out!"
Said Crystal

Nephi "Longiron" Delano puts the can in front of her nose.

"Ya haven't eaten since... Darned if I know."
Said Nephi

"Chow down."

"What's in the can?"
Said Crystal

"Pork and beans."
Said Nephi

"Would you like the pork bits?"
Said Crystal

"...You don't eat pork?"
Said Nephi

"Whitney says I'm not supposed to eat them"
Said Crystal

"...Aw heck, you ain't buyin into her whole Adventist stuff, are ya?"
Said Nephi

"If I try to copy her nutritional intake..."
Said Crystal

"Maybe I'll get bigger, too..."

Crystal Saint Claire looks down...

"Meat's good for kids, Crystal."
Said Nephi

"I was always last to the table, and look at me. Skinny as a rail no matter how much I eat."

"Technically the protein from meat can be substituted from legumes"
Said Crystal

"Sure it can."
Said Nephi

"Don't help any with the gas."

"I never had that issue..."
Said Crystal

"Peanuts are a form of legume, yes."

"See? Told ya."
Said Nephi

"The point is that I am trying not to eat meat for a bit, to see if it works."
Said Crystal

"I dunno about you, but I think Whitney's got some other secret than diet to why she's

bigger'n a Steam Wagon."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

possible her ancestry took a role in her size..."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"But I would like to believe there is a way I can get bigger."

"Even if the doctors say I can't."

this kinda thing, I figger."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"I kept growin til about a year ago, myself."

"I... am different."
Said Crystal

"Naw."
Said Nephi

"Yer just like us, Crystal."

"A right friendly weirdo."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano smirks.

"Biologically speaking."
Said Crystal

"The production of chemicals in my body that cause the growth typically associated with children my age has been

"...In ah, smaller words?"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano thinks for a minute.

"...Wait, no, ah think I get it."
Said Nephi

"Ah cannie grow up. Simple 'nough?"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire covers her mouth with both hands after her Irish accent slips out

"..."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano blink blinks.

"Did... Did you just..."
Said Nephi

"...I am so sorry."
Said Crystal

"No, no, it ain't a problem."
Said Nephi

"My da sometimes would dip into french when he got real mad."

"It comes out when I am nervous, or... overly emotional."
Said Crystal

"Yer a silly one, Crystal. Now stop arguin and eat yer beans!"
Said Nephi

"...And show me whatcha workin on. I'm a mite curious."

"And I'm here if you need an extra pair of hands."

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire eats the beans, picking out the pork and placing it on the lid.

"Remember when we talked about making a little shotgun that could go on the front of a

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Yeaaaaah?"
Said Nephi

"I think I have a design that might work!"

"...Tell me more."
Said Nephi

oh my fckng god

Crystal Saint Claire is finally asleep after working for a long time..

(Same)Crystal Saint Claire:

whut we doin'?

with the group for at least a day, maybe more...

Crystal Saint Claire:

Dunno what Cass and Eileen have been up to...

Hm.Crystal Saint Claire:

Maybe Crystal can wander into that.

I am back

roger dogerWhitney G. Elieen:

At... I wanna say the hotel?

If it is the hotel place, then...Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire wakes up from her long period of being asleep in the corner.

Give us a tick.

Oh hello.Crystal Saint Claire:

You may have several.

I have many specimenss.

It is a late night at the Kansas City Hotel. Most of the patrons have gone to their

rooms. Most of them have partaken of good food, good drink, and will soon partake of good company. There are a

few left on the ground floor. The waiters and some peculiar new folk stay up to drink and chat as the moon cools

the dry earth.

Crystal Saint Claire yawns and stretches, looking around to remember where she fell asleep this time.

Upon realizing she's in secluded corner of a public space, she gathers her things close and looks for an

exit. Fortunately, she spots a more appealing option: Whitney!

Crystal Saint Claire waves like a little spaz.

Whitney G. Elieen looks over from her cup of cold water and smiles right back.

Whitney G. Elieen waves and motions for her much smaller friend to come.

Cassie-May O'Brien blinks and turns to where Whitney's smiling.

"...Crystal? How long were you here?"
Said Cassie-May

"...I had lunch here... and then... I fell asleep... so... what time is it?"
Said Crystal

"God bless you child. I was thirsting for your company and it has been provided to me."
Said Whitney

"Please. Sit with me."

"Sure!"
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen scoots over so that Crystal may join her

Crystal Saint Claire is looking at the table.

"...Well now Ah feel plum unnecessary."
Said Cassie-May

"...you are not."
Said Crystal

"There are things you can help her with that I cannot."

"No. Your company here has been God sent just as much as Crystals."
Said Whitney

"Such as fashion. Or self-defense tips. Or romantic help. Or..."
Said Crystal

"Though I have missed her dearly"
Said Whitney

"Or..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire thinks.

"Cowboy... things."
Said Crystal

"...you missed me?"

Crystal Saint Claire does not look up from the table.

"I thought maybe you were mad at me after the ting with Nephi and the measurements..."
Said Crystal

"Of course I have~ I am in need of the company of friends. Cassie was so kind as to provide

this for me, but your presence is...-"

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Oh Crystal!"

"Why would I ever be angry with you over that?"

"...because my hand was between your breasts for a considerable period of time."
Said Crystal

"...Nephi an' them measurements?"
Said Cassie-May

"I uh-

"Whut did Ah miss."

"And I impersonated Christ when confrontedCrystal Saint Claire:

"And you are sorry for impersonating the Lord? Have you prayed for forgiveness?"
Said Whitney

"And yes...for clarity she was hoping to suprise me with a gift! The gift of armor to be exact."

"She needed my measurements."

"I am... and did... You were there."
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen smiles even wider

"Also, I finished the armor..."
Said Crystal

"So what then is the problem?~"
Said Whitney

Cassie-May O'Brien pinched the bridge of her nose and snorted a laugh.

(Note: I will be gone soon.)

(You might wanna put a token for Rockett on the table then0Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Oi! Ah don' see what so funni about try'na give someone a gift--"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire claps both hands over her mouth as soon as she realizes her accent is coming out.

(I think Scotty might be coming around later, so I'm going to leave Rockett here.)

Whitney G. Elieen wraps an arm around Crystal and pulls her in close

Whitney G. Elieen giggles

Crystal Saint Claire seems mortified.

Cassie-May O'Brien:

(there)

"...it was an accident..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire is staring at the table now...

"Tha's even funnier!"
Said Cassie-May

"...it is still somewhat fresh in my memory... and I would appreciate it... not coming up in

conversation for a bit..."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Feel not embarrassed. I hold no ill will towards you! When you think about it...it truly is an

amusing tale~"

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Until time has had the chance to ease the humiliation..."
Said Crystal

"Oh you poor thing..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen squeezes that much tighter.

Crystal Saint Claire makes a noise halfway between a squeak and a gurgle.

"Respitory functionailty decreased..."
Said Crystal

(Respiratory)

(Yes that.)Crystal Saint Claire:

"Jus' breathe in through yer nose an' outta yer mouth. Deep breaths.Cassie-May O'Brien:

Whitney G. Elieen lessens her grip just a bit...

Crystal Saint Claire can breathe again...

"Sorry...sometimes I forget myself."
Said Whitney

Crystal Saint Claire hugs Whitney as tight as she can.

"...Shucks, yew two are close, ain'cha?"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien chuckled, seeing the two.

"One coulda thing yew two are sis-"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien busied herself with the beer.

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire blushes a little.

"Whitney has taught me a lot about... things I did not learn in school."
Said Crystal

"Such as bodily maintenance."

"...Beg yer pardon."
Said Cassie-May

(Insert masturbation joke here)

"Eat at least twice a day, try to sleep before midnight, that sort of thing."
Said Crystal

"Yes. I have been teaching her the ways of healthy living."
Said Whitney

(Wait doc)Crystal Saint Claire:

"She has even been excercising with me in the morning!"
Said Whitney

Crystal Saint Claire nods.

"She has such a sharp mind already...a sharp body can only do her good."
Said Whitney

"I can do eight push-ups!"
Said Crystal

"Lord be praised! She smiles down on your efforts."
Said Whitney

"..."
Said Crystal

"That is new."

"Typically I have only heard you use male pronouns in reference to the Lord."

"Lord is, in fact, a male title, no?"

"Ah know, righ'? It's God Father..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien smirked at Whitney.

"Indeed. The result of a male dominated culture which helped to shape our earthly church.

Paltry when compared to the true majesty of God."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"A majesty that can be ill defined by such strict binaries. God is he. She is also she. They are so much more."

(I already did a Nephi Token)

Whitney G. Elieen smiles right back

(Just assume I'm a step ahead all the time.)

"That is a nice way to look at it."
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien shrugged.

(I will do no such thing. If I assume you are a step behind, I will be pleasantly surprised.)Crystal Saint Claire:

"I had the good fortune of seeing and speaking with her myself. You would be surprised. Far

from the vision of an earthly middle aged man with greying hair."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Ah suppose it doesn' matter. It's not like Ah'm gunna ever git interested in whutever th'

Almighty got between 'em legs."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

(Have you been right so far?)

"If we meet any ranking officials of the church... I feel they may not appreciate this conversation."

"Indeed. For God the father is vast and powerful. What resides in between is...an interesting

speculation. But meaningless to her true message."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"And I would not be the first who ran afoul of the Pharisee"

"Jesus in his time was quite the rebel. He spoke the truth of God's love and was hated for it."

"Ah liked tha' part when he grabbed a rope an' went an' smacked merchants outta church."
Said Cassie-May

"...But Jesus got back up after they killed him. I do not want to test if you are similarly...

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Matthew 21-12. I always enjoyed that one. It shows a more human Jesus, who was so

frustrated by the perversion of God's message that he had to grab a rope and lead them out."

Whitney G. Elieen:

Whitney G. Elieen squeezes, though only slightly so

"Do not worry Crystal...I can't speak for God's plan but I can guess she has more in store for

me yet. I am not going anywhere..."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"...I hope not..."
Said Crystal

"You are already walking the right path Crystal. God loves you. And so do I."
Said Whitney

"I won't be leaving you. Not if I have any say."

Crystal Saint Claire freezes.

Cassie-May O'Brien coughs into her fist.

"..."
Said Whitney

"..."
Said Crystal

"Something I said?"
Said Whitney

". . ."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire doesn't even seem to notice the Irish brogue sneaking back into her voice...

"S'jes' that... I'll tell y'later."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire buries her bright red face in her arms

"...of course Child. Whenever you are comfortable."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen says with a look of worry

"...Oh boy."
Said Cassie-May

"If you fear I am going to leave you behind, then do not be."
Said Whitney

"I know what that feels like and would not wish it upon you."

"Or anyone."

"..."
Said Crystal

"Speaking as such...you will get to meet my sister soon."
Said Whitney

"I must advise caution...and patience with her."

Crystal Saint Claire sits up.

"You have a sister?"
Said Crystal

"...yes I do."
Said Whitney

"It has been sometime since we have met."

"...is she like you?"
Said Crystal

"Oh, eeeeeenope."
Said Cassie-May

"Lemme bluntly interject here."

"This is why oyu are necessary"
Said Crystal

"Rockett ain' nothin' like Whitney 'ere, an' them's lotta bad blood 'tween 'em."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Crystal

"Which Ah kinda hope ta help smooth out at least a lil'."
Said Cassie-May

"That is good."
Said Crystal

"Yes...thank you for your help"
Said Whitney

"I fear this will take a long while to heal though. Such is the word of God."

"And my own thoughts."

"Eeeeeyup. 'S gunna take a while, sugercube. Ah'm gunna call it a success if Ah at least

help yew two git on speakin' terms."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Maybe I can help... I am not excellent at that sort of thing, but if it will help Whitney, I will

Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire is Smol Determination

"If you think it wise Child...I am blessed you would help me. Though I warn you she can be

very snappy."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Do not take what she says to heart."

(I shall return.)Crystal Saint Claire:

"...Speakin' of, Ah wonder if she's done wit'..."
Said Cassie-May

"I do not think she will be done for a long while..."
Said Whitney

"I had planned to book a room here if need be."

"I pray that God will shield my ears tonight."

"Dunnaw, them wuzn' that loud."
Said Cassie-May

"Down here perhaps. The next few rooms over though may be a different tale."
Said Whitney

"Ah put mah ear ta them door."
Said Cassie-May

"I suppose all shall be revealed in time. I pray for such fortune tonight. If I must wait a night."
Said Whitney

"Eeeyup..."
Said Cassie-May

"...So how wuz yer childhood like, Whitney?"
Said Cassie-May

"...it was not perfect. Father was strict. Mother had little voice. The children used to mock me

for being so large..."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"I took respite in God though I harbored resentment in my heart toward her for making me stand out so."

"Realleh naw..."
Said Cassie-May

"Y'all got any other siblings?"

"Aside from Judy? No. She is my only sister."
Said Whitney

"No other fam'leh? Jus' yew two now?"
Said Cassie-May

"Just us. On this earth."
Said Whitney

"If I had any other family I am not aware of them."

"Mmmmeeyup. Also, sugercube... Y'all realleh wanna use th' name Rockett wit' her, Ah

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"...I shall refer to her as my sister. No more. No less."
Said Whitney

"I will avoid her true name. Around her."

"Guess tha's an acceptable compromise."
Said Cassie-May

"Indeed..."
Said Whitney

"If this is what it takes."

"God suggested that I meet her half way. You speak the advice of the divine."

"Perhaps I will buy her...a drink. That too was suggested."

"...Guess tha's anuther name fer common sense, hyuk."
Said Cassie-May

"An' tha's a gewd idea. Alcoholic one."

"Far too many have falling prey to the drink. It has robbed them of their better senses, it adds

unnecessary weight and it puts a strain upon the liver."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"But one beer so that my sister may talk with me is acceptable."

"Sure does."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien said flatly, staring at Whitney and guzzling down the remaining half of her beer bottle

in defiance.

Whitney G. Elieen tilts her head and frowns

"Brrueerk."
Said Cassie-May

Poage is still facedown.

"God bless."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen pulls Crystal close

"Sure he does!"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien put the empty bottle back on the table and grinned.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads over to the others.

Whitney G. Elieen sips at her water

Crystal Saint Claire is pulled towards Whitney

Cassie-May O'Brien scratches her head

Crystal Saint Claire is mumbling something

"I wonder...how does it taste?"
Said Whitney

"Whut, beer?"
Said Cassie-May

"I have never had a drink before. I do not plan on it either!"
Said Whitney

"Yes. That."

"Bubbly, bitter an' bready."
Said Cassie-May

"...hmmm. Odd. Though I suppose one does not drink for flavor."
Said Whitney

"Huh. Guess i aint missing much."
Said Nephi

"...what's going on?"

"Ain' a bad taste either. Welp, actually, dependinCassie-May O'Brien:

on th' beer."

"By client, ya mean...?"

"Ah mean she's fuckin'."
Said Cassie-May

"Do ya have ta put it like that?"
Said Nephi

"Whut? Is how it is."
Said Cassie-May

"She does speak the truth..."
Said Whitney

"...Ah really dont wanna have this conversation right now."
Said Nephi

"...so. Any of you play cards?"

"Ain' got cash fer bettin'. 'Specially now thut Ah bought all tha' beer."
Said Cassie-May

"I do not. I am sorry."
Said Whitney

"I try to avoid games of chance, and all things associated with them." She says, blissfully unaware that she is, in

Cassie-May O'Brien looks up at the screen

"...what's gotten into you both?"
Said Nephi

"...got a weird feelin' there."
Said Cassie-May

"Whuddya mean, Nephi?"

"...Ehh."
Said Nephi

"Speak freely Nephi."
Said Whitney

"What troubles you, son of Joseph?"

"Probably noyhing."
Said Nephi

Cassie-May O'Brien shrugged.

"In the meantime, we still heading to Dodge City?"
Said Nephi

"Eeyup."
Said Cassie-May

"Either of you two been before?"
Said Nephi

"Ah wuz in' passin'. Rockett wuz there, knows a nice bar."
Said Cassie-May

"Once I believe. Not for long."
Said Whitney

"Jumped trains there. My brother Alma works for the Union railroad. Helped me get

there without getting shot."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"How 'bout yew, Crystal?"
Said Cassie-May

one moment

kkWhitney G. Elieen:

me opens the door with a loud THUDRockett Rimjob:

"...Guess tha's mah cue."
Said Cassie-May

(off to a great start)Rockett Rimjob:

Cassie-May O'Brien stood up from the table...

Rockett Rimjob is quite ragged, her bonnet skewed to one side and bent, hair a mess over her bare

shoulders. Her dress is disheveled, and her countenance worn but... still angry, somehow/ You can smell

her sin from halfway across the room.

"...Howdy again."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien sashayed close.

kurwa mać

varmus are you drinkRockett Rimjob:

oRockett Rimjob:

Rockett Rimjob tries her best to fix herself, but really her minimal effort does next to nothing to make her

look any less of a mess.

"What?"
Said Rockett

whutever yer plannin' ta do."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Cassie-May O'Brien put her hands on her hips and shifted her weight on one leg.

"Sounds like brown-nosin'. Ah think Ah'll pass 'til t'morrow, sugar."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob sounds irate.

"Eeenope. Jus' talked ta Whitney an', ta translate from her language ta ours, she's real

sorry she's been a shit sister fer yew an' wants ta somehow fix tha'."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Cassie-May O'Brien shifted her weight to the other leg.

"On one hand, ain' mah business, on th' other, Ah try ta care fer mah friends, an' yer un'."
Said Cassie-May

"Neat."
Said Rockett

"Now if you'll excuse me."

Rockett Rimjob motions for Cass to scoot her boot.

Rockett Rimjob clearly does not give a single fuck about Whitney's wants.

th' only famileh yew have left. Mahbe it's werth it ta at least hear whut she has ta say ta yew before y'all blow her

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Cassie-May O'Brien moved aside to let Rockett pass.

"Angry as yew are at her, an' wit' good reason."
Said Cassie-May

"She's as much family ta me as a cow is to a horse. Ain't a chance in hell Ah'm givin' her tha

time'a day if Ah don't gotta."

Rockett Rimjob:

Rockett Rimjob shimmies her britches back up to her waist, gets them comfortable, and starts marching

"Wit' how yew two stubborn are, Ah'd guess yer both mules."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob clenches her fist. "Damn right Ah'm stubborn. Ah got it from pa. Sure Whitney already told

you all about that, didn't she?"

"Ah think yer in th' right 'bout all tha', yew know!"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien put her hands on her hips.

"An' Ah am takin' yer side, so mahbe go dunk tha' head in water ta cool off so yew can think

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Ah'll dunk yer fuckin' head, just you wait," she grumbles under her breath as she heads out the

Rockett Rimjob:

"Have it yer way. Guess yer ain' gunna be goin' ta meet Doc Mitchell if yer hatin's more

important than gittin' whoever killed her friend ta justice."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Ah am prett-ay sure tha' she's gunna go ta Dodge alone naw jus' ta spite erryun' an' deal wit' Doc Mitchell on 'er

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire looks up from her arms.

"Was that her?"
Said Crystal

"Eeeeyup."
Said Cassie-May

"Ah'm serious, git yer asses up now. If she ain' back through tha' door in ten minutes, means she's already left."

Crystal Saint Claire sighs.

"Where do you think she would be..? If she has not left."
Said Crystal

"...How would Ah know?"
Said Cassie-May

"Yew two are gunna keep sittin'?"

"I did not ask where you knew she would be, O'Brien."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire stands. She actually gets a bit shorter, standing.

"I asked for a guess."
Said Crystal

"I... sort of want to try talking to her."

Cassie-May O'Brien blink blinked, then spread her arms.

"How the fuck would Ah know? Ah don't know this city or where her favourite spots are,

Cassie-May O'Brien:

You hear an incredibly loud gunshot in the distance.Rockett Rimjob:

"...I think I can guess now."
Said Crystal

"Tha's her."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Nephi

Cassie-May O'Brien ran out in the direction of the gunshot!

"Should we be worried about that?"
Said Nephi

Crystal Saint Claire follows.

SighNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Crystal Saint Claire reaches into her bag, pulling out a little red shotshell and loading it into the Opus.

"I hope she's okay..."
Said Crystal

South. You head south, not far out of town, just past a cowhouse. As you get closer, you see a

bunch of bottles set up on the fence posts. One of them is quite shattered.

Rockett Rimjob:

Rockett is standing on the other side of the dirt road.

"..."
Said Cassie-May

"...You kiddin me."
Said Nephi

"Oh, that is a relief. Target practice!"
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien pulled out her Winchester and shot down one of the bottles.

"Think yer up ta sum' competition?"
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimjob looks.

Crystal Saint Claire walks parallel to Rockett, until she's behind her, then over towards her.

"..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob turns to face the group.

Cassie-May O'Brien puts the rifle on her shoulder and pushes her stetson up a bit.

Rockett Rimjob looks at Crystal as she moves.

"...y'all ain't gonna let this go, are ya."
Said Rockett

"...can you teach me to shoot? I have a gun, but... Little skill using it."
Said Crystal

"Not with this thang."
Said Rockett

goin' ta Dodge wit'us, so if yer wantin' ta go wit' us, yer gunna have ta grit yer teeth an' bear her company. An' if

yer already doin' tha', yew mighta as well shorten yerself the bullshit an' have her talk, if onleh ta let 'er say she

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Rockett Rimjob has an oversized, fancy-ass derringer dangling in her hand, pointed at the ground.

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire stares at the weapon.

Cassie-May O'Brien lowered her rifle and loaded a new bullet into the mag.

"...tell ya what."
Said Rockett

"You hit a bottle with this piece o' mine, an' maybe Ah'll give ya tha time'a day," she says, staring at Cass.

Cassie-May O'Brien blink-blinked.

"...Fahne."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien has a wiry frame and thin wrists. She ain't gonna have hands after shooting this thing

barring a miracle.

Rockett Rimjob cracks her derringer open, and pulls out the lone shell loaded inside. Then, she pulls a

bullet out of her pocket. Said bullet is three inches long and some change.

Cassie-May O'Brien seems to realize that, given the look on her face.

It's not too much smaller than the bullets used in Nephi's rifle, for reference.Rockett Rimjob:

"That is a large Derringer..."
Said Crystal

"Who made it?"

"Bond Arms. Houston."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien extended her hand to Rockett for the derringer.

'..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Crystal Saint Claire doesn't seem to understand the vibe of this situation...

Rockett Rimjob twirls it around a bit for kicks, then holds it out to Cass.

Rockett Rimjob holds out the bullet with her other hand.

"Do you have schematics? Anything? It looks fascinating..."
Said Crystal

"Can't say Ah do."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien grabs it and inspects for a moment, then steels herself with a sigh.

"...May I take a look at it later?"
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien turns to the bottles.

"Long as ya don't take it apart.Rockett Rimjob:

"...Would you like to see mine?"
Said Crystal

"Cass, use both hands. Grip tha everlovin' hell out of it, too, ya string bean."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien tries to steady and secure the little hellion as tightly as she can in the bend of her

other arm.

Cassie-May O'Brien leans forward on her legs, hoping to take at least some of the recoil into shifting her

weight back.

Cassie-May O'Brien takes careful aim at the bottle...

Rockett Rimjob smiles

First it's a Strength roll, target 8. Then it's a Shootin' roll for Pistols.Rockett Rimjob:

Unless Doc wants to be mean.

Doc is busy trick-or-treating, though.

Cassie-May O'Brien has 1d4 Strength

The lose condition is:Rockett Rimjob:

Your wrist breaks.

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Of course it is.Crystal Saint Claire:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano just watches this go on.

crackCassie-May O'Brien:0

Rockett Rimjob stops smiling

"..."
Said Crystal

"Ffffffffffffffuughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhggggg...!"
Said Cassie-May

Crystal Saint Claire looks at Cassie for a few seconds... then to Rockett...

"...Tha'... went 'bout as well as Ah thought..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien sucks a breath of air through her clenched teeth, holding tightly her broken wrist. At

least she didn't drop the gun.

"..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob looks at the bottle.

Crystal Saint Claire takes a deep breath.

oh rightCassie-May O'Brien:

that's a hit I think

"...Well. Ya hit tha darn thing."
Said Rockett

"Think ya hurt yerself more'n ya hurt tha bottle, though," she says, walking over to Cass.

"Wwwwwooo fuckin' hoo."
Said Cassie-May

Crystal Saint Claire starts digging through her bag.

Cassie-May O'Brien hissed.

Cassie-May O'Brien grabbed the derringer with her other hand and held it out to Rockett, her right wrist

obviously broken.

Rockett Rimjob takes it.

"Y'wanna talk 'bout this while we head out ta meet Doc Mitchell?"
Said Rockett

"Ah think yer gonna need 'em."

Cassie-May O'Brien took a look at her wrist.

Rockett Rimjob seems to be at least vaguely familiar with this situation.

"I think I might be able to help with that defect..."
Said Crystal

"Maybe some sort of brace, or... Anything really."0

"Outta all them feudin' sisters Ah decided ta pick th' two built like motherfuckin' cocksuckin'

draft horses an' have one shoot a damn cannon."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Cassie-May O'Brien hissed again through her teeth.

"...Let's git back ta th' hotel. Ah think Whitney's still in there."
Said Cassie-May

"To be fair, the recoil is likely-- oh! Whitney can fix your hand, Miss O'Brien!"
Said Crystal

"Tha's whut Ah fucking hope fer, eeyup."
Said Cassie-May

"Remember? Like she did with the conductor's ear!"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire doesn't look up from the gun in her hands the whole time.

Cassie-May O'Brien just bumped her hip in Rockett's ass.

"Come on, Rimjob."
Said Cassie-May

"Given Ah jus' willingly broke mah hand fer this, yew owe meh this much."

"..."
Said Rockett

"...honestly Ah can't even be upset at that."

"That's impressive."

"Told ya, Ah try lookin' out fer mah friends."
Said Cassie-May

"Let's get goin', Ah suppose."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien started walking back to the hotel.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano follows the others.

Poage walks back towards the hotel, her eyes not leaving the ground the whole way.

(My web is DC'ing every ten seconds, and sometimes my computer won't reconnect.

"Whitney!"
Said Cassie-May

(So I have to Cold-restart.)Crystal Saint Claire:

Whitney G. Elieen looks over at the crowd

"Welcome back...I trust all is well?"
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen frowns

Cassie-May O'Brien showed her completely broken right wrist.

Crystal Saint Claire sits back over here, reaches through her bag, and pulls out a little black box with a

little red pepper on it.

"Ah got a booboo. Can yew fix it."
Said Cassie-May

Whitney G. Elieen reaches her hands out

"Let me see."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen takes her hand into her own

Whitney G. Elieen closes her eyes...

Cassie-May O'Brien lets her see, gritting her teeth.

Whitney G. Elieen:+02+01+0205

Whitney places her hand upon the wound and closes her eyes shut...saying a silent prayer that God may deliver

them from their wounds

Crystal Saint Claire studies the round for a few seconds, replaces it, and keeps shuffling through the bag.

I think Target umber is always 5, right?Crystal Saint Claire:

but between this and me throwing down a Red Chip I got from the Luck of the Irish, I think

he's gonna forgive us for me saying it worked.

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Fair.Crystal Saint Claire:

Cassie-May O'Brien grinned, flexing her now fixed wrist.

"...Much apprecciated."
Said Cassie-May

Whitney G. Elieen grimmaces for a moment

Crystal Saint Claire winces, watching Whitney.

"...Yer good?"
Said Cassie-May

he's helping trick or treaters.Rockett Rimjob:

Whitney G. Elieen pulls her hand back and grasps it

I know, just being an ass here.Cassie-May O'Brien:

Crystal Saint Claire moves closer to Whitney. "I might have something to make the pain a little less..."

Whitney G. Elieen takes in a deep breath

Whitney G. Elieen slowly lets it out

"painful..."
Said Crystal

"The pain is only temporary..."
Said Whitney

"And a fair trade for what it can do."0

"..."
Said Crystal

"Go with God Cassie."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen relaxes her hand

Crystal Saint Claire reaches into her bag and pulls out the Armored Vest she made for Whitney.

"Ah owe yew a favour, sugercube."
Said Cassie-May

"...here."
Said Crystal

Rockett Rimjob doesn't seem to be paying attention.

Cassie-May O'Brien looks over to Rockett.

Rockett Rimjob still wants nothing to do with Whitney.

"...Just... just in case."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire is holding it out.

"...hmmm?" She looks to the armor with a smile. "The vest...it is ready?"
Said Whitney

Crystal Saint Claire nods.

"Oh Crystal...thank you so much."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen grabs it.

"I made it green."
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen sets it down next to her

Whitney G. Elieen reaches forward and hugs

Crystal Saint Claire stiffens for a moment, then returns hugs.

"God bless you, my friend. Thank you for this mighty vestment."
Said Whitney

"P-please warn me... just... a second or two in advance..."
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien pointed on the table behind her.

"Ah think Ah've had enough drink."
Said Rockett

"Is that truly so?"
Said Whitney

"Or do you just not wish to drink with me around."

"It's like watching a bear come down on your head..."
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien pulled her glove off and flexed her now unbroken hand for a moment, then put the

glove back on.

"What part of you doubts that Ah'd have a drink if Ah wanned to, whether or not Ah had yer

Adventist ass preachin' up an' down tha bar?"

Rockett Rimjob:

I gotta do halloween stuff.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Rockett Rimjob glances at Cass' wrist, but says nothing.

believe tha' translates ta, shit, an' Ah wanted ta buy yew a drink."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"...she doesn't... really... preach."
Said Crystal

"Only fair I suppose...are there any other injuries that need healing?"
Said Whitney

"Ah think naw."
Said Cassie-May

"...and yes. If you would have it."
Said Whitney

"If this would have you sit and talk with me."

"Ass is kinda sore, so Ah ain't sittin' fer a spell. But fahne."
Said Rockett

"Cass went outta her way ta drag me in here. Ah owe 'er this much, at least."

"Don't think fer a second Ah'm doin' this fer you, Elieen."

"I never thought so to begin with Sister."
Said Whitney

Cassie-May O'Brien grabbed herself a beer.

Cassie-May O'Brien took a long swig.

"Cassie...please." She says as she produces some cash. "Buy my sister a drink. And bring

me another water if you would."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Can do."
Said Cassie-May

"For what it is worth I am sorry Sister. I have been for a long time. Ever since I woke up from

the injury you gave me."

Whitney G. Elieen:

Whitney G. Elieen hands the monez

"Bless you."
Said Whitney

Cassie-May O'Brien took the cash, then walked to the bartender.

Cassie-May O'Brien returned shortly with a water for Whitney and what appeared to be whiskey on the

rocks for Rockett.

Rockett Rimjob stares flatly at Cass. "When Ah said Ah wasn't thirsty no more, Ah meant it."

Cassie-May O'Brien shrugs.

"Fair enough. Yew two mind if in that case Ah...?Cassie-May O'Brien:

Cassie-May O'Brien gestured to the whiskey.

"I do not mind in the slightest."
Said Whitney

"Ain't mah whiskey."
Said Rockett

Crystal Saint Claire is just watching all this.

"You know I did not mean to hurt you sister."
Said Whitney

Cassie-May O'Brien sipped the whiskey instead, leaning on the table.

"I know you will not listen to what I have to say but this is the truth."
Said Whitney

Rockett Rimjob stares at Whitney, arms crossed. She stays silent and waits for her to continue, not

offering a single word.

"I was callous. I was a child and I had a child's understanding."
Said Whitney

Rockett Rimjob taps one of her fingers against her covered bicep.

"I was wrong. Father was wrong. My transgressions against you pushed you away."
Said Whitney

"Maybe someday you will forgive me. But It will not stop me from trying to make it right in the meanwhile."

"You still have the scars...don't you."

"Why d'you think Ah grew mah hair out?"
Said she

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Whitney G. Elieen reaches her hand over

Cassie-May O'Brien knocked the whiskey in one go.

"Let me see it"
Said Whitney

"No."
Said Rockett

"Helps with the strumpet disguise..."
Said Crystal

"Please."
Said Whitney

"Just this once."

Rockett Rimjob tuuurns to Crystal.

Rockett Rimjob blinks.

"Ah'll have you know this ain't no disguise, sweetie."
Said Rockett

Whitney G. Elieen gets up from her seat

Whitney G. Elieen walks over...standing at her full height

Rockett Rimjob takes a step back.

"Whitney please don't"
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen reaches her hand over

Cassie-May O'Brien holds her out in front of Whitney.

"Please...just this once."
Said Whitney

"And I will leave you alone"

"She said no."
Said Cassie-May

"You take a step closer an' you're gonna be wishin' Ah had a rock instead, Elieen."
Said Rockett

"Miss Rockett?"
Said Crystal

"Let me see it...and I will walk right out that door."
Said Whitney

"And you will never have to see me again"

"Whitney, she said no. Stop pushin'."
Said Cassie-May

"That's rich. If there's one thing Ah know it's that yer jus' as stubborn as Ah am. An' now that you

caught mah scent you ain't gonna get off mah trail 'til one of us dies."

Rockett Rimjob:

Cassie-May O'Brien had probably no way in hell of actually stopping Whitney if she really wanted to.

"You also know that, for all my faults, I am not a liar."
Said Whitney

"And when I make a promise...I keep it. Please. Just. This. Once."

"And I will go."

"Whitney please don't..."
Said Crystal

"..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob looks at Cass.

"Yew don't have ta, Rockett."
Said Cassie-May

"...Ya got what ya wanned. Hope yer happy," she says, turning around and making sure her hair

is well and down before heading to the door.

Rockett Rimjob:

"Ain' no fixin' a life of fuck-ups in one evenin'."
Said Cassie-May

Whitney G. Elieen steps forward

"No."
Said Whitney

"That is not what i meant."

"Yer still goin' ta Dodge w-"
Said Cassie-May

Whitney G. Elieen pushes past

Cassie-May O'Brien stumbles back

"Whitney please don't!"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire chases after

Rockett Rimjob tenses right up and clenches her fist.

"...Whoah nelly."
Said Cassie-May

"Let me see it."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen reaches her hand forward

Crystal Saint Claire steps between the two.

"Whitney, fer fuck's sake!"
Said Cassie-May

"Crystal. Please."
Said Whitney

"Let me do this."

"It ain' yer decision ta make whut Rockett is ta do."
Said Cassie-May

"Whitney... Right now, she is... going through a lot. She has probably spent... a long time...

thinking about what to do. If you asked... something like this. Or something similar, how this meeting would go,

what could happen..."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"No it is not. I am not forcing you...but you know I will not leave you alone until then."
Said Whitney

"What could go wrong."
Said Crystal

"I understand. Entirely."
Said Whitney

"No. Yer gunna leave her alone now, Whitney. Ah didn' break mah hand fer this jus' so yew

dunno where ta stop an' fold. Yew ain' fixin tha' in one evening."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"...I don't know what happened, but sometimes, the best way to move forward is to step

back for a bit."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"I am trying to make the one and only step I can make to making this right."
Said Whitney

"Please... just let her walk away. Let her win this."
Said Crystal

Rockett Rimjob is still facing away, looking over her shoulder.

"Please you two."
Said Whitney

"No, yer once again forcin' her ta do somethin' she doesn' want ta, an' not listenin' ta her."
Said Cassie-May

"This is the endgame, and you're trying to bring it about too early!"
Said Crystal

"Sit the fuck down."
Said Cassie-May

"A single touch is all I want. It is all I need."
Said Whitney

"Do you even understand what it is I am trying to do?"

"But it's now what she wants, or what she needs! Right now, you're being selfish!"
Said Crystal

"And whut 'bout whiut she wants an' needs?"
Said Cassie-May

"Please... just..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire sits.

"...please. you're scaring me..."
Said Crystal

"Ah'm gonna step through this door."
Said Rockett

"An' if you follow me a step further, yer gonna regret it."

"She ain' gunna unless through me. Go, Rockett. We're leavin' tomorrow at mornin' ta

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Cassie-May O'Brien positions herself between the two.

"Sister. I am asking you. Just this once."
Said Whitney

"Ah asked you once."
Said Rockett

"...that you did."
Said Whitney

"...I am going to let you go. But I am not going to give up. You know in your heart of hearts that there are two ways

to get rid of me."

(one sec)Rockett Rimjob:

Whitney G. Elieen turns away, but does not walk away

Crystal Saint Claire moves a little closer to Whitney.

Cassie-May O'Brien still tries to shield Rockett with her own body.

Cassie-May O'Brien realizes that both women could probably tie her into a pretzel if needed.

Cassie-May O'Brien does her best not to smile at the ridiculousness of it.

Crystal Saint Claire just silently reaches towards Whitney's hand.

boopWhitney G. Elieen:

That was a long, awkward silenceCrystal Saint Claire:

Rockett Rimjob looks at Whitney one more time.

Rockett Rimjob suddenly grabs Cass by the collar.

...of her jacket, not her neck.Rockett Rimjob:

Whitney G. Elieen turns her head around

""Gyak-!?"
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimjob pulls her on out of the bar.

"Yer comin' with me."
Said Rockett

"...uk, okay?"
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimjob yoinks

"..."
Said Crystal

"..."
Said Whitney

"...ain' like Ah got a choice there..."
Said Cassie-May

Whitney G. Elieen casts her eyes to the floor

Whitney G. Elieen turns back around and walks to the table

Cassie-May O'Brien waved the others goodbye sheepishly

Rockett Rimjob heads back out to where she was, letting go of Cass a few steps out the door.

Whitney G. Elieen sits down

Crystal Saint Claire follows Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen clasps her hands together

"...Ssso, uh..."
Said Cassie-May

Whitney G. Elieen closes her eyes and bows her head

"Tha' went better than Ah expected."
Said Cassie-May

Crystal Saint Claire sits, her face resting on her arms once more.

"Ah jus' about punched her ass out."
Said Rockett

"This close."

"This fuckin' close."

Rockett Rimjob holds out her thumb and index finger, about a centimeter apart.

Crystal Saint Claire is mumbling something.

"Lord...lend your hand to mine...let your words flow through me and give me the strength and

wisdom to reach her..."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"...Mmmeeeyup. Am Ah gunna git punched instead here, or...?"
Said Cassie-May

"How do I reach out? What do I say? What do I do?"
Said Whitney

"Grit yer teeth."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob winds up.

Rockett Rimjob thrusts her whole body--!

Cassie-May O'Brien grits

Rockett Rimjob stops her fist a few inches away from Cassie's face.

Cassie-May O'Brien didn't flinch. Too much.

"...much as Ah wanna punch somethin' right now."
Said Rockett

"Ain't gonna punch you."

"God...give me a sign. I am so lost..."
Said Whitney

Rockett Rimjob unclenches her fist, and reaches out to give Cassie a light, toying slap on her cheek

before walking on.

Whitney G. Elieen looks up to the celling

Cassie-May O'Brien blink-blinked.

Cassie-May O'Brien rubbed her cheek, confused.

"..So, means yer comin' ta Dodge wit' us, or...?"
Said Cassie-May

It was hardly a slap. If there was any pain at all, it was gone in an instant.Rockett Rimjob:

"How do I reach her? How do I save her? How do I even speak with her?"
Said Whitney

"Yeah. Ah got a score ta settle with Mitchell, so either way."
Said Rockett

(not a rub-away-pain thing, just a confused-rub)Cassie-May O'Brien:

Crystal Saint Claire finishes mumbling.

"...Welp, told yew when we leave. Ah'm glad, truth be told."
Said Cassie-May

Crystal Saint Claire sort of just... leans over to her left, slumping towards Whitney.

"Woulda miss seein' yer rowdy ass 'round."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Whitney

"Oh ye of little faith..." She says as she wraps her arms around Crystal.

Crystal Saint Claire starts mumbling something, then realizes she's mumbling.

"Jus' wait 'til Ah get an excuse ta punch some poor bastard..."
Said Rockett

"If them's any left after Ah'm done shootin'!"
Said Cassie-May

"Have you ever tried... debate? It was something the college used to make us do.."
Said Crystal

"What is there to debate?"
Said Whitney

"...I still remember the professor heading up the classes... His name Was Cecil B.

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Ev'ry now an' then Ah run across a fella that either ain't met me or don't got no respect for

women anyhow. Probly both, most cases."

Rockett Rimjob:

"I have confessed my sins. I have reached out. But I can not heal the unwilling."
Said Whitney

"Starts yappin'. Pissin' me off."
Said Rockett

"Ah'm a little patient. Ah give 'em time ta cut out. But sometimes..."

"He always used to say... if it first you don't succeed, don't try again."
Said Crystal

"A doctor can do nothing if their patient will not seek them..."
Said Whitney

"Change angles."
Said Crystal

"Change angles?"
Said Whitney

"Explain child. You have my interest."

"...it'll probly happen at least once in these next few weeks."
Said Rockett

"Jus' gunna remind yew tjaCassie-May O'Brien:

"Well... with a wall, you can just batter at one spot over and over until it breaks, or gives."
Said Crystal

technically Ah'm now a woman o' law, so try ta keep it within' reason so Ah don't gotta lie ta

stop yew outta hands o' law."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"But... arguments, people, minds are different. Subjective."
Said Crystal

"..."
Said Cassie-May

"Honey do you know who yer talkin' to?"
Said Rockett

"To put it simply... faith."
Said Crystal

"Ah jus' set mahself up fer a joke 'bout mah hands on yew, didn' Ah."
Said Cassie-May

"Well Ah wouldn't object."
Said Rockett

"You have faith in God. You have faith that what you are doing is right."
Said Crystal

"Darn temptress. Ah'm broke is gunna be mah defence!"
Said Cassie-May

"She has faith, as well. Maybe in difference things."
Said Crystal

"But naw. Believe it 'r not, Ah'm actually a Marshal mahself. Jus' not tha same kind that walks

around with three irons, a badge, an' a..."

Rockett Rimjob:

"And one of those things... seems to be the belief that whatever help you can provide comes

from a poisoned tree, so to speak."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"...well actually Ah'm gonna stop mahself there 'cause Ah got a bad attitude right about now. But

not always."

Rockett Rimjob:

"She quite clearly does not have faith in God. Or me. So how do I approach her then? If she

has no faith in either of us."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"..Huh."
Said Cassie-May

"There can be no healing unless she is willing."
Said Whitney

"I do not believe... if I could remove the scarification, that she would turn it down quite so

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Welp, tha' makes things easier."
Said Cassie-May

"Turns out they got a need fer a woman like me."
Said Rockett

"I do not know if she has issues with being healed. But she does have strong feelings about

you healing her."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"...oh my child. Do you not see? If she will not come to me then how can I possibly heal her?"
Said Whitney

"An' if she's not willin' to take your help, then you cannie help 'er, an' if she won' talk t'you

y'cannie tell her anythin'."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Tha's the point!"

"Woman that's got a nice pair of hoo-hahs an' a decent shot, willin' ta work both? Reckon Ah'm

not too common a breed."

Rockett Rimjob:

"Strength to change what you can."
Said Crystal

"Felicity to accept what you cannot."

"Wisdom to know the two apart."

"...Makes sense. Them folks git mighty chatty in bed wit' a pretty thing like yew."
Said Cassie-May

"She will not see. She will not speak. She will do nothing but hate me and I shall bear the

cross time and time again."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Oh you bet."
Said Rockett

"They hated him too you know. They despised him."
Said Whitney

"Ah got a few stories ta tell."
Said Rockett

"He came to them to offer salivation...and they pinned him to the cross."
Said Whitney

"Maybe Ah'll gab later. Not too sure how much Ah can say, but..."
Said Rockett

"If my sister would put me to the cross...then so be it."
Said Whitney

"Right now..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire takes a deep breath.

"Right now, you are incapable of saving her. And it is not only because she will not let you. It

is not only because you are approaching it wrong."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Technicalleh we're pardners."
Said Cassie-May

"But you will try anyway."
Said Crystal

"But if she does kill you... then what? What am I supposed to do?"

Crystal Saint Claire suddenly looks a lot more like a scared child.

"...I don't think I could..."
Said Crystal

"...oh hush child."
Said She

"...I do not know. I do not know if I could live with that...or forgive her."
Said Crystal

"Uh-huh. Ah know. Thing is Ah'm sworn ta secrecy 'bout some 'f this shit, an'..."
Said Rockett

"...ain't real simple stuff."

"Have faith. Have faith that I am here for a reason."
Said Whitney

"...But..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire hugs herself close to Whitney, as the larger woman won't budge...

"But nothing child. God would not have brought me here for nothing."
Said Whitney

"I must try. She is lost and needs help finding home. She is my family."

straight outta Hell..."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"She is the only family I have left here..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen leans her head forward and kisses you on the forehead.

"Broad with eyes like yours? Don't doubt it."
Said Rockett

"Calm now...everything will be alright. She will not kill me. She has tried already once before."
Said Whitney

"..."
Said Crystal

"IF she does."

"And yet I am here."
Said Whitney

Crystal Saint Claire suddenly draws very close to Whitney, whispering something into her ear.

"Mmmmeeeyup. Used ta werk fer th' Agency, if we're on th' secrets tellin' part."
Said Cassie-May

("im gonna need tree fiddy")Rockett Rimjob:

Cassie-May O'Brien kicked a pebble and shoved her hands into her pockets.

Crystal Saint Claire draws back.

"..."
Said Whitney

Crystal Saint Claire is shaking a little.

"Shhhhh..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen pulls her back

"..."
Said Crystal

"Shhhhh...calm. Be calm...I am here still..."
Said Whitney

"And unless I am called to heaven it is here I shall remain."

Whitney G. Elieen slowly lifts herself up

Whitney G. Elieen is still holding crystal in her arms

Crystal Saint Claire buries her face in Whitney's shoulder.

"Walk with me child."
Said Whitney

"...Huh. Really?"
Said Rockett

Whitney G. Elieen sets her down

Crystal Saint Claire walks, still shaking a little.

"How'd that gig treat ya?"
Said Rockett

"This place reeks of sin."
Said Whitney

"This is not the place for a sobering discussion."

"...All right..."
Said Crystal

"Eh. Ah quit. Didn' like tha' whole hush-hush policy of them."
Said Cassie-May

Whitney G. Elieen walks out into the town, hand in hand with Crystal.

"...Probably shouldn' git mahself any close ta actual Agents, though. Mighta got a price on

mah head?"

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Crystal Saint Claire walks out, holding tight onto Whitney's hand, a little red around the eyes...

"Miiight be wise."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien shrugged with a sheepish grin.

"She likes to think she is the only one who has suffered."
Said Whitney

"Or you could just hire a bodyguard."
Said Rockett

"I d-don't think... so..."
Said Crystal

Rockett Rimjob waggles her eyebrows.

"You do not know her the way I do."
Said Whitney

"Dunnaw, sugercube. Yew know any tha' coulda keep up wit' meh~?"
Said Cassie-May

"I know... a good bit... about suffering, though."
Said Crystal

"I had to... study it. For a class."

"She thinks she is the only one who was beaten. She was the only one who has had to walk

in pain...but she is not the only one. For five years I have wandered. Alone. With only the All mighty as my

Whitney G. Elieen:

"She is not the only one who has suffered though...and neither am I."

"...that hurt mah feelin's."
Said Rockett

"Tell me your troubles, child."
Said Whitney

Rockett Rimjob pouts.

"You are my friend. You are among the few who are."
Said Whitney

"I... do not remember them."
Said Crystal

"Many of them... were what the doctors, my uncle told me..."

"In the room. I will show you."

"...Your uncle..."
Said Whitney

"Like my father?"

"No."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire bristles visibly.

Whitney G. Elieen raises her eyebrow

"In the room."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen squeezes

legs up ta sky, went an' stole two army cannons, glued 'em tagether an' insists on callin' tha' a derringer."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Crystal Saint Claire nods.

"...Ah act'ally had it made by a rich ass gunsmith in Houston."
Said Rockett

"...I wish I could show you Crystal."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen eventually finds a bench where she sits

Whitney G. Elieen pats her lap

"Coulda fooled meh."
Said Cassie-May

Whitney G. Elieen has taken up the entirey of the bench

"Told 'em if he could make me a gun bigger'n 'is dick."
Said Rockett

"Had a sense a' humor, he did."

Crystal Saint Claire sits.

"Huh. Well then. Musta been quite a hoss."
Said Cassie-May

"...they look to me and they see a mad woman."
Said Whitney

Crystal Saint Claire is sitting in Whitney's lap.

"They have not seen it crystal"
Said Whitney

"They see the power of God and yet they still do not believe. If they knew the home that awaited them..."

"Had ta have a laugh. Barrel's just as long."
Said Rockett

"I have not seen Heaven either. But I have seen things most would call impossible. So I

choose to keep an open mind."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"But when he told me what it shot Ah just about shit mahself."
Said Rockett

"So if anybody ever tells me, 'size don't matter...'"

"I have walked the Garden of Eden. I spoke with God out in her palace. Walking on a bridge

of stars towards an endless sky..."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"All around me...angels. Clouds. Mountains. Waterfalls. Palaces...."

"Well, it wuz too much ta handle fer this lil' gal 'ere."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien winced with a grin, rubbing her mended wrist.

"You should try... to draw it."
Said Crystal

"...same thing happened ta me."
Said Rockett

"You all right?"

"...to try and draw it would be..."
Said Whitney

"Eeeyup. Righ' as new."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien flexed her wrist.

"Well...like you trying to explain your degree to me."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen says with a chuckle

"But...but I can try."
Said Whitney

"It can be hard though. The colors of heaven are not the colors of earth."

"And the blueprints I draw are never what I see in my mind."
Said Crystal

"Good. Woulda felt like shit if ya had ta deal with that fer too long."
Said Rockett

"It is about accepting that things need not be perfect."
Said Crystal

"..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen sighs

"Aw, shucks. So yew like meh after all!"
Said Cassie-May

"I would rather have a good invention finished... Than a perfect one that I never realize."
Said Crystal

"Because one can change things."

"If yer wrist's broken you'd have ta tickle me with yer lame hand."
Said Rockett

"I feel the wisdom of God speaking through you..."
Said Whitney

"I am just too weak to comprehend it just yet."

""That's fine! Just comprehend a little of it!"
Said Crystal

"I try and reach as many as I can...in the only way I know. With a power that is leant to me

from on high."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"..."
Said Cassie-May

"And it is a most perfect power. Failed only by this vessel."
Said Whitney

"Finish comprehending the little bit, and maybe next time you can get a little more!"
Said Crystal

Rockett Rimjob smirks

Cassie-May O'Brien smacked Rockett's shoulder.

"Ah coulda put mah boot up yer arse!"
Said Cassie-May

"Rome was not built in a day."
Said Crystal

"It'd get stuck."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob chuckles as she stumbles to the side

"Prob'leh."
Said Cassie-May

Crystal Saint Claire beams at Whitney, her eyes still a little red.

"Then you'd be out a perfectly good boot."
Said Rockett

"Fuck naw, Ah'd jus' wear yew."
Said Cassie-May

"...I am blessed to know you"
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen reaches her hand over

Whitney G. Elieen rubs her eyes a bit, as gently as she could.

"Then you'd have tha sexiest boot this side of the Mississippi."
Said Rockett

"An' th' snarkiest. Tha'd make heads turn."
Said Cassie-May

"You are an engineer. I am a servent of the greatest engineer of all."
Said Whitney

"Together we can solve this problem."

"Makin' heads turn is mah business."
Said Rockett

Crystal Saint Claire also nods.

"Together, we can do anything, probably."
Said Crystal

"Help me. Help me reach her. Together we can walk the halls of heaven...and then you will

see "

Whitney G. Elieen:

"God is not the creature so many make her out to be."

"Tha's startin' ta sound like a gewd idea. Ah dunno whut 'bout kickin' doors down."
Said Cassie-May

"She is...gentle. Suprisingly so."
Said Whitney

"I think... that reaching your sister... Will not be easy, or quick."
Said Crystal

"When your eyes adjust to the light"
Said Whitney

"Ah'll kick while you swing."
Said Rockett

'Double-kickin' power."

"Or you could jus' use mah forehead as a ram."

"No it will not be."
Said Whitney

"Sure is thick enough! Them's un' problem wit' tha'."
Said Cassie-May

"It will not require determination, or strength... or... some... third thing..."
Said Crystal

"But to follow in the example of christ I will keep at it. Even if she would put me up on a

Whitney G. Elieen:

"It will require care, and tenderness, and, occasionally, it will take doing nothing."
Said Crystal

"You wouldn't wanna wreck mah pretty face?"
Said Rockett

"She advised the same with you, you know."
Said Whitney

"Thought more 'bout th' fact Ah don't think Ah coulda lift yew. Yer build like a brick

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"I asked her about you...in my prayers."
Said Whitney

"...Your sister advised you about..."
Said Crystal

"No. Not her."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen points to the sky

"Point. Means we gotta switch."
Said Rockett

Crystal Saint Claire begins to turn very, very red.

"Bend over."
Said Rockett

"And I asked her about..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen places a finger on your forehead

(brb gotta go back home)Whitney G. Elieen:

"Yew wish."
Said Cassie-May

Crystal Saint Claire is almost the same colour as a new brick wall.

Rockett Rimjob chuckles.

"Don't like gettin' yer ass felt?"
Said Rockett

"Nawt by them boots."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Crystal

"Well why not? Too big?"
Said Rockett

"Do Ah look like Ah'm used ta gettin' plowed by flagpoles?"
Said Cassie-May

"Ah can go slow an easy, you delicate little flower you."
Said Rockett

"Sounds bettah. Lots a' kissin', lots a' curious fingers roamin..."
Said Cassie-May

"That don't sound too bad."
Said Rockett

"Most folks think that them payin' mah salary buys them a one-way ticket ta pound town on tha Rockett Express.

An'... well, it does. But dealin' with stallions like that all day ain't easy."

"Been a few easy-goers, though. Usually tha better ones."

"...Eh. Ah like it slow mahself..."
Said Cassie-May

"Different strokes fer different folks."
Said Rockett

"Heeeeeell of a lotta different strokes."

Rockett Rimjob idly pulls out her derringer and gives it a once-over.

"Eeeyup."
Said Cassie-May

"It is true my child...and she responded."
Said Whitney

Poage looks like she's going to start giving off steam at any second.

"She has told me...to have wisdom. To have patience. To be gentle."
Said Whitney

"My dearest Crystal...you move me with your affection."

"I say this unto you...very few have ever confessed as such to me."

"...bein' around tha block much as Ah have really shows ya how different folks can be."
Said Rockett

"Ain't been a day on this job that I ain't met a person with a lot more ta show than jus' 'is package. An' almost ev'ry

time they don't even know they showin' it."

"Most men are intimidated by my size. Most women do not pay a glance ether. In fact I was

unsure of myself until I had gotten my answer..."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Crystal. A question."

"...why?"
Said Crystal

"Some folks say it's jus' sex. That's true, sorta. Nothin' wrong with it."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien looked up at Rockett.

"I am not remarkable. My power is borrowed."
Said Whitney

"Most consider me insane...or unapproachable."

"But it don't matter how much ya try ta make it 'jus' sex' -- it ain't gonna change how ya grab on

to 'em, how ya feel 'em up, how ya look at 'em, how ya breathe, how ya move, how ya speak to 'em..."

Rockett Rimjob:

"Both sometimes."
Said Whitney

"One way 'r another, it's got a personal touch. Ain't no two hombres tha same in tha sheets."
Said Rockett

"Ah think it's sorta like bein' a nurse. Only you ain't mendin' wounds -- yer helpin' some poor sod detox. Destress.

Stop feelin' lonely fer a spell."

"...for many reasons. I find you beautiful. I enjoy your company. You talk with me, and try to

understand rather than write me off as some child genius sideshow. But... I think the most important thing is...

what you said. What you say."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Folks can call me a slut all they like. Ah think it's a noble profession."
Said Rockett

"...pay ain't too bad at all, neither."

Rockett Rimjob digs into her bag and pulls out a light cigar.

"It would be easy to love you because you are strong, or because you have... the abilities

you do."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Yer sellin' companionship an' closeness. Ain' somethin' found oftenCassie-May O'Brien:

'ere in th' West. Nawt ta feel lonely, if jus' fer a moment."

"...Sex ain' too bad at all, neither?"

Cassie-May O'Brien smiled at Rockett.

"...but you don't act like that. Like... like everyone is supposed to love you, because you are

who you are."

Crystal Saint Claire:

Rockett Rimjob scoffs a bit. "Depends on tha customer."

"Depends on what they want. How much they wanna be in control."
Said Rockett

"It is difficult to explain..."
Said Crystal

"An' how much they know 'bout what they're doin'."
Said Rockett

"You are not, alone, remarkable."
Said Crystal

"Ya'd think detectives 're rarer'n albino bison with how few of those poor bastards can't find yer

Rockett Rimjob:

"Nobody really is, are they?"
Said Crystal

"Anyone who is remarkable has had help. And time."

"My sister...is remarkable. Nephi is remarkable. You Crystal...you are remarkable."
Said Whitney

kinda stands out."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"I do not know... about Nephi. But I had help."
Said Crystal

"And so do I."
Said Whitney

"Correct."
Said Crystal

"The very best help of all. Without her...I am nothing."
Said Whitney

"Alone, without anyone's influence... You would be average, and I would be dead."
Said Crystal

"Sometimes ya run across someone that either wants you ta take charge, or knows what tha hell

they're doin'. Not as common, but those're pretty fun."

Rockett Rimjob:

"But you understand that. You don't act like... like the remarkability is yours and yours

Crystal Saint Claire:

"...I love you because... b-because..."

"I cannot explain."

Cassie-May O'Brien put her hands in her pockets again and kicked another pebble.

"...Ah wouldn' know."
Said Cassie-May

"...like trying to explain heaven."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen chuckles

"There are things that cannot be explained."
Said Crystal

"Love. Music. Humor. Religion."

"You end up sounding like a fool."
Said Whitney

"Speaking of greater things."

"You cannot explain them without using them as reference, or else they fall apart."
Said Crystal

"Take it you've never tango'd before?"
Said Rockett

"But the point is not to explain them."
Said Crystal

"The point is the trying."

"Professor Cecil always said that if you give someone an answer, then they have an answer."

had naw idea whut we wuz doin'. Paw caught us in th' barn."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"But if you give them a question, they will find their own answers, and those will be so much

more precious to them."

Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire is speaking unusally clearly, no trace of her usual muttering and mumbling.

"My sabbath school teacher used to say that!"
Said Whitney

"So... the reason I love you... is because I love you. Right now, that is all I can say."
Said Crystal

"Chased th' poor boy wit' a pitchfork while he tried ta put his pants on... Ah jus' yelled at 'im

ta stop an' started throwin' potatoes at mah Paw there."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"And I say this to you Crystal...your reason is reason enough to me."
Said Whitney

"Beyond the love of God...it has been a long time since anyone has said that to me."

"Not since...mother actually. My sister loved me once. Father did as well. In his own flawed way."

Rockett Rimjob chuckles at that, shaking her head as she lights up her cigar. "Sounds about right. It's

funny. Lotsa paws out there do it 'cause their angry, but some of 'em don't even do it 'cause they're

worried or upset. Lot of 'em know their daughter's grown, an' that this is inevitable. They jus' wanna have

a story ta tell an' somethin' ta laugh at later. Like it's a tradition."

"...it ain't a safe gamble ta call any bluffs, though. Ah know Ah'd be runnin' if Ah was some poor

jackass with his pants around his ankles an' a pitchfork at his back."

Rockett Rimjob:

Whitney G. Elieen reaches around her neck

Whitney G. Elieen removes the cross that hangs around it

"..."
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen takes your hand in her own and places it within your tiny palm

"Given he started ta catch them tatties on tha' pitchfork halfway through, Ah think it's a safe

bet he wuzn

Cassie-May O'Brien:

". . ."
Said Crystal

all tha' angry 'bout it."Cassie-May O'Brien:

"I c-can't-- you-- we--"
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien looked at Rockett.

"Know that no matter what happens to me...or wherever God needs me to go, know that I am

watching over you."

Whitney G. Elieen:

bloody murder at yew 'bout bein' an adult."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"I make...for a poor angel. Believe it or not I am not tall enough."
Said Whitney

"An' try bein' mad, Ah dare yew."
Said Cassie-May

"But I can try."
Said Whitney

"So long as I live your pain will be shouldered by me. No matter how much it hurts. No matter how it pains me."

"..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob looks Cassie up and down.

"...Ah can see it."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob struggles to keep a straight face.

"Ah got lotta freckles, sugercube."
Said Cassie-May

"In places."

"...Then... I should promise the same!"
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen chuckles

"It would not... be fair."
Said Crystal

"To abandon everything onto you."

"Oh my child..."
Said Whitney

"We will share the burdens."
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien smiled. That didn't last long, replaced by a wistful look on her face.

"...Then them bad times came an' Ah didn' got time ta think 'bout hanky-panky. Then...

Them wuz a few drunken adventures on th' road, but... Ah don't even remember their faces, let alone names."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"You had best be careful as well."
Said Whitney

"In fact I am counting on it."

"I will be careful... but I will not abandon you!"
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen speaks with a gentle voice. Gentle...yet firm.

"...I will do everything I can to help."
Said Crystal

"Bad times blown over by now, Ah hope," she notes, puffing on her cigar. "Ya look like a woman

who's got 'er act tagether. Not tha kind da bang an' blast."

Rockett Rimjob:

"You must promise me. Let this cross mark that promise."
Said Whitney

"...several things. Why."
Said Crystal

"Eeeyup. Ain' gotten any in... Fffuh, over a year now, Ah think. Didn' really wanna jus' fling

'round an' didn' meet any worthwhile hombres..."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Give your thumb a prick for me please"
Said Whitney

"Good on ya, then."
Said Rockett

"Comin' across someone worth stickin' with don't happen too often, Ah reckon."

"Rarer than a honest politician!"
Said Cassie-May

"...no shit."
Said Rockett

"Ah ain't met neither."

"See whut Ah mean?"
Said Cassie-May

"That Ah do."
Said Rockett

Crystal Saint Claire takes a small needle out of her bag.

"C-can you do it? I... do not like seeing my own blood..."
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen takes your hand in hers

"...An' whut options Ah got 'ere, too? Nephi's a kid. An' Alex's... nawt half bad lookin', but..."
Said Cassie-May

"Of course..."
Said Whitney

"Close your eyes."

Crystal Saint Claire closes her eyes, and takes a deep breath.

Whitney G. Elieen gives her thumb a little prick

Whitney G. Elieen:+07+04+01109

Whitney says a prayer that God may use her as his holy shield to defend those who need it most

Whitney G. Elieen flinches just a little

You however...feel nothingWhitney G. Elieen:

Just a pressure...but nothing.

"... you may need to press harder... the needle may be a little blunt."
Said Crystal

No pain. You don't even feel blood."Whitney G. Elieen:

"The needle is not blunt."

"...that sounds rather ominous."
Said Crystal

"Should I keep my eyes shut?"

"Yer actin' like those two are tha only two folks on tha continent worth yer time."
Said Rockett

"You realize we're about ta head to a whole new town fulla new faces, right?"

"...actually you probly shouldn't be takin' advice like this from a gal like me, now that Ah think about it."

"Open them child"
Said Whitney

"..."
Said Crystal

"You are perfectly fine"
Said Whitney

"An' if Ah understand mah job description, Ah'm gunna be travellin' a lot."
Said Cassie-May

Crystal Saint Claire looks.

"AhCassie-May O'Brien:

Your hand...is fine!Whitney G. Elieen:

Whitney's though...

woulda rather have mah grab wit' meh where Ah go."Cassie-May O'Brien:

Crystal Saint Claire immediately digs in her bag for something to bind the tiny stab wound with.

"Relax...it will be fine."
Said Whitney

"I heal very easily"

Crystal Saint Claire has already torn a piece of her shirt off to make a tourniquet.

"..."Crystal Saint Claire:0

"Crystal! You didn't need to do that..."
Said Whitney

"Well, if you can convince some poor bastard ta tag along..."
Said Rockett

"It is only a prick."
Said Whitney

"...there is a chance of infection..."
Said Crystal

"Like I said. I heal very easily"
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen smiles

"Come with me back to the bar? We need a little cup of whiskey."
Said Crystal

"I have become accustomed to taking on the pains of others...you see now what I mean."
Said Whitney

"...then Ah woulda rather take summun' tha' can keep up."
Said Cassie-May

"You just got over a bout of illness. Your immune system is tired."
Said Crystal

"And so...you will be careful yes?"
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen picks herself up and you along with her

"Also I do not know if that needle has poked any of my samples."
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen sets you carefully down.

"Keep up?"
Said Rockett

"So if you would not mind going to the bar, so I could get some alcohol to clean the

Crystal Saint Claire:

"You would not have poked yourself with a dirty needle."
Said Whitney

"But very well."

"Summun' tha' coulda watch my back, nawt summun' ta save every five minutes."
Said Cassie-May

"The likelihood of contamination had not occured to me until after the poking had occurred."
Said Crystal

"But you will be careful, yes?"
Said Whitney

"...I will."
Said Crystal

"My child...please."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen looks at you, her face suddenly very stern.

Crystal Saint Claire freezes like a deer in the headlights.

"That'd be ahdeal, yeah."
Said Rockett

"...Knew a few 'f those 'til recently."

"You woulda liked Jones, Ah think."

Rockett Rimjob puffs idly, staring at the glowing tip of her cigar.

"...Gimme a puff o' that."
Said Cassie-May

"Keep my cross...as a momento of my promise to you. And keep it as a reminder that the

needle that runs through your skin...runs through mine."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Y-yes ma'am."
Said Crystal

"Stand-up fella. Ballsy, too. Maybe not tha best at puttin' two-an'-two tagether, but he was

always real good at keepin' himself outta harms way. An' when it happened... well, he got out of it real fast."

Rockett Rimjob:

Crystal Saint Claire looks down at the cross in her hand.

Rockett Rimjob holds the cigar out to Cassie.

"...This almost covers my whole hand."
Said Crystal

"I have not wandered the wilderness for five years to lose a friend."
Said Whitney

"If you had a house i would suggest hanging it on the wall. I...forgot our difference in size for the moment."

"It has become obvious to me... I can deny it no longer..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire looks around.

"I am small."
Said Crystal

"...and I am large."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen says, standing as tall as she could

Cassie-May O'Brien took the cigar and puffed it a few times before returning.

"We're gunna figger out who an' why bought him a farm an' put 'em to justice."
Said Cassie-May

"...sure hope so."
Said Rockett

"Ah've never had such a hard time trackin' down someone before. Usually someone's got loose lips, if you loosen

yers. But..."

"...Ah'm gettin' nothin'."

"At all."

Whitney G. Elieen reaches her hand out

Whitney G. Elieen grasps yours

"It's... frustratin'."
Said Rockett

"Together, we form..."
Said Crystal

"A woman of average size!"

"Nothin' at all? Doc's th' only lead?"
Said Cassie-May

Whitney G. Elieen grabs you suddenly

Whitney G. Elieen places you right on her shoulders

"Or would it be a slightly smaller version of you--eeeeep!"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire holds on to Whitney for dear life.

"Now you see the world as I see it Child."
Said Whitney

"Ah've tried every bandit, ev'ry prisoner, an' ev'ry bastard that looks like a criminal willin' ta get

their whistle wet with me."

Rockett Rimjob:

"Doc's tha last lead Ah got, really."

"Tell me...what do you see?"
Said Whitney

"How do you enjoy the view?"

"Hrmm."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire looks down at Whitney.

"It is beautiful."
Said Crystal

Rockett Rimjob sighs, shaking her head and blowing a few more clouds of smoke.

Whitney G. Elieen looks up at you

"Also I feel like I might get hit by a passing crow may I come down please?"
Said Crystal

"If you pretend real hard...you can almost tell yourself you are flying."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen says as she begins to walk

"Like a fuckin' ghost, 'cept he didn't have tha common God-damn courtesy of stickin' around an'

hauntin' for a spell."

Rockett Rimjob:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has returned

"There must be a shop around here that is open..."
Said Whitney

Where isNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Everyone at

"...Ghost, huh..."
Said Cassie-May

Rockett and Cass are outside on the dirt roadRockett Rimjob:

Whitney and Crystal are on their way backWhitney G. Elieen:

"...Got th' weirdest nightmare lately."
Said Cassie-May

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is spotted leaving the post office!

"...yeah?"
Said Rockett

"Hmmmm...did I already give you a sweet this week...?"
Said Whitney

"Too much candy will rot the teeth. But every once and awhile...~"

"Ah wuz sum' smokin' corpse investigatin' a dead corpse. Got some mad contraption buried

in his eye, th' dead guy."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"I can get you something, too!"
Said Crystal

"...contraption."
Said Rockett

"Ah! The son of Joseph is on the prowel...shall we join him?"
Said Whitney

"We can all use a treat I think."

"Sure!"
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen says as he waves Nephi over, Crystal still on her shoulders

"...Eeeyup. Reachin' all th' way up ta th' brain. An' when Ah tried shootin' it, th' body Ah wuz

in said he doesn' remember doin' tha' and Ah woke up."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"...weird..."
Said Rockett

"What would you get me I can not have candy. But..."
Said Whitney

Rockett Rimjob holds the cigar out to Cass.

"Do you think God would forgive me if I treat myself out?~"
Said Whitney

"I think as long as your remain within the rules you have remained within, things will be

Crystal Saint Claire:

"...I could get you a hat."

Cassie-May O'Brien takes it and takes a few puffs.

"No dairy please. No animal products...a hat sounds lovely!"
Said Whitney

"Maybe a bonnet?"

"...Ah always got awful nightmares but tha' un' wuz diff'rent."
Said Cassie-May

"Something to wear for next saturday's prayer meeting..."
Said Whitney

"...weird."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob looks up at the sky.

"...Whut's weird?"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien returns the cigar.

"That dream. Dreams in general."
Said Rockett

"I was thinking something good for keeping the sun out of your eyes."
Said Crystal

"Ain't had night terrors since Ah booked it from home, though. Countin' mah blessin's."
Said Rockett

"You are very tall. You cannot take shade under mailboxes like I can."
Said Crystal

"Lucky gal."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien rubbed her face.

"Hmmmm..."
Said Whitney

"You are right...the sun is so harsh upon the eyes"

"...Ah always got ;em. Ever since tha' darn indian shaman."
Said Cassie-May

"You get hexed?" she asks, looking at Cass with a raised brow.Rockett Rimjob:

"Fuck if Ah know. Ain' no ordinary hex, Ah think."
Said Cassie-May

"If you would do so child, I would be ever so grateful."
Said Whitney

"Natives are..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob grasps at her forehead, lifting her hair.

"...they can either be tha best folks you'll ever meet or tha absolute worst."
Said Rockett

"Usually depends on how much money an' drugs they got."

"When I was younger I always wanted a pretty dress...not that I am saying you should!"
Said Whitney

"Nothing ever fit me, so mother had to make one for me."

"Dunnaw. Met mostly bad ones, Ah think."
Said Cassie-May

"...Well. We ever wind up on tha Sioux reservation, Ah'll be sure ta scrub up yer reputation."
Said Rockett

"Tha's a promise. Speakin' of... Ah think Ah oughta go grab a few hours o' sleep."
Said Cassie-May

"I would just need to get my hands on the fabric... And the patterns..."
Said Crystal

"Dd you not get the exact measurements before?~"
Said Whitney

"I do have the measurements."
Said Crystal

"I lack the fabric."

"A dress is different then a vest of armor...though i appreciate it all the same."
Said Whitney

"Might be good."
Said Rockett

"Ah'm gonna hang out here for a while, finish this cigar."

"Perhaps one of these days i shall get you fabric?"
Said Whitney

"And... the shapes I would have to cut the fabric into in order to create a dress, rather than

an abomination."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"You get some good shut-eye, hun."
Said Rockett

"Ah'd really prefer nawt to."
Said Cassie-May

"Ah said good shut-eye."
Said Rockett

AckNephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Ain' possible."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien smiled at Rockett and walked away to grab some sleep.

"G'night, darlin'."
Said Rockett

Nephi "Longiron" Delano catches up to Crystal and Whitney, clearly something on his mind.

"Hmmmm..."
Said Whitney

"Something tells me it will be a much different dress then what my mother would make..."

Whitney G. Elieen looks over to the approaching Nephi

"Yer free ta wake meh up wit' coffee an' breakfast in bed!"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien said, not turning, and walked away.

Crystal Saint Claire is on Whitney's shoulders!

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is looking down at the ground and occasionally mumbling something.

"Ah. Nephi. Welcome."
Said Whitney

"Hello, Delano!"
Said Crystal

"...does something trouble you child?"
Said Whitney

"...Just got done mailin a letter."
Said Nephi

Goodnight Varm!Whitney G. Elieen:

"...a letter?"

"That is good, is it not?"
Said Crystal

"It's probably nuthin. Just a worrywart, I guess."
Said Nephi

"..."
Said Crystal

"IF it makes you feel any better, I have also done something stressful, and it worked out..."
Said Crystal

"...you will be in my prayers son of Joseph."
Said Whitney

"Not stressful on my part."
Said Nephi

Crystal Saint Claire is wearing Whitney's cross around her neck.

"...There wasn't any mail waitin for me, and I said I'd be here in my last letter."
Said Nephi

"...My brother Alma, he's working with the Union railroad crews."

"...did you mention he was in dodge?"
Said Whitney

"...They got a... Really high rate o'dyin."
Said Nephi

"Perhaps the Union Railroad crews are having issues with mail..?"
Said Crystal

"He might be."
Said Nephi

"And that's what I'm worried about. It could just be the usual mail gremlins, y'know...":

"Or something happened."

"Do you know where he would be in dodge?"
Said Whitney

"Probably wherever you find the boys in blue crashing for the night."
Said Nephi

"...Just feels weird. First time in a long time he hasn't written me back."

"Well... maybe we can send the Union Railroad office a letter asking about the well-being of

your brother?"

Crystal Saint Claire:

"I get a... Lotta mail."
Said Nephi

"We should go. To check up on him."
Said Whitney

"Tell them you are concerned, as he usually writes you back..."
Said Crystal

"I will. Still, got mail from some of the others though."
Said Nephi

"Though he shall be in my prayers, I feel you need more than just a comforting message to

the all mighty to sooth your mind."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Mail from others?"

"Who are the others?"
Said Crystal

"Moroni is still on his mission, Helaman wouldn't write me if..."
Said Nephi

"Your ssiblings?"
Said Crystal

"...Do you have pictures?"

"Isshy sent some sketches..."
Said Nephi

"You should get pictures."
Said Crystal

"Yeah. Whole big family picture."
Said Nephi

Whitney G. Elieen smiles faintly

Nephi "Longiron" Delano fishes through a pouch on his belt, and pulls out a big picture featuring a...

Ohhoh. Oh wow. Is that Nephi, there, with the oversized hat, horribly fitting clothes, and buckteeth?

""..."
Said Crystal

"Crystal...would you mind if i let you down a seco-"
Said Whitney

"Dental corrective processes are amazing."
Said Crystal

"...I just grew into em, shaddup!"
Said Nephi

"...you look...God's above you look..."
Said Whitney

"Did you grow into the hat as well?"
Said Crystal

GodWhitney G. Elieen:

The picture is clearly several years old. Four boys, four girls.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"...is that the same hat you're wearing now?"
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen picks Crystal up from her shoulders and places her down on the ground

Crystal Saint Claire stands there.

"Nephi if you do not mind watching Crystal for a moment?"
Said Whitney

"..."
Said Crystal

"Is something wrong?"

Two parents, it seems. One of them is wearing a mystery substance-stained once-

white lab coat, and the other looks every bit... Like Cassie, almost. but quite a bit older. Trail-worn and hard, but

better rested.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"No. Everything is fine." She says with the biggest, most awkward grin on her otherwise pretty

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Yeah sure.Nephi "
Said Longiron

"And yeah, it is."

"You only say it like that when things are not fine"
Said Crystal

"Alma's hat. He's the oldest."
Said Nephi

"I am worried now."
Said Crystal

"Pa gave it to him, he gave it to me when he went to work with the railroad."
Said Nephi

"I just...need a walk is all. A little time alone to pray."
Said Whitney

"I promise I will be back right quick"

"Okay!"
Said Crystal

"And we can go to the store together."
Said Whitney

"Alma's that one. The guy the size of Whitney."
Said Nephi

Whitney G. Elieen gives Crystal a hug

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has completely lost track of the other two and is just reminiscing.

Crystal Saint Claire returns the hug without her usual hesitation.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is using that same voice that parents use when talking about their kids.

"I will be back in a moment...do keep an eye on her."
Said Whitney

"So... you said I reminded you of one of our sisters..."
Said Crystal

"Yeah, yeah. Nothing's gonna happen."
Said Nephi

"Good."
Said Whitney

"Oh yeah, Ishmael. She's the little one trying to hide behind Alma."
Said Nephi

"I will just be a moment..."
Said Whitney

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire leans closer to Nephi.

"The one with the big scar on her head."
Said Nephi

"..."
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen steps out and walks off

"She's real self-conscious about it."
Said Nephi

"How did she get the scar?"
Said Crystal

"...did she hit her head..?"

"...Shooting accident."
Said Nephi

"...oh, dear."
Said Crystal

"It is fortunate she was not permanently damaged..."

"Ma insisted we all learn how to shoot, in case the Mormon Hunters came round

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Wait."
Said Crystal

"The what"

lolololoRockett Rimjob:

"Ma didn't say. She just said there were bad folks that would want to hunt us."
Said Nephi

"So everyone in my family learned how to shoot rifles from the time we were big enough to hold em."

"...and your mother was worried they would come BACK."
Said Crystal

"So... that means they had been there before?"

"Who hunts mormons!?"

"That's like... I don't know, hunting crows!"

"Y'think I asked? She's a tough lady who doesn't take any lip."
Said Nephi

"There's not much benefit to hunting them..."
Said Crystal

"Back when the church was founded, there was a lot of killings."
Said Nephi

"And exterminating them just isn't going to happen."
Said Crystal

"Governor of Missouri signed an order that every mormon would be put to death."
Said Nephi

"That... sounds..."
Said Crystal

"Which is why everybody left. And why I will never go to Missouri. Ever."
Said Nephi

"I am trying to come up with a word stronger than 'abomination' "
Said Crystal

"Why you think they all ran off to Deseret?"
Said Nephi

"In the middle of nowhere, real bad territory, filled with rattlers and lord knows what else."

"Why Missouri?"
Said Crystal

"S'where most of the church was situated."
Said Nephi

"When the mobs killed the prophet and shot most of the rest of the leadership, it became clear pretty quick that

stayin there wasn't the best idea."

"This was AFTER they all got kicked out of New York and everywhere else."

"Worrisome."
Said Crystal

"Long and the short is, there's a reason the Legion is one of the best trained and

armed forces in the whole world."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"The soldiers that defend Deseret."
Said Nephi

"Something like a... Standing army, I guess?"

"A miltia"

"The thing where... It's like, fairy tale stuff?"

"Am I being unclear?"

"...Crystal, we're going to need ta'have a talk about fibbin."

"She and Whitney are siblings."

"That's why Miss Rockett almost shot her this afternoon."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"...did... you not know this? I was under the impression I as the last of us to learn this."
Said Crystal

"When Whitney gets back, you can ask her."

Crystal Saint Claire looks around again...

"How long has it been?"
Said Crystal

Nephi "Longiron" Delano checks his watch.,

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has a nice silver pocketwatch on a chain to his shirt pocket.

"...so sorry."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen says as she walks back onto the scene

"...My watch needs to be wound."
Said Nephi

"Whitney!"
Said Crystal

"Hello again~"
Said Whitney

Crystal Saint Claire almost skips over to her

"...So. Hey whitney."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has a curious look on her face.

DARK SECRETCrystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire sits there.

Crystal Saint Claire yawns...

"Of course...what is it?"
Said Whitney

"...Y'got anything you ah, wanna say?"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano gives her a look.

"About what?"
Said Whitney

"Bout "
Said miss

"...Is she married? Should I be saying Mizz?"
Said Crystal

"..."
Said Whitney

"What of her?"

"Are you, perhaps, curious about our relation?"

"MMhmm."
Said Nephi

"Crystal spilled the beans."

"There were no beans to spill! You were the only one who didn't know!"
Said Crystal

"Well how wuz I supposta know that?"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano huffs.

"Figger that'd be something you share right away!"
Said Nephi

"It's a little newsworthy, really."

"It is fine...I am an open book. It just so happens that that was a very dark and sad chapter of

Whitney G. Elieen:

"I think my book is missing pages."
Said Crystal

"She is my sister, yes. After the great disappointment, our father turned vengeful and cruel."
Said Whitney

Crystal Saint Claire dangles her legs off Whitney's shoulders...

"He beat us both though eventually I found the "secret" to stop him. I was foolish. Childish. My

sister came to me for support. I tried to help. But it only pushed her away...and left me with this."

Whitney G. Elieen:

Whitney G. Elieen pulls her hair aside to show the scar on her scalp

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire inspects it a little more closely.

"That looks like it must have hurt..."
Said Crystal

"It put me in a coma for two weeks."
Said Whitney

"...How... are you not..."
Said Crystal

"Was there anyone taking care of you?"

"When I awoke...I feel you know the rest of this story."
Said Whitney

"I do not know."

"I do, but... Someone had to have been..."
Said Crystal

"All I know is of my vision...and when I awoke I was alone."
Said Whitney

"...Yeah."
Said Nephi

"The human body can survive... for some time without food, but without water, two weeks

would be a death sentence..."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"...Hey, Whitney?"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks down, at the ground.

"...yes?"
Said Whitney

Nephi "Longiron" Delano doesn't meet her gaze at all.

"Faith's a real powerful thing, y'know?"
Said Nephi

"Don't you go losin it, no matter what you see."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano turns and walks away.

"Why is everyone saying ominous things today"
Said Crystal

"...God bless you son of Joseph."
Said Whitney

"Y'cannie jes' walk away after sayin' sumthin loik that! Ge' back 'ear an giv' us a prop'r

Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire manages to bite the rest of her accented rant off.

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire collapses a little onto Whitney.

"I am tired..."
Said Crystal

"I... may have forgotten to sleep last night. There was a nap... at the restaurant... But I do not remember how long

ago that was..."

"...it is rather late. Tomorrow we need to be up bright and early. Would you care to have your

treat tomorrow?"

Whitney G. Elieen:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has already headed back towards their accomodations, but not before

mumbling one last thing, that is barely audible, nearly swallowed up by the wind...

"Ivory rider..."
Said Nephi

Crystal Saint Claire nods sleepily, then says "Yes..." realizing Whitney cannot see her nod.

"..."
Said Crystal

"We met him..."

Crystal Saint Claire trails off, holding onto Whitney, but almost falling.

Crystal Saint Claire is BUSHED.

Good night, all! I gotta go to bed...Crystal Saint Claire:

Yes goodnightNephi "Longiron" Delano:

For me as well.

Mitchell worked. With the lack of the proprietor, there must be a need for someone with healing expertise, and

Whitney does serve the Great Physician.

The door opens with a creak and she can see a few individuals laid out on beds. There is no nurse present, but

the injured appear to have been given basic care.

They all need more than that.

Whitney G. Elieen makes her way inside, step after thunderous step. Frowning in pure and utter concern

for those in need.

"Hello all of you...who is the caretaker? I had heard the doctor had taken off."
Said Whitney

Several of them stop moving when they hear Whitney's voice. She can see one with

no leg and bandages covering his head. There is another next to him with a heavily wrapped torso. Both push

themselves away from Whitney as they realize who she is, muttering fearfully as they do.

(It is quite alright)Whitney G. Elieen:

"You do not need to be frightened..." She speaks, in her ever soft and soothing voice. "I have come to provide

whatever comfort and aid I can give that is within my power to give you."

kkWhitney G. Elieen:000000000

What am I miss

Crystal Saint Claire notices the injured noticing Whitney.

Crystal Saint Claire approaches. "Hello. My name is Dr. Crystal Saint-Claire. Today, I will be doing what I

can to assist in your care."

"Which is somethin' ah cannie do if y'keep cowerin' at th' sight of my assistant."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire gives her best Dr.House-type... look.

You know the one, where it's pretty clear she's calling them pussiesCrystal Saint Claire:

"...be gentle with them Doctor Saint-Claire."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen gives ticks

Music on?

...is this from ATLA?

Crystal Saint Claire sighs.

"No...no...please...I..."
Said The

"Shhhh..."
Said She

"I will not tell any of you that you will make a full recovery."
Said Crystal

"From there, progress can be made."

The man on the adjacent bed lifts a gun and lines the barrel up with Crystal's chest.Bandit Leadslinger:

"..."
Said Whitney

"I would rather you not.."
Said Crystal

He pulls the hammer back.Bandit Leadslinger:

Whitney G. Elieen:+05+01+0504

Whitney says a prayer that God may use her as his holy shield to defend those who need it most0

Whitney G. Elieen reaches her hand forward

Crystal Saint Claire looks him in the eye.

The hammer falls forward.Bandit Leadslinger:

It clicks.

He keeps pulling the hammer back and depressing the trigger. There is no bang, only whimpering clicks from the

empty gun.

"..."
Said Crystal

"...I am not here to hurt you. I am not here to preach to you..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen places her hand on his stump of a leg and closes her eyes

"Whitney, the gun's pointed at me, I think I may have to..."
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen takes a deep breath...and makes a silent prayer

Crystal Saint Claire shudders.

"Talk... with.. him..."
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen:+05+04+0601

Whitney places her hand upon the wound and closes her eyes shut...saying a silent prayer that God may deliver

them from their wounds

Crystal Saint Claire takes a deep breath.

"I am only here for... if any of you refuse her care."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire does not move to take the gun.

"I can keep your wounds from becoming infected..."
Said Crystal

"If they are not already. If they are, I can clean them out, to the best of my abilities."

"I will not do anything you do not expressly permit me to do."

Bandit Leadslinger breathes in a tight breath, but relaxes after a moment.

"Crystal. Silence." She says, her voice restrained. Like she was holding in the urge to scream.Whitney G. Elieen:

"I--"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire immediately silences.

Crystal Saint Claire immediately turns to Whitney

Bandit Leadslinger takes a shuddering breath.

"What did you do?"
Said Bandit

"..."
Said Crystal

"She likely just healed whatever of your wounds she could bear feeling inflicted upon herself. Actually, probably

few more than that."

Whitney G. Elieen slowly removes her hand from the once maimed leg. Her body shivering and

shuddering in pain as it takes on form and life again.

There is pain Whitney, and there is hell. Hell is your left leg. The pain does not

subside as normal. It continues. The bandages on the man's leg move slow, almost imperceptible. There is

Whitney G. Elieen reaches her hand forward to the injury on his head. Her hands trembling. A terrible fury

burning within her left leg. Fighting back every urge to cry out in pain.

Whitney G. Elieen places her hand upon his head injury and closes her eyes shut. Tight.

With a shuddering gasp...Whitney G. Elieen:

Whitney places her hand upon the wound and closes her eyes shut...saying a silent prayer that God may deliver

them from their wounds

"Whitney don't"
Said Crystal

"...let. Me....work."
Said Whitney

Crystal Saint Claire has gotten a lot less doctor-y and a lot more... terrified.

Crystal Saint Claire takes a breath...

Crystal Saint Claire turns to the bandit pointing a gu at her.

"So."
Said Crystal

"While they are working... What is your issue today?"

The pain is raised by an order of magnitude. It spreads across your body. It is an effort

to keep your mind afloat in the sea of searing sensation cauterizing your brain towards unconsciousness.

Vigor roll.

"Because if she has to take any more of this than is absolutely necessary, I will not be able

to forgive myself for... a considerable amount of time."

Crystal Saint Claire:

...oh.Crystal Saint Claire:

The man gestures to his bandage laden midsection. "Gut's fucked. Blood and shit

Bandit Leadslinger:

Whitney, it's too much.

"That is unfortunate... I can try to clean it out..."
Said Crystal

"But it might hurt."

The mercy of dreamless sleep comes as your mind shuts down. The man who

Whitney touched has gained most of a new leg and his head seems in proper shape again. He should be well in

an hour. The same may not be true for Whitney.

With a final scream she falls to the side. Her body shaking and shivering, even now, in this

state of blissful oblivion...

Whitney G. Elieen:

Crystal Saint Claire rushes to Whitney's side...

The broken men on the bed watch as Whitney falls into a twitching pile of limbs.Bandit Leadslinger:

Whitney G. Elieen feels nothing...at least for the moment. Perhaps God has granted her temporary

reprieve from the terrible pain she took upon herself...

"..."
Said Bandit

"Get her outta here."

"To decent bed."

"We'll be fine."

Whitney G. Elieen is still and lifeless...

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire tries to drag her

...Whitney G. Elieen:

oh dear...

...Crystal Saint Claire:

Gimme twenty minutes to get settled

kkWhitney G. Elieen:

I will be right back myself

i need a milkshake

okCrystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire is trying to drag someone easily thrice her weight. It's... pretty clearly not happening.

As such, there's really only one option available to her.Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire takes a deep breath

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire screams as loud as she can.

(D'you think it'd carry to the others from here?)Crystal Saint Claire:

Perhaps she should go and get help!

But that is just my OCC suggestion. Whitney is out like a rock I fear...

Healed Bandit pushes himself out of the bed. He peers at his unfamiliar leg as it makes the rapid and

unnatural recovery that should be impossible. He swings himself off the bed and tests the new leg. It

holds his weight.

She's screaming for help.Crystal Saint Claire:

Something along the lines of

Healed Bandit takes a second to find his balance with the footless leg, then walks over to Whitney.

"SOMEBODY HELP"
Said Crystal

"...here."
Said Healed

"Help me get her upright."

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire tries

"I am... very, very weak."
Said Crystal

"Can you... walk?"

Healed Bandit pulls a crutch off the bed and jams one end of it under his right arm. He bends down with

as much as he can and grabs the back of Whitney's dress.

(To GM) rolling 3d6!!Healed Bandit:000

Crystal Saint Claire tries to help get Whitney up...

Crystal Saint Claire:+02

Healed Bandit manages to leverage enough strength to yank Whitney up. He drapes one arm of hers

across his shoulders and pulls her to his side.

"...Where... do we..."
Said Crystal

"The inn."

"...Or the general store. Mr. Bean can help."

Healed Bandit gets Whitney situated to where he can move her.

"Go."
Said Healed

Healed Bandit nods to himself.

"..Do you know how to get there?"
Said Crystal

"Follow."
Said Healed

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire starts walking.

Crystal Saint Claire has to stop a few times, to get her bearings...

Any rolls?Crystal Saint Claire:

To get there?

Healed Bandit makes his slow way in the wake of Crystal's path. Leaning on the crutch as he swings

himself and Whitney forward, putting weight on his good leg, and going through the action again.

(narp)Healed Bandit:

When they do arrive... Is anyone there?Crystal Saint Claire:

(Arrive to which spot?Healed Bandit:

(The General Store.)Crystal Saint Claire:

Right.Healed Bandit:

"...Whitney..."Crystal Saint Claire:0

Crystal Saint Claire is holding back tears.

It takes a half hour for the party to get to the General store with the pace they must

The owner, Mister Bean, is sitting in his chair when Crystal first sees him.

Crystal Saint Claire sprints towards him.

He has the door open for them when he sees the man struggling along with Whitney.

"What's going on?"
Said General

Crystal Saint Claire almost immediately starts blurting out an almost indecipherable description of the

Crystal Saint Claire:

General Store Owner keeps his eyes locked on Crystal as she explains matters. His eyes do not widen

and his brows do not raise. He does look up near the tail end of the explanation to look at Whitney and the

man with the peculiar pristine foot.

"Wait."
Said General

"Be back."

Crystal Saint Claire just nods.

General Store Owner creaks off on the floorboards of the general store towards the back end and grabs

an unlabeled jar from a shelf whose contents do not appear to be for sale.

Crystal Saint Claire then slowly sits on the ground... tucks her knees to her chest... and starts crying like

the little girl she is.

General Store Owner catches sight of Crystal on his way back and makes a slight detour. Bean is back

moments later.

"Here."
Said General

General Store Owner he presses a long stick wrapped in crinkling paper into Crystal's hands.

"Make you feel better."
Said General

"..."
Said Crystal

General Store Owner walks over to Whitney.

Crystal Saint Claire reflexively receives it.

Healed Bandit stands as still as he can in the presence of Mr. Bean.

General Store Owner unscrews the lid on the jar. There is a slight pop, and the smell becomes evident to

the entire room.

Guts roll.General Store Owner:

(To GM) rolling 3d6!!

General Store Owner:

Healed Bandit crinkles his nose at the smell, but does little else.

Holy mother of GOD Crystal that is the foulest shit you have ever smelled.

You don't puke.

But it is close.

General Store Owner holds the jar under Whitney's nose.

Whitney G. Elieen:

Whitney comes back to consciousness with her beatific smile looking only slightly

"..."
Said Whitney

General Store Owner puts the lid back on the jar.

Whitney G. Elieen opens her eyes slowly...

Crystal Saint Claire is still sobbing, curled up a few feet away.

Whitney G. Elieen tries her best to pull herself up

Whitney G. Elieen stumbles up onto her feet...almost falling as she puts weight upon her left foot

"...where am I?"
Said Whitney

Crystal Saint Claire almost TACKLES Whitney, still sobbing incoherently.000000

Whitney G. Elieen places a hand up to her head and rubs...doing her best to smile through the still

considerable pain

General Store Owner leaves Crystal and the former bandit to take care of things as he replaces the jar.

"..!"
Said Whitney

Healed Bandit immediately loses balance and topples to the floor.

"..."
Said Whitney

"Is everything alright...?"

Whitney G. Elieen says as she strokes at Crystal's hair

"Shhh shhhh..."
Said Whitney

Crystal Saint Claire is alternating between crying gibberish and futile pummeling.

"Your leg will be stiff and sore for a time..."
Said Whitney

"Be careful. Do not strain yourself."

"N'iff y'ever overexten yerself loik tha' again oi sware oi'll- oi'll"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire goes back into crying.

Whitney G. Elieen makes her way over, limping as she does

"Right."
Said Healed

Crystal Saint Claire is still attached to Whitney

"I'll...be careful."
Said Healed

"..your friend?"
Said Whitney

"What was the matter with him?"

"Who?"
Said Healed

"The other."
Said Whitney

"There were bandages over his chest..."

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire holds onto Whitney REALLY TIGHT

"Abd-dominal wound."
Said Crystal

"P-please... don't... right now..."

Whitney G. Elieen closes her eyes

"..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen takes a deep breath

"...my work is not done."
Said Whitney

"I c-can..."
Said Crystal

Healed Bandit pushes himself up to a sitting position.

"I c-can help him... t-to give you time... to get b-better..."
Said Crystal

"He'll be fine."
Said Healed

"Said so."

"He weren't lying."

"Nurse'll take care of him."

"...are you certain?"
Said Whitney

"I can heal him..."

"No need."
Said Healed

Whitney G. Elieen takes another step forward, almost stumbling again as she does

"...I told you I would not preach to you. But remember what had happened...and put this to

good use."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"I will pray for you both..."

Whitney G. Elieen looks down at Crystal.

Crystal Saint Claire has her face buried in Whitney's dress, and is still trembling...

"Thank you for bringing me here." She looks over to the store owner. "And thank you for

reviving me..."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"please..."
Said Crystal

"d-don't go..."

"Child...I am not going anywhere."
Said Whitney

"Don't mention it."
Said Healed

General Store Owner leans against one of the shelves of the store.

Whitney G. Elieen squeezes you with a noticeably weaker grip

"Welcome."
Said General

"Both of you. All three of you. God bless..."
Said Whitney

"You... sh-should rest."
Said Crystal

"Shall we go back to the inn then?"
Said Whitney

"I feel the need to...sit..."

Whitney G. Elieen said with clear pain in her voice

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire nods.

"Do you have... crutches?"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire looks to Bean.

"There is no need..."
Said Whitney

"If you fall, I will not be able to pick you up."
Said Crystal

"I dare not take a crutch away from one who could truly use it..."
Said Whitney

"We can borrow them."
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen said as she limps her way to the door

"I...don't think I need this one."
Said Healed

"..."
Said Whitney

Healed Bandit slides the crutch he used on the way over to Whitney. He gets up from the floor, a little

Whitney G. Elieen slowly lowers herself down and grabs the crutch

"God bless you sir..."
Said Whitney

"..."
Said Healed

"Seems to have done that already."

"What is your name sir?"
Said Whitney

"If you do not mind me asking..."

"Jon."
Said Healed

"You will be in my prayers Jon."
Said Whitney

"Thanks."
Said Healed

"Keep the others in there too."

"I promise..."
Said Whitney

"Now come along Crystal."

"Rest with me."

Whitney G. Elieen hobbles her way over to the door, as slowly as she can.

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire accompanies her, not letting go for a moment.

Healed Bandit stays standing for a moment, lost in thought. He heads out of the door in the direction

opposite Crystal and Whitney two minutes later.

I think from here...we can take this to discord. Would this count as a conversion Doc? There

are special mechanics for that.

Whitney G. Elieen:

we can always talk that over with neb later

I thnk so tooCrystal Saint Claire:

Yes.Healed Bandit:

It does.

A confused and hesitant one, but a conversion.

Score one for Team God

"So tha clinic."
Said Rockett

Said Cassie-May

"Worst case scenario."
Said Alexander

"How long ago was this?"

Alexander Hauswald points at Sacks.

"Sacks could probably sniff him out."
Said Alexander

"...Ah guess. Sawrry, sugercubes, them nightmares were... _bad_ tonight. Ah'm still kinda

outta it."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Couple months ago."
Said Rockett

Alexander Hauswald looks at Cassie. Worried?

Rockett Rimjob pats Cass on the back.

"...He might be able to."
Said Alexander

"He a good sniffer?"
Said Rockett

"He might be part hound."
Said Alexander

Sacks looks at Alexander, unamused.

"Then again, not sure he's entirely dog, either."
Said Alexander

Cassie-May O'Brien pulls her hat off for a moment to smack herself a few times.

"...Ah need anuth'r coffee."
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimjob scratches behind Sacks' ears.

Sacks wags his tail at the pretty lady giving him scritchies.

"...I think I can help with that."
Said Alexander

"Ah'll be sure ta grab some extra grounds case you run out, with that habit of yers."
Said Rockett

"Ah got like twelve pounds of coffee in mah backpack."

"I need water and I'll fix you something."

"So what, that'll last you about three days?"
Said Rockett

(Where are we, right now? Dodge, or..?)Crystal Saint Claire:

((the limbo of "no idea until Doc appears", Poage))Cassie-May O'Brien:

"...Mahbe four."

Rockett Rimjob chuckles a bit, shaking her head.

"I could try to make you some sort of... on-the-go brewer..."

"...Why?"
Said Alexander

"You need fire, a pot, and water."

"That's all."

"It's like pulp in orange juice. Some people dislike feeling the grounds between their teeth."
Said Crystal

"This is Cassie."
Said Alexander

"So? She deserves nice things..."
Said Crystal

"Ah bought a gold sieve real cheap ta try ta git them grounds out..."
Said Cassie-May

"A sieve?"
Said Crystal

"May I take a look?"

"Again."
Said Alexander

Rockett Rimjob 's ears perk up.

"I can help."
Said Alexander

"Sieve!"
Said Rockett

"That reminds me!"

Cassie-May O'Brien rummaged through her backpack and pulled out a large prospector's sieve used for

washing gold.

"Ah gotta run up ta Fargo 'fore tha winter rolls in..."
Said Rockett

"Do you need the whole thing? Or could you part with a piece of the screen?"
Said Crystal

"Ah jus' wanna sumthin' Ah coulda brew mah coffee wit'."
Said Cassie-May

'Tha's too large."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano walks up.

"...What're you folk on about?"
Said Nephi

"Cass."
Said Rockett

"You ever heard'a hockey?"

"A whuh?"
Said Cassie-May

"...What's hockey?"
Said Alexander

"Tha most goddamn fun you'll ever have on ice."
Said Rockett

"There's no ice here."
Said Alexander

"Fuck, y'all ain't never been north, have ya?"
Said Rockett

"I have."
Said Crystal

"No plans for it."
Said Alexander

"Define north."
Said Cassie-May

"I have a degree from MIT, is that far enough north?"
Said Crystal

"Anywhere Fargo an' upwards, about."
Said Rockett

"Philidelphia is north..."
Said Crystal

"Philly? Naw, they wouldn't have hockey there."
Said Rockett

"Isn't that part of indian territory, now?"
Said Nephi

"Naw, that's Bismarck."
Said Rockett

"All I know about philladelphia is that Thomas ain't there and that they think cheese in

steaks is a good idea."

Alexander Hauswald:

"...that's all ya really need ta know about Philly ta know you don't wanna stay there too often."
Said Rockett

"That is... innaccurate"
Said Crystal

"Even if tha money there's good Ah don't much like that place."
Said Rockett

"...I dislike it as well."
Said Crystal

"Whyzzat?"
Said Cassie-May

"Anyway Cass. You ever heard of pigskin?"
Said Rockett

"For different reasons."
Said Crystal

"Y'all mean tha' ball thing?"
Said Cassie-May

"Yeah. Tha sport."
Said Rockett

"Played 'round once ot twice."
Said Cassie-May

Sacks barks loudly at the mention of pigs and balls!

"Good. Y'ever heard'a golf?"
Said Rockett

"I did."
Said Alexander

"An' have ya ever heard'a boxing?"
Said Rockett

"Eeeyup."
Said Cassie-May

"Put those three tagether. Two teams, five players each."
Said Rockett

"Then slap ice skates on 'em an' put 'em in an ice rink."

"Sounds like a mess."
Said Alexander

"So... Yew got people tryin' ta score a goal wit' a pigskin smacked 'round wit' sticks while

boxin' each other?"

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"On ice?"

"Yes."
Said Rockett

"It's a royal mess but it's so damn fun."

"Tha' sounds like sumthin' y'all think up when real bored an' real drunk."
Said Cassie-May

"...well, it ain't a pigskin. It's closer to a rock."
Said Rockett

"Ain't much ta do there 'cept drink, fuck, an' freeze ta death."

"Yer puntin' a rock."
Said Cassie-May

"With sticks."
Said Rockett

"Tha' game sounds designed ta see how many amusin' injuries yew can git in a period o'

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Ah wanna see it."

"There's a reason hockey players ain't got much teeth left."
Said Rockett

"I believe we should focus on locating the doctor for now..."
Said Crystal

(I'm kind of running on the assumption we're in transit to Dodge.)Rockett Rimjob:

(same)Cassie-May O'Brien:

(same)Crystal Saint Claire:

"Kinda hard ta do that when we ain't even in Dodge yet."
Said Rockett

"If you start planning once you get there, it is time wasted. Why not hammer out some sort

of skeleton of a plan?"

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Step one, step two, et cetera."

"Step one. Go to tha clinic. If he ain't there, go to tha bar."
Said Rockett

"Why the bar?"
Said Crystal

"Also, Sacks could try sniffing him."
Said Alexander

"It's Doc Mitchell. Bastard whets his whistle jus' as much as he wets wounds."
Said Rockett

"I... um..."
Said Crystal

"This is just... a theory..."

"But if I was on the run from someone I thought might want me dead, and was trying to lay low..."

"I would not demonstrate any distinctive abilities."

"For example, if I were you, trying to blend in somewhere, I would either refrain from sex, or hide out in a brothel.

Hide a leaf in the woods, so to speak."

"Unless there are a lot of doctors in Dodge, word of a new doctor would spread quickly, reaching the ears of

people one would be trying to avoid... at least, I think..."

Crystal Saint Claire never looks up from her book.

"He don't seem like tha kinda guy ta squat, but you might got a point."
Said Rockett

"If he don't wanna be found, though, Ah ain't sure we could find 'em though."

"Ah guess we're gunna werry 'bout him in hidin' if we don't find him."
Said Cassie-May

"Why would he?"
Said Alexander

"The desperado was hunting lawmen, not doctors."

"...Yew got a point there."
Said Cassie-May

"He might not know that."
Said Rockett

"Because the exact thing that's currently happening might happen, no?"
Said Crystal

"Some new Marshals might decide to look into surviving witnesses. And they might find out something."

"Like what?"
Said Alexander

"His drinking problem?"

"His cult membership?"

"..."
Said Crystal

"I thought higher of you than this, Hauswald."

"You were an agent, no?"

"I don't think our lawman-killer thinks that far ahead."
Said Alexander

"Well if he's keen on hidin', Ah'll do some diggin'. Maybe lure 'em out."
Said Rockett

"So, if you do something you don't want anyone to see, and someone sees it"
Said Crystal

"What is the desired outcome?"

"You don't go killing someone in broad daylight as he goes to the doctor if you want

nobody to see it."

Alexander Hauswald:

"He was either very stupid or wanted people to know."

"He's done this before. Had a few other marshals go out like Jones did."
Said Rockett

"Whoever's doin' this has done it before."

"Somewhere where someone could see them?"
Said Alexander

"So why has there been no progress on the case?"
Said Crystal

"Because all the marshals are dead."
Said Alexander

"Sans us."
Said Cassie-May

"Here's hoping we're better than him."
Said Alexander

"Fossifer's not dead?"
Said Crystal

"He's the manager."
Said Alexander

"Could have posted a bounty for witnesses."
Said Crystal

"He doesn't go around solving crimes."
Said Alexander

"He appears to be hands-on enough to get us to him. Why not pick up some information for

us while he waited?"

Crystal Saint Claire:

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Alexander Hauswald shrugs.

"Anyone wants to bet Fossifer's our desperado?"
Said Alexander

"...Why'd he be?"
Said Cassie-May

"I don't know. It's like one of those penny dreadfuls teists."
Said Alexander

"Two hundred dollars says he's not."
Said Crystal

"Ah don't think any of us have that much."
Said Nephi

"One of us does~!"
Said Crystal

"...Huh."
Said Alexander

"She's loaded on dineros."
Said Cassie-May

"Hope they're in a bank somewhere."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano resists the urge to ask for a small loan of $1,000,000.

"..."
Said Crystal

"Yer lyin'."
Said Cassie-May

Crystal Saint Claire holds her bag a little closer

"How would you know? I beat you at poker!"
Said Crystal

"..."
Said Alexander

"...We're stopping at a bank

"An' Ah haven't yew go ta anythin' resemblin' a bank since then."
Said Cassie-May

"An' yer huggin' tha' bag awful close."

"Dodge city has a bank."
Said Nephi

Crystal Saint Claire:+01

"What no I'm not"

"...also banks get robbed all the time"

"She's got a point."
Said Nephi

"So do girls carrying absurd amounts of money."
Said Alexander

"..."
Said Crystal

Rockett Rimjob stays oddly quiet during this conversation.

Crystal Saint Claire mumbles something

"..."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has also been standing on the opposite side of the group to Rockett, putting as

many people as possible between the two in case she got any crazy ideas, like, kissin him or something.

Alexander Hauswald looks at Rockett.

"You too."
Said Alexander

"Why you eyeballin' me, Hauswald?"
Said Rockett

"Because you're dressed nicely and I get the feeling you also have cash on you."
Said Alexander

Whitney G. Elieen is silent in part herself. Eyes closed with an air of concentration about her.

"Money an' Ah are usually pretty fleetin'."
Said Rockett

"Don't stay with me too long. Gotta replace this get-up every few months 'r so, see."

"That an' Ah got a tough taste in cigars."

"...."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire scoots over towards Whitney.0

"...Hyuk, cigars."
Said Cassie-May

"Do you have money or not."
Said Alexander

"...Well that one guy slipped me a twenny."
Said Rockett

Crystal Saint Claire is practically sitting in Whitney's lap.

Whitney G. Elieen wraps her arms around crystal, though she does not open her eyes just yet.

"Careful child...my leg is still sore."
Said Whitney

Crystal Saint Claire is wearing Whitney's cross around her neck.

"...Just the twenty's alright."
Said Alexander

"An' Ah got a couple other tips. But Ah also restocked on bullets, cigars, an' got some new

Rockett Rimjob:

"Jeez. Twenny bucks... Just whaddid you do to deserve that much?"
Said Nephi

"...Wait wait wait no please don't answer that"

"S-sorry!"
Said Crystal

"Christ almighty Nephi use yer imagination."
Said Rockett

Crystal Saint Claire carefully exits Whitney's lap, just leaning on her side.

"No"
Said Nephi

"Say mah name, Nephi."
Said Rockett

"I would imagine... hmm..."
Said Crystal

"..."
Said Whitney

"But... I didn't see any grapefruits at the bar..."
Said Crystal

(("MOHAMMAD AVDOL"))Alexander Hauswald:

Whitney G. Elieen takes in a breath

"...Grapefruit-what?"
Said Alexander

"What on earth are you on about, Crystal?"
Said Nephi

"...Whut grapefruits gotta do wit' that?"
Said Cassie-May

"I can explain, but it will require time, and diagrams."
Said Crystal

"Ah'm gonna take a hard pass on that one."
Said Nephi

"I would like that explanation Crystal."
Said Whitney

"...Ah wanna know too now. Ah got curious."
Said Cassie-May

"Curiosity killed th'cat, Miss Cassie."
Said Nephi

"I had a roommate in college who was... promiscuous and inventive."
Said Crystal

"I got meow lives."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Alexander

"This is her greatest scientific achievement."
Said Crystal

"Did she... fuck a grapefruit?"
Said Alexander

"Alex. Language."
Said Nephi

"No, that would be silly."
Said Crystal

"Curiosity killed the cat. Satisfaction brought it back, Nephi."
Said Alexander

"The grapefruit was merely an aid."
Said Crystal

"Use the whole senten-what."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano sticks his fingers in his ears.

"...I see..."
Said Whitney

"...aid how."
Said Cassie-May

"...Sacks, no, I'm not going to ask if it's dog-friendly."
Said Alexander

"In theory, yes."
Said Crystal

"Actually."
Said Rockett

"A real big orange works as a substitute."

"...And of course she knows."
Said Alexander

"Yes, but why waste a large orange when a regular grapefruit would work?"
Said Crystal

"...Ah like grapefruits more than oranges."
Said Cassie-May

"Grapefruits ain't as common."
Said Rockett

"Work with what ya got."

"...either one is fine to me."
Said Whitney

"Please stop talking."
Said Alexander

"I don't think I can eat oranges now."

"In either slices or juiced."
Said Whitney

"So..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire digs in her bag, and pulls out some paper and charcoal pencils.

"Let us begin the learning process."
Said Crystal

"How about we don't."
Said Alexander

"And possibly never mention using fruit as sex aids ever again."

"Well, one typically does not eat the fruit afterwards"
Said Crystal

"Whadaya mean?"
Said Scotty

"Crystal, no."
Said Alexander

"...I figured as mch."
Said Whitney

"Why'd you waste good food like that?"
Said Rockett

"You are atypical."
Said Crystal

Alexander Hauswald pauses, looking at Rockett in disgust.

Rockett Rimjob starts snickering like a jackass.

"God save me."
Said Whitney

"God save all of us."
Said Alexander

"Might be a little too late fer me."
Said Rockett

"...Does tha' count as a fruit salad wit' a dressing?"
Said Cassie-May

"STOP."
Said Alexander

"Cass askin' tha real questions."
Said Rockett

"..."
Said Whitney

Alexander Hauswald shares a sympathetic look with Whitney.

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien gets a dirty smile.

"...Or a protein' shake?"
Said Cassie-May

Nephi "Longiron" Delano still has his fingers in his ears.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has started quietly humming some hymn of some sort.

Alexander Hauswald ponders if it's worth pulling his gun out.

Whitney G. Elieen starts to hum along with Nephi to the tune

Sacks seems interested in this conversation.

Cassie-May O'Brien grins ear to ear.

Crystal Saint Claire is leaning against Whitney again.

"It is for the best I do not explain"
Said Crystal

"It was not relevant knowledge to me."

Whitney G. Elieen squeezes her just a bit.

Crystal Saint Claire leans a bit more

"As it requires"
Said mumble

Crystal Saint Claire ends up leaning into Whitney's lap on her side

Doc is here!Cassie-May O'Brien:

Also, everyone got your CHIPS RECORDED?

Rockett Rimjob flexes

YepNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Rockett Rimjob is BUFF

So I can start the game.

I have yesCassie-May O'Brien:

Whitney G. Elieen does not believe in such garish displays of ego and therefore does not flex!

Recorded.Rockett Rimjob:

didAlexander Hauswald:

Wup

it is doneWhitney G. Elieen:

It is a short journey over to Dodge from Kansas, though it is still a few hundred miles.

The train arrives in the station close to five o clock. The sun is beginning the descent into dusk and light is growing

short. The way to the local clinic is still apparent, even in the dimness. The party follows a dirt road to a shack that

appears to have been recently re-purposed. It seems like just the spot for a fugitive Doc.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano also does not flex

Moon

Draw Fate chips

And record them.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano follows with his Lightning Repeater in hand.

Did so. 2 white, 1 blue

Lucky duckyWhitney G. Elieen:

Whitney G. Elieen clutches her crutch and lets out a deep sigh

The clinic is there, but it looks a little...off now that you're close.

(Why is sacks underneath me)Alexander Hauswald:

You're riding him into battle.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

An overturned cart and a door ajar.

"..."
Said Cassie-May

"Uhh, that ain't normal."
Said Callie

"...We got company."
Said Alexander

"...So's yer right."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks to Cassie.

"...Yew go first."
Said Nephi

Alexander Hauswald draws his gun.

Cassie-May O'Brien pulls the shotgun off her shoulder and prepares it.

Cassie-May O'Brien goes in first.

"...Wait."
Said Alexander

"Are we within town limits?"
Said Crystal

"Cass."
Said Alexander

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers follows with her hand on her gun

"I'm afraid that backing down just ain't in my nature."
Said Doc

Nephi "Longiron" Delano loads bullets into his rifle's cylinder.

"Let Sacks sneak a peak."
Said Alexander

brbWhitney G. Elieen:

Cassie-May O'Brien actually tries to sneak

Those peeking in the door can see a couple rag tag blokes. All with pistols, except the

big fella, he's got an axe.

Rockett Rimjob checks her hips, making sure she's still armed.

All of them are looking to the right side of the house.

Cassie-May O'Brien realizes she probably won;t be able to get a jump on those guys clanking after her

"...Take your places, everyone."
Said Alexander

"There ain't gonna be no Confederates in this town."
Said Beaumont

Crystal Saint Claire sighs.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano goes on a leisurely stroll around the house.

"I watched my wife and child get taken by those bastards."
Said Beaumont

"Barely got my goddamn freedom."

"I think I can make a good argument here... if you'll permit me?"
Said Crystal

Alexander Hauswald stops his breath, focusing on casting a spell or two.

Cassie-May O'Brien points at Callie and at the western window

"...hmmm?"
Said Whitney

Crystal there are dudes inside talkingNephi "Longiron" Delano:

"...Ah don't think they'Rockett Rimjob:

Whitney G. Elieen slowly hobbles forward

Crystal Saint Claire is dragging her bag along.

(Yeah.)Crystal Saint Claire:

they'd pull a gun on a lady like me. Want me to see what's goin' down?"Rockett Rimjob:

"You know, they've got a new man of color in charge up there."
Said Doc

"..."
Said Cassie-May

"Come on Little baws...stay close."
Said Whitney

Cassie-May O'Brien nod nods.

"...Alright, so."
Said Alexander

...Crystal Saint Claire:

is that...

"Rockett, you go take a look. Cassie, you and me are gonna be ready."
Said Alexander

"Don't matter jack shit."
Said Beaumont

Cassie-May O'Brien motions at Rockett to move.

How did I miss thisCrystal Saint Claire:

"Sure thing, buds."
Said Rockett

((Nobody get shot in the head.))Alexander Hauswald:

"Same dogs, new master don't change a damn thing."
Said Beaumont

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has been slowly circling while everybody else is arguing.

y'know...Crystal Saint Claire:

Rockett Rimjob steps right on inside. Her red leather boots tap loudly against the wooden floor as she

saunters inside, looking as scantily-clad as ever.

I have just realizedCrystal Saint Claire:

yeah they've got field of vision on a few of us

Doc Mitchell eyes snap to the door, and to Rockett.

Alexander Hauswald:+014+016+0202

Rockett Rimjob looks at Doc and raises her brows.

"Howdy fellas."
Said Rockett

Nice work Alex!Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Rockett Rimjob looks around the room, getting an eyeful of what's going down.

(Draw six cards per cast, right?)Alexander Hauswald:

"Who the hell are you?"
Said Gnawly

(Plus one for every five points)Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Pretty little lady passin' by. Got some debt Ah oughta collect."
Said Rockett

Crystal Saint Claire calmly loads a Rock Salt Shell into the Opus.

Beaumont Clark lowers his gun, but does not holster it.

Queen of Spades, Red Joker, Pair of sixes.(From Alexander Hauswald):

"Y'all mind if Ah gab a bit with that handsome man over there?" she asks, gesturing to Mitchell.Rockett Rimjob:

Cassie-May O'Brien nods at Alex and nudges her head to the western window.

"I hope I have color-coded these properly..."
Said Crystal

"Afraid you've come in the middle of something."
Said Beaumont

Cassie-May O'Brien nods at Callie and motions east

"Mitchell's letting his honor get in the way of his sense."
Said Beaumont

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers slowly moves to just behind the door

Rockett Rimjob cocks a brow.

"Is he now?"
Said Rockett

Whitney G. Elieen bows her head and says a silent prayer...

(Am ducking)Alexander Hauswald:

"He's usually got a good head on his shoulders," she says, turning to Doc.Rockett Rimjob:

Alexander Hauswald 's gun glows with otherworldly light...

Crystal Saint Claire looks over to Whitney.

"Conflict just ain't in my nature, but letting a patient get hurt isn't either."
Said Doc

The memes begin.Rockett Rimjob:0

(And now for Kentucky Windage.)Alexander Hauswald:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano stands next to the window with his rifle ready, peeking a single eye through it at

those inside.

Oh my god stop referencein' th'damn FoNV Doc Mitchell scene(From Crystal Saint Claire):

Cassie-May O'Brien listens in, ready to move in with her doube-barrell drawn. She loaded slugs last night.

Doc Mitchell adjusts the double barrel's stock on his shoulder.

STOPPIT(From Crystal Saint Claire):

"Well. Sounds like he's followin' his oaths."
Said Rockett

"What's y'all's beef with 'em?"

"Confederate."
Said Denard

Crystal Saint Claire tugs at Cassie's sleeve

Denard speaks with a heavy French accent.

"Not good."
Said Denard

"...?"
Said Cassie-May

"Confederate patient. Makes sense, Ah s'pose."
Said Rockett

"Came in when monsiuer Gallows went out town."
Said Denard

Crystal Saint Claire hands Cassie TWO (2) JALEPENO SHELLS

"Ain't just one."
Said Beaumont

"Whole passel of 'em blew in soon as Sydney was indisposed."

(Ace of hearts, Four of spades, Four of clovers, two of clovers, three of clovers.)(From Alexander Hauswald):

Cassie-May O'Brien stares at Crystal, having the shells just bounce off her.

"Took over the local jail."
Said Beaumont

"..."
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien wonders silently if Crystal expects her to reload the gun NOW.

Rockett Rimjob raises her brows.

Crystal Saint Claire picks them up, and tries to put them in Cassie's pocket.

"Ah'll be. Doc, did you have a clue who you was fixin' up?"
Said Rockett

Crystal Saint Claire mouths the words "in case."

"Ah know in yer line'a work ya don't got much time ta ponder."
Said Rockett

"That I did."
Said Doc

Cassie-May O'Brien blinks and gently but firmly pushes Crystal backwards.

Crystal Saint Claire falls on her butt.

Is he tied up?Rockett Rimjob:

Cassie-May O'Brien resists the urge to facepalm.

Crystal Saint Claire has... REALLY POOR balance.

Doc.Rockett Rimjob:

nopeDoc Mitchell:

He's standing everyone else off with a double barrel shotgun.

Crystal Saint Claire stands up.

Whitney G. Elieen hobbles a bit closer

Crystal Saint Claire checks her bag,making sure it is unharmed.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano spies Alex looking in through the other window.

Crystal Saint Claire puts her gun back in the bag.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano resists the urge to wave

"Could y'all do me a favor an' slip them things back in their holsters? An' Ah don't mean that tent

you's pitchin', big guy," she says to the man right in front of her.

Rockett Rimjob:

"Let's be reasonable about this."

He IS a doctor, after all.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Cassie-May O'Brien prays the guys inside won't actually see Crystal bumbling about in the doorway.

Big house comes with that.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Wait a tickDoc Mitchell:

"All you. 'Cludes you, Doc."
Said Rockett

Crystal Saint Claire is a child with bag.

(So. How much do I get in terms of magic bonuses?)(From UrbanCritter):

Persuasion roll.Doc Mitchell:

I don't have my macros set up, butRockett Rimjob:

Ask Neb, I haven't got the Huckstering tables memorized(To UrbanCritter):

Rockett Rimjob:

Persuasion is a clash against-Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Rockett Rimjob:

OhNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Oh lawd.

I win.Rockett Rimjob:

Yeah.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

IT's beatable, but it's aCrystal Saint Claire:

"Reckon you're right Miss Rockett."
Said Doc

HELL of a roll to beat!Crystal Saint Claire:

Now they roll their Scrutinize, I think.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Do I get any bonuses for being a real purdy, revealed lady in a room full of dirty duderinos?Rockett Rimjob:

(To GM) rolling 3d8kh1!!

Doc Mitchell:+0102

You don't need anyDoc Mitchell:

Doc Mitchell lets his shotgun fall to his side.

What about the others?Rockett Rimjob:000

Beaumont Clark holsters his pistol, reluctantly.

Denard tucks his gun into his overall pocket.

Rockett Rimjob saunters on over to Mitchell, slowly, careful not to seem too urgent or threatening.

Marbh Teine holsters.

Doc Mitchell raises an eyebrow to Rockett as she walks over.

"Now. Ah can't fault Doc fer doin' his job. He's a respectable man with a solid set'a morals he

practices jus' as much as 'e practices 'is faith."

Rockett Rimjob:

"Same time, though, Ah can't fault folks fer havin' a couple scores ta settle."

"Rest of them are still up at the jail."
Said Doc

"Wouldn't go looking for 'em though."

"..."
Said Crystal

Rockett gets a fate chip for her double ace roll.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

I do?Rockett Rimjob:

She does?Cassie-May O'Brien:

Crystal Saint Claire tries to speak to Whitney using Navaho Sign Language!

If she got more than three raises (Beat their roll by 15)Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

She doooo!Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"They've got enough guns poking out of it that anything walking over to it'll get holier than a Pope."
Said Doc

What kind?Rockett Rimjob:

Random.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

ooohRockett Rimjob:

I got you blue.Doc Mitchell:

That was how Harry cheesed the fuck outta this game.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

He cheesed his Overawe so high he'd win by 15 points or more every time.

Not here.

YarDoc Mitchell:

"Well. These boys here look like they're packin' some heat."
Said Rockett

"They got some guns, too," she says as an afterthought. "But they ain't wanna risk none'a that, do ya?" she asks

"I suppose not."
Said Beaumont

Crystal Saint Claire is hugging Whitney's good leg.

"Lettin' a lady walk all over ya aye?"
Said Marbh

"Soft hearted awld blackie y'are."

Whitney G. Elieen places a hand on her head and ruffles

Whitney G. Elieen smiles softly

Cassie-May O'Brien tensed up

Beaumont Clark turns to Teine with no expression on his face.

"...maybe Ah was wrong."
Said Rockett

Beaumont Clark lays a hand on the smaller man's shoulder.

Beaumont Clark pats him twice and grins.

"No softer than an paddie without potatoes."
Said Beaumont

Marbh Teine throws his red head back in a belly laugh.

"...damn, that's cold."
Said Rockett

"Ye fucker you."
Said Marbh

Cassie-May O'Brien relaxed a bit

"If y'ask me, y'all look like you could handle some Fedders, way you spooked Mitchell. Might

need a visit ta Mitchell afterwards, though, which Ah'm sure he'll be more'n happy ta oblige."

Rockett Rimjob:

"Wouldn't 'e?"

Rockett Rimjob looks at Doc.

"Never turned down a patient."
Said Doc

I can't even right nowWhitney G. Elieen:

"There ya have it, folks. Reckon you wouldn't lose an arm an' a leg, in either tha literal sense or

tha coinpurse sense. Ah'm sure Ah could help y'all out if it meant clearin' out some rowdy Fedders."

Rockett Rimjob:

Crystal Saint Claire hugs Whitknee

"Maybe he can help your leg."
Said Crystal

"...with costs. Not tha gunfight. Ah'm sure y'all wouldn't need a lady helpin' you out there

Rockett Rimjob:

Sackhead hacks up something that stains the other side of the facemask.

Doc Mitchell walks over to the other side of the slab and picks up a stethoscope.

Rockett Rimjob turns back to the five men on the other side of the room.

"We can use all the help we can get."
Said Beaumont

How HUGE is Beaumont?(From Crystal Saint Claire):

not near as big as Whitney.(To Poage):

Garret is actually bigger than Beaumont.(To Poage):

"Ah'm sure there're some rowdy folks in Dodge proper willin' ta help you out. Ask 'round tha bar."
Said Rockett

Anywhere near Inyanga size, any of 'em?(From Crystal Saint Claire):

Oh shit even Whitney(From Crystal Saint Claire):

"Reckon there might be."
Said Beaumont

"Might also be sympathizers."

"Only one way to find out 'Monty."
Said Herrelson

"Ain't too hard ta weed out Fedders."
Said Rockett

"Not too hard to find them."
Said Herrelson

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers grumbles softly to herself

"Hard to weed out."
Said Herrelson

"Keep growing up in unlikely places."

"Like eight day rash."

Can Uncle Ichabod be the TF2 Demoman?(From Crystal Saint Claire):

"Point is. Y'all's beef lies with Fedders, not some poor ethical bastard tryin' ta make ends meet.

He's offerin' ya help, one way 'r the other."

Rockett Rimjob:

"Y'get me?"

"I get you."
Said Beaumont

Gnawly Garret taps his hand against his dusty trousers.

"Monty, I gots to get back to the chopping, eh?"
Said Gnawly

Beaumont Clark shrugs his shoulders and cracks his neck.

"Alright, sorry to have taken up your time."
Said Beaumont

"Thanks, fellas. 'Preciate reasonable folk like y'all."
Said Rockett

Beaumont Clark tips his hat to Rockett and Doc Mitchell.

"Be seein' you."
Said Beaumont

"Wouldn't mind seeing more of her."
Said Gnawly

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers steps away from the door

Cassie-May O'Brien relaxes, loweing her shotgun and jus chilling against the frame.

"That'll cost ya a little extra. Ah'll be at tha bar t'night, fellas~"
Said Rockett

"Keep it in your pants Garret."
Said Marbh

The men file out. None seem surprised by the rest of the party standing on the other

side of the door.

Cassie-May O'Brien tips her stetson to them as they pass by.

Rockett Rimjob turns to Doc, and her happy expression wilts as soon as all the fellas are out the door.

"Fellas."
Said Cassie-May

"Scuse me."
Said Gnawly

"You. Owe me,"
Said she

Crystal Saint Claire looks downward as the men pass

Whitney G. Elieen backs herself up ever so slightly

"Kindly thanks, eh."
Said Gnawly

Crystal Saint Claire steps out of the way, trying to pull her bag.

"God bless."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen bows her head as they walk out

"..."
Said Alexander

"..."
Said Cassie-May

"I think I like her."
Said Alexander

"C'mon in, Hauswald. Cassie."
Said Rockett

"Rest of ya."

Cassie-May O'Brien puts her shotgun on her shoulder and slinks inside.

Rockett Rimjob looks a little tired of Doc's shit.

Alexander Hauswald walks in, followed by doggo.

Doc Mitchell purses his lips and nods.

"I'mpressive work, Rockett."
Said Alexander

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers tips her hat to Doc

"Thanks."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien tips her hat.

Rockett Rimjob turns to Doc.

Alexander Hauswald nods at Doc.

"Doc Mitchell, I presume."
Said Alexander

"Knew 's gewd ta have yew 'round.'Cassie-May O'Brien:

Whitney G. Elieen hobbles forward

Cassie-May O'Brien did not holster her shotgun in the sling on her back yet.

"Right, they all gone?"
Said Nephi

Doc Mitchell slices open the shirt of the man on the slab. There's a rather large set of lacerations running

across the abdomen, and what looks like a pair of boobs.

"...What hurt her?"
Said Alexander

"..."
Said Whitney

"Fix up that poor sod. You can talk an' work, right, Mitchell?" she asks, glancing down at her.Rockett Rimjob:

"Knew that, probably wouldn't be so spry."
Said Doc

"..."
Said Whitney

"..."
Said Crystal

"Course."
Said Doc

"Step aside..."
Said Whitney

Rockett Rimjob rolls her eyes.

"What are the extent of the injuries?"
Said Whitney

"Whitney."
Said Crystal

Doc Mitchell eyes Whitney for a long moment.

"Do. Not."
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen puts a hand up to shush Crystal

"I don't think so Miss."
Said Doc

"You've got the look about you."

"Who is this one that lays here?"
Said Whitney

"...You can trust her."
Said Alexander

"She does a good job."

"What can you tell me of her, dear doctor?"
Said Whitney

"I wish only to help. In what little way i can."

"Don't know much. She's with that band of boys, and girls I guess, up at the jail."
Said Doc

"Think she might be one of them specialized soldiers."

Whitney G. Elieen closes her eyes and nods

Whitney G. Elieen lets out a deep sigh

"Supposed to use that new fangled tech."
Said Doc

"How long has she been like this?"
Said Whitney

"Whitney..."
Said Crystal

"Crystal...it is okay. I promise."
Said Whitney

"You promised you would not bite off more than you can chew."
Said Crystal

"..."
Said Alexander

Doc Mitchell brings needle, thread, and alcohol over to the table.

"I've got this here Miss."
Said Doc

Whitney G. Elieen reaches her hand over to the lady

"Rockett, what did you want to talk about?"
Said Doc

"Let the doc try to handle it firs,t actually."
Said Alexander

"Please, at least get examined before you try to do this..."
Said Crystal

Alexander Hauswald gently rests his hand on Whitney's shoulder.

"..."
Said Whitney

"Christ sake Whitney let tha man do his fuckin' work."
Said Rockett

"We do not know the extent of the damage."
Said Crystal

Rockett Rimjob turns back to Mitchell, trying her best to not be irritated.

"Let him work. You'll help later."
Said Alexander

Whitney G. Elieen closes her eyes

Whitney G. Elieen:+02+06+0209

Whitney places her hand upon the wound and closes her eyes shut...saying a silent prayer that God may deliver

them from their wounds

Alexander Hauswald takes a step back.

"Ah got a couple questions 'bout what happened. We all do."
Said Rockett

"Whit--"
Said Crystal

Doc Mitchell steps back from the table for a moment.

Crystal Saint Claire tries to pull her back!

Whitney G. Elieen stands tall and firm

Crystal Saint Claire:01

And that's a BUST.

bustCassie-May O'Brien:

lmaoRockett Rimjob:

Educational process for ScottyCrystal Saint Claire:

some broken ribs as well as the lacerations.

Whitney G. Elieen grits her teeth as hard as she can

I am familiar yesRockett Rimjob:

Whitney G. Elieen withdrawls her hand after a moment and takes a deep breath

"I'm gonna have to ask that you stay away from my patient before you end up on the slab yourself."
Said Doc

"..."
Said Alexander

"Whitney. Are you okay?"

GM chips are used to bail the bads outta trouble or make them roll better, really.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

any consequences to that Bust roll?(From Crystal Saint Claire):

Back in a tickDoc Mitchell:0

"She's gunna say yes an' completeleh ignore yew sayin' anythin' against whut she jus' did."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Whitney

"Ain'cha, Whitney?"
Said Cassie-May

"It only hurts."
Said Whitney

"...Whitney."
Said Alexander

"Nothing more."
Said Whitney

"She won't... lie to me."
Said Crystal

"Yer fuckin' hobblin'."
Said Cassie-May

Alexander Hauswald just looks at her.

"To do what I did here is not the same as what was done before."
Said Whitney

"Sometime you can't take a burden."
Said Alexander

"Painful yes...but within my power."
Said Whitney

"Whitney..."
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien sighed.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano folds his arms and waits.

"I am...going to have a sit down. God be with you."
Said Whitney

"...Doc, as yew were doin'."
Said Cassie-May

"...Listen. I'm going to watch the door, in case those guys come back."
Said Nephi

Alexander Hauswald sighs.

Crystal Saint Claire follows Whitney

"We need to talk, Doc."
Said Alexander

Whitney G. Elieen hobbles to the wall

Whitney G. Elieen leans herself upon it

"About the murder of Marshall Jones."
Said Alexander

Whitney G. Elieen takes a deep breath

Whitney G. Elieen is still gritting her teeth

Cassie-May O'Brien uncocks the shotgun and places it back in her sling.

"That's right. We need ta know what ya know, Doc -- you's tha only one that can say anythin'

about it."

Rockett Rimjob:

"Anythin' you can tell us? Anythin' at all?"

"Any lil' detail can help."
Said Cassie-May

Hold on a sec.Doc Mitchell:

Whitney G. Elieen stays silent, both out of pain and curiosity

Doc Mitchell leans back on his surgical table and sighs. His eyes drift closed.

"What exactly, do ya'll want to know?"
Said Doc

"Jones got shot."

"He died."

"Nothing I could do."

"Who shot him?"
Said Cassie-May

"When it happened. Who shot 'em, if ya saw 'em. What they looked like if so. What tha shooter

was shootin', if you could tell. Where he came from an' ran off to afterwards. Did he have a horse?"

Rockett Rimjob:

"Did Jones have any last words, or was it too clean a shot?"

Doc Mitchell the knuckles of his hands stand out white as alabaster as he grips the desk.

"I don't know."
Said Doc

"..."
Said Alexander

"...Pardon?"
Said Cassie-May

"I saw him."
Said Doc

"Do you know what he looked like?"
Said Alexander

"I saw his face."
Said Doc

"I looked straight at him."

"And...I don't know."

"...Yew mean yew can't remember his face?"
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Crystal

"It's like..."
Said Doc

"He didn't have one."

"Eeeyup?"
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Alexander

"...Whuddya mean."
Said Cassie-May

"No face."
Said Alexander

"Naw... facial features? Jus' a blank un'?"
Said Cassie-May

"Or...too many."
Said Doc

"Or y'all jus' can't remember wh-?"
Said Cassie-May

Doc Mitchell takes a journal off his surgical table and tears a page out. He takes an ink pen out of his

jacket pocket.

Whitney G. Elieen opens her eyes and looks over...

Whitney G. Elieen slowly pushes herself off the wall

Doc Mitchell puts the page down on a clear spot of the slab and starts sketching.

"His hat was...what you'd expect a cheap desperado to wear."
Said Doc

"Same as the clothes."

"What you expect."

"Anything distinguishing? A gun? Buckle?"
Said Alexander

"But...the face."
Said Doc

Crystal Saint Claire is sitting on the floor now.

Crystal Saint Claire has he knees to her chest.

Doc Mitchell scribbles jagged, angry lines over where the head should be underneath the hat.

"..."
Said Rockett

"...Was it scarred to all hell? Or some sorta..."

Cassie-May O'Brien scratched her head.

Rockett Rimjob trails off, not sure what to call it.

Cassie-May O'Brien looked over at Alexander.

"...Tha's sumthin' huckstin'-like. Or manitous."
Said Cassie-May

"You know how..."
Said Doc

Alexander Hauswald , a veteran of the weird west and an expert in the occult, examines the drawing very

"A face."
Said Doc

"Can get shaded by the brim of a wide hat?"

"It was like that."

"...might I take a look?"
Said Whitney

"...Righ."
Said Cassie-May

"And it was like that even if he was staring into the sun."
Said Doc

"His whole face was shade."
Said Alexander

"Got it.

"...Hm."
Said Rockett

"The shadow, didn't move right."
Said Doc

Whitney G. Elieen hobbles just a bit closer

((Anything I need to roll, Doc? Knowledge (Occult) or something?))Alexander Hauswald:

wuz' wearin' cheap clothes. But whut 'bout his gun? Whut he shot th' Marshal wit'?"

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Go ahead and roll.Doc Mitchell:

Cassie-May O'Brien also tries to jog her occultist memory.

Alexander Hauswald:+04+01+0803

"Somethin' that took Jones down... had ta be big. You got any clue?"
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien:01

I have the best luck lol

Fawk yewAlexander Hauswald:

damnRockett Rimjob:

lolololWhitney G. Elieen:

Alexander recalls something to do with a peculiar individual like this.

Been sighted in a couple other towns.

But he can't quite recall the name they gave it...

"...Heard of this before."
Said Alexander

The Revenant.(To dimVitrarius):

"Someone... People saw this man in other places."
Said Alexander

"I can't remember the name."

"...Wait..."
Said Cassie-May

"...Ah think Ah..."

"It's on the tip of my damn tongue but I can't..."
Said Alexander

"...what else do you remember of this...being?"Whitney G. Elieen:00

Cassie-May O'Brien closed her eyes.

"...Revenant. 'S a revenant."
Said Cassie-May

"...Revenant."
Said Alexander

"Fuck."
Said Cassie-May

"That sounds dangerous."
Said Crystal

"Doc? Th' gun? Cummawn, sugercune."
Said Cassie-May

Nephi "Longiron" Delano stands by Crystal now.

"Was a Colt forty four."
Said Doc

"...Fourty f-"
Said Cassie-May

"Well maintained."
Said Doc

Cassie-May O'Brien closes her eyes and shudders, remembering the weird nightmare.

Crystal Saint Claire takes the little black box out of her bag.

"...Where wuz th' dead marshall shot?"
Said Cassie-May

((God dammit why is there so little Deadlands shit online))Alexander Hauswald:

(you check my sta.sh with the books man)Cassie-May O'Brien:

(I know but I just wanted a quick look, not to tear open the books to see this one specific

Alexander Hauswald:

Don't be that guyNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Doc Mitchell picks the pen up off the paper and points it at his right eye.

"Someone explain"
Said Crystal

"Load fulla hogwash, it sounds like."
Said Nephi

"It's just a fella with a weird hat."

"...Alright. I... I think I know a thing or two about revenants."
Said Alexander

"All this gasping and ''oh no" is all very dramatic, but useless for conveying information."
Said Crystal

"It goes in towns, finds the most senior lawman, and shoots 'em dead."
Said Alexander

"...What's the date?"

"Anywhere else, Doc? Jus' th' eye?"
Said Cassie-May

"Only took one shot."
Said Doc

"I'm a Revenant, and nobody looks at me funny"
Said Crystal

"Jones was still babbling, but he was dead soon as the bullet went through him."
Said Doc

"Trust me, I've seen a fair few head wounds in my time."

"What's the date today?"
Said Alexander

Rockett Rimjob grits her teeth.

"Just checking to see if anyone can hear me."
Said Crystal

"What is the date..?"

"This... This is all myth I'm hearing, but next time we hear from him should be the

thirteenth of the month at High Noon."

Alexander Hauswald:

Okay son you don't know everything.Doc Mitchell:

(Okay. Didn't say he knows how to kill 'im. Thanks for stopping me, though.)Alexander Hauswald:

"... Right."

does Cassie know how to kill him? :D(From Cassie-May O'Brien):

"We got six days."
Said Alexander

lol no.(To dimVitrarius):

"Before...what."
Said Crystal

"Before he shows up."
Said Alexander

"And kills someone."

"'Fore it chows up an' kills a lawman again."
Said Cassie-May

"Okay, that's what you START WITH."
Said Crystal

"It gits worse."
Said Cassie-May

"'V'COURSE."
Said Crystal

"Stop shoutin'."
Said Cassie-May

Alexander Hauswald looks at Cassie.

Crystal Saint Claire takes a deep breath.

"Explain everything you know."
Said Crystal

"...Don't recall how we kill it."
Said Alexander

"Do not assume we know anything."
Said Crystal

"Eeenope. But Ah sure as sugar know it's real real hard ta kill."
Said Cassie-May

"Awkay - th' good news is, them folks are all safe. Tha' thing only targets them of th' law."

"Do you think... this would do it?"
Said Crystal

is this thing similar to "The judge" that Whitney witnessed so long ago?(From Whitney G. Elieen):

Crystal Saint Claire holds out a the little black box containing the Ghost Shell she purchased.

"...Bad news are we're the law."
Said Alexander

"Least we know who's it gunna target... Sorta."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien looks at Crystal.

"Whuzzit again?"
Said Cassie-May

It sounds as spooky, but not like the Judge.(To Yuppie b.):

"It's... a shotshell."
Said Crystal

"...It is clear to me that the power granted to me is not enough."
Said Whitney

"A very, very potent one."
Said Crystal

"I am forbidden by law to fire it within city limits, to my knowledge."

"Ah heard 'bout them Revenants bein' blown up wit' dynamita ta high heaven an' coming."
Said Cassie-May

"That may have just been a promise with the owner."
Said Crystal

"... I'll ask the deadman when we get back if he knows a thing or two about it."
Said Alexander

"I must take sometime after this to spend in prayer. I must request guidance."
Said Whitney

"Sawnds like a gew idea."
Said Cassie-May

"...Thanks, Mitchell. This helps. Ain't much ta work with, but we had nothin' ten minutes ago."
Said Rockett

"This works just fine."
Said Alexander

"We go home. We fortify."

"Yes. Thank you doctor. You have been a God send."
Said Whitney

"Ain'much? We got th' time, we got th' list a' targets."
Said Cassie-May

"All we need is knowin' how ta kill it."

"So... how much do we know about Revenants?"
Said Crystal

"When that thing comes, we pump it full of lead and silver until it stops moving."
Said Alexander

"Not how to kill them."

"Who said he'd come ta Dodge? Who said he'd come ta any town in the Midwest specifically?"
Said Rockett

"We know what it does... do we know what it is?"
Said Crystal

"Let alone how ta kill this thing an' walk away with our own lives."
Said Rockett

"IT's an evil spirit, Crystal."
Said Cassie-May

"It's coming for senior lawmen."
Said Alexander

"We're the senior lawmen."

"...So..."
Said Cassie-May

"I assume this takes care of what I owe you, Miss Rockett?"
Said Doc

"It's gonna target one of us sooner or later."
Said Alexander

"So... it is an evil spirit..."
Said Crystal

"Ah'll call it square."
Said Rockett

"Guess it's gunna, eeeyup..."
Said Cassie-May

"Fer sure."
Said Rockett

You're junior lawmen.

The Senior lawmen would be...still in Dodge.

Oh.Alexander Hauswald:

"Which will target senior lawmen..."
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien bit her thumb.

"...Overmarshall."
Said Cassie-May

"...Hang on."
Said Alexander

"And... it will do so... why?"
Said Crystal

Alexander Hauswald looks at Mitchell.

"Who's the sheriff here?"
Said Alexander

"Don't suppose I've got any goodwill left over, do I?"
Said Doc

Doc Mitchell turns from Rockett to Alex.

"Sheriff Sidney."
Said Doc

"Most call him Gallows."

"I assume you can guess why."

"...Guess he's our next visit."
Said Alexander

"Might be hard to find."
Said Doc

"Maybe later, Mitchell. Ah'm a little too rattled ta be handin' out goodwill just yet."
Said Rockett

"Why would that be?"
Said Whitney

((Is goodwill codename for something))Alexander Hauswald:

"He left to go looking for something."
Said Doc

"'Sides. You might wanna save up for tha supplies those dumbasses are gonna cost ya."
Said Rockett

"...Any idea what?"
Said Alexander

(Charity. Handouts.)Rockett Rimjob:

Cassie-May O'Brien kept biting her thumb for a moment.

"...Why do we assume it's gunna appear 'ere in Dodge?"
Said Cassie-May

"Left soon after I got here and he questioned me about my coming."
Said Doc

"Assume it was to hunt down what killed Jones."

"..."
Said Cassie-May

"...Fantastic."
Said Alexander

"...Welp."
Said Cassie-May

"Perhaps he's looking for a way to dispose of this Revenent?"
Said Crystal

"We sure shoulda ourselves."
Said Cassie-May

"He's more of one to..."
Said Doc

"Where'd Gallows go?"
Said Cassie-May

"Yew got a direction?"

"I'll head home and ask Deadman. Maybe find a Huckster."
Said Alexander

"Charge into his problems head on."
Said Doc

"Don't rightly know."

"Might be something at his offices."

"When'd he left exactleh? Y'all know nuthin'? Not even direction?"
Said Cassie-May

"Do you know which, if any, bars he frequented?"
Said Crystal

"Then we head there."
Said Alexander

"But you'll have a hell of a time getting in there with the Confederates clogging it."
Said Doc

"Ah might be able ta help with that."
Said Callie

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers flashes her Ranger star

"...Eeeyup. Guess we ain' got a choice but ta git our asses ta th' Sheriff's office an' have

Callie 'ere play up 'er graycoatin' business."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"And Gallows usually went to the Pert Puss in town."
Said Doc

"Got a few leads..."
Said Cassie-May

"Guess Ah know where Ah'm goin'."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Hmmm..."
Said Doc

"Generalleh occultists."
Said Cassie-May

Doc Mitchell pulls at his mustache as he thinks.

"Might try...Hamilton. Hamilton Hendricks."
Said Doc

...Crystal Saint Claire:

"Where can I find him?"
Said Alexander

(If the two magicians ship)Crystal Saint Claire:

"Graveyard."
Said Doc

(Can we agree to call the ship)Crystal Saint Claire:

"He's the tender."
Said Doc

(Alexander Hamilton?)Crystal Saint Claire:

(Yes)Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"Guess that's where I'm going."
Said Alexander

"Meh too."
Said Cassie-May

"Do you know of anywhere that might have information, doctor?"
Said Crystal

"A library, or some similar building?"

"...Yew know... We oughtn't split up too much. Goin' in twos."
Said Cassie-May

"Anyone has books on this, it'd be Hendricks."
Said Doc

"...Guess we're all heading to Hendricks."
Said Alexander

"Wise words indeed. Alone we are weak. Especially against the forces of evil."
Said Whitney

"An' as much as Ah'd like ta go meet tha' grave tender, mighta be nawt best use of mah

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"We splittin' up in twos, or goin' all at once?"
Said Rockett

"Ah'd rather split up."

"Get more shit done."

"Ah say all at once."
Said Callie

"Ah think we oughta split in twos."
Said Cassie-May

"I know I'm going to him."
Said Alexander

"Any of you want to come along, you're welcome."

"Split in twos. Yes."
Said Whitney

"Or however many required."

"...Y'all are convinced it's some crazy evil spirit, huh?"
Said Nephi

mosta anyone."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Crystal an' Whitney, yer on th' library duty."

"Whatever is doing this, it's following all the rules this "crazy spirit" follows. So if we know

the rules, we can extrapolate its actions."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"So it shall be done."
Said Whitney

"A question Doctor...what day is it today?

'Yer inseparable anyway an' mahbe there Whitney ain' gunna try faith healin' everythin' in

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Whitney G. Elieen:

"It is the third."
Said Crystal

"Guess I'm with Nephi or Rockett?"
Said Alexander

"Rockett?"
Said Cassie-May

"...no wait"
Said Crystal

"The second"

"Yer gonna go ta th' bar."
Said Cassie-May

"Ah think yew oughta take NEphi."

"If it is within my power to help those in need."
Said Whitney

"Then I must."

"this is my commandment."

"Alex... Yew git Sacks Ah guess?"
Said Cassie-May

"And speaking of commandments...is today Friday?"
Said Whitney

"You heard tha woman Nephi.Rockett Rimjob:

"Get up, son. We're goin' to tha bar."

"...Suppose I do."
Said Alexander

"Come on, Sacks. We're going to the graveyard."

"Rrrrruff."
Said Sacks

"...Cassie, why'd you pair me with Rockett?"
Said Nephi

"You're a service dog. Man up."
Said Alexander

It is a bit late, and all of you did just blow into town.

"Because it's funny."
Said Alexander

"'Cuz that's hilarious."
Said Cassie-May

Perhaps it would be wiser to find somewhere to sleep first?

Before getting up to all this business.

"...Ah hate yew all."
Said Nephi

"An' a doubtin' thomas like yew's a shit idea ta take ta an occultit."
Said Cassie-May

"Because Ah need a good Mormon boy like you ta keep a sinful lady like me in check."
Said Rockett

"...Fine, fine. Guess I gotta do the good lord's work, huh?"
Said Nephi

"Let's go, buddy."
Said Rockett

"Go with God son of Joseph."
Said Whitney

"Better believe I'll be keepin an eye on you."
Said Nephi

"Do keep my sister safe."
Said Whitney

"Rockett, if y'all ain' bringin' Nephi piss drunk an' covered in ladies, Ah'd be disappointed."
Said Cassie-May

"...You take care, all right, Doc?"
Said she

"No foolin with gentlemen's private bits while I'm around.":Nephi "
Said Longiron

"... So. Where do we meet up?"
Said Alexander

"ESPECIALLY mine."
Said Nephi

"Best I can Miss Rockett."
Said Doc

"We clkear?"
Said Nephi

"Best I can."
Said Doc

"Here?"
Said Cassie-May

"It's already late."
Said Alexander

"...wait up."
Said Cassie-May

"You go off and be the center of attention."
Said Doc

"No touchin' gentlemen."
Said Rockett

"I'll be here."
Said Doc

"Alex got a point."
Said Cassie-May

"Roger roger."
Said Rockett

"Mahbe we oughta git some sleep an' start first thing in th' morning?"
Said Cassie-May

"...Ah get the feelin she's goin to find a loophole for that."
Said Nephi

Rockett Rimjob looks at the horse. Whose horse is that?

((No touching gentlemen, Rockett says as she proceeds to lez up every woman in sight.))Alexander Hauswald:

((I was thinking more of, "this fella 'ere ain' no gentleman"))Cassie-May O'Brien:

Rockett heads off to the bar.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano sighs.

"Is there anything further you require doctor? The library may be closed at this time and if

there is more that can be done for the one on the table..."

Whitney G. Elieen:

She will, assumedly, find somewhere to sleep.

And someone to sleep with.

"Lord, yer humble servant is gonna need some mighty strong blessings for this one..."
Said Nephi

"Whitney... we are going to Henderson, at the graveyard."
Said Crystal

"I shall assist. In more mundane ways."
Said Whitney

"Oh!"
Said Crystal

"Doc, whut can y'all tell us 'bout them Confederates occupyin' them sheriffin' offices?"
Said Cassie-May

"Is it Friday Crystal?"
Said Whitney

"Longiron!"
Said Crystal

"...We're going there too."
Said Alexander

"This is a very important question."
Said Whitney

"Me and Sacks."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is already gone.

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire thinks. IS it Friday?

"Not much."
Said Doc

"Came into town a day after Gallows left."

"Right. Missy Rockett. You walk softly, and ah carry th'big gun, yeah?"
Said Nephi

"Was hoping to ask this little lady a few questions."
Said Doc

Doc Mitchell taps the woman on the slab.

"Unless they still got a no-gun policy in town."
Said Nephi

"Oh honey Ah ain't walkin' softly."
Said Rockett

"If they do, ah think Alex is gonna be in trouble."
Said Nephi

(yep)Doc Mitchell:

"How many of 'em? How arned?"
Said Cassie-May

"A curious woman..."
Said Whitney

"If they do, Ah'm gonna have tha upper hand."
Said Rockett

"Three gatlings poking out the sides of the sheriff office."
Said Doc

"As for personal arms..."

"Let's go find somewhere to sleep and handle this in the morning."
Said Alexander

Doc Mitchell reaches under the woman on the slab and pulls out a short looking rifle with a box magazine.

"They've got carbines."
Said Doc

Crystal Saint Claire is STILL trying to figure out what day it is, of the week.

"...Mmm."
Said Cassie-May

(Is there a roll?)Crystal Saint Claire:

(to)Doc Mitchell:

(WHAT WEEKDAY IS IT)Crystal Saint Claire:

Roll smarts.Doc Mitchell:

On a calendar.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Said Whitney

"And tomorrow"

"The lord's day is a holy one and must be observed. And I must beseech her for guidance"
Said Whitney

Crystal doesn't have a calander on her.Crystal Saint Claire:

And she's 3/4 blind

Look at a newspaperNephi "Longiron" Delano:

((I think so yes, Alex))Cassie-May O'Brien:

"...So. Are we going?"
Said Alexander

"Whitney... I believe he wishes to go tonight."
Said Crystal

"To allow time to think upon any information recieved tomorrow."

"Let's get SOME rest and see where we go from there."
Said Alexander

"The lord calls me to prayer this sabbath evening. A quiet place will do just fine."
Said Whitney

"Hauswold, if you go tomorrow, Whitney will remain here."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Come on, Sacks."

"You don't need to explain, kid."

"Crystal. If you must go then I will not begrudge you. They are in need of your guidance."
Said Whitney

"I will be fine here."

"No you won't."
Said Alexander

"I promise on the honor of the Lord."
Said Whitney

walks up to Nephi and pulls down the newspaperRockett Rimjob:

"...Promise me you won't touch anyone."
Said Crystal

"You'll kill yourself trying to fix everyone who comes in."
Said Alexander

(I gotta go. Gotta get ready for work and figure out what I wanna bring for food)Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"I promise...I will not do what I can not do."
Said Whitney

(welp)Cassie-May O'Brien:

"...fine."
Said Crystal

"Thank you."
Said Whitney

"God willing, when you see me again, I will be stronger..."

Crystal Saint Claire walks over to Sacks, appearing to be addressing the dog.

"Let us depart."
Said Crystal

"Do either of you know the way to the graveyard?"

Sacks barks and looks at Alexander, amused.

"... Doc?"
Said Alexander

"Thinking how to tell you."
Said Doc

"Head through town and take a left at the barber's place."

"Keep going until you see stone sticking out the ground."

"Dully noted."
Said Alexander

"..Guess we're all goin' right now."
Said Cassie-May

"Come on, Callie."

"Let's go, Crystal."
Said Alexander

"Yes."
Said Crystal

"...go with God"
Said Whitney

(But not now now because we're wrapping up, right?)Alexander Hauswald:

You can keep them for future occurences, or you could cash them in for Bounty points

which are basically EXP.

Alexander Hauswald:

Whitney G. Elieen:

Lord be praised

Hey.

i will be right backWhitney G. Elieen:

That's pretty good.

So what could I use them on if not cashing them in rnRockett Rimjob:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano doesn't do anything with Rockett other than try his best to interfere.

Getting rid of wounds.

Making better rolls.

Not getting boned.

Yep.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

You could keep them to get rid of wounds or undo shit rolls.Alexander Hauswald:

Also.

You spend a fate chip to help buff up important rolls.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

They're like bursts in that way.

Time for SPOOPS.

So I'm thinking keep 1 blue and 1 red and 1 white?Rockett Rimjob:

Oh dear.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

That a safe idea?Rockett Rimjob:

Yeah.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Be MURRICAN00000

Probably go for two blues just in case.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Usually good to keep those around just in case someone gets a lucky crit headshot.

Nephi, it is late.

It happens.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

You can't sleep.

But yeah, Doc, I cashed my white chips.Alexander Hauswald:

Cashing in two blues and four whites for 10 points then.(From Rockett Rimjob):

Good on ya.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano spends his time cleaning and polishing his guns when unable to sleep or busy.

That rifle is shining bright as the morning sun.

In the lantern light.

Outside there's a moon hanging in the sky.

Big and full.

Might be nice to take a look at it out the window.

and backWhitney G. Elieen:

i will decide upon the new miracle then, and pay the necessary fee

in light of what we have learned

"...Good good. Nice and-"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano hears Rockett in the next room.

"...Dear heavenly father, please let Miss Rocket know just a bit of your divine justice."
Said Nephi

Everything looks fine as your eyes pass over it at first Nephi.

"Amen."
Said Nephi

fwap fwap fwap fwap fwap fwapRockett Rimjob:

But when you look back, there's an odd light out there.

Looks to be a lantern out on the trail.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads out towards the door, rifle in hand. Nephi goes with the gatling this time,

feeling quite a bit more on edge.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano peeks out towards the lantern, checking the time on his pocketwatch

No not yet. Though i have the chips for that i believe.Whitney G. Elieen:

AFAIK you have to do that before getting new miracles, but if you read something

otherwise in Fire and Brimstone go ahead.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Looks to be just a regular oil lantern.

Fifteen minutes to midnight.

Is it moving?Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Sitting still.

Who would leave a lantern out on the ground.

"Who else is up at this hour'a night?"
Said Nephi

Yes I am going with the twenty four hour prayer methodWhitney G. Elieen:

Oh.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

I was not aware that was a thing.

Link me the relevant passage later.

lemme pull up the brimstone docWhitney G. Elieen:

Send it to me on Discord.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano writes a little note on the back of some paper for Rockett that he went out to

investigate a weird light and if he's not back to come looking.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano grabs his gun, sets his hat on his head, and heads out in his hand-me-down

shirt and overalls.

Your eyes get used to the night after a few minutes.

You can't see anything beyond the light though, and if you do try, you'll lose your night eyes.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano pulls out a long-stick match

Nephi is now holding.

A long stick match.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano keeps it in his right hand, holding his gun in his left.

The match remains unlit.

Play a trombone solo(From Crystal Saint Claire):

You know the one(From Crystal Saint Claire):

(doot doot doot)

Nephi "Longiron" Delano uses the matchbox to light it.

It lights on the first try.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano carries it in his off hand, keeping his rifle over his shoulder with the other,

realizing that he should probably pick up a lantern sometime.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano walks towards the lantern

Which I actually cannot see.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Little to the right and further up.

""...Ain't this town ever heard of streetlights..."
Said Nephi

You did see some streetlights on your way in.

Funny that they aren't lit now.

Must be running low on oil or something.

Couple more feet to the right, the lantern is right there.

There's something next to it.

Glinting in the light.

Must be metal.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks at what's out here.

Looks like the hilt of a knife stuck into the ground.

Looks like a good knife too.

Right next to the lantern.

What do you do Mormon boy?

Nephi "Longiron" Delano leans down to look at the knife handle

"...Why'd someone go stabbin the ground?"
Said Nephi

Looks like a good Bowie knife. Custom handle of red and black stone. Smooth to the

touch. nice work.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano raises a curious eyebrow.

"Who the..."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano starts to get suspicious.

A gust of wind blows through and the lantern goes out, so does the match.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano stands a little back, and-

Leaving Nephi in the dark.

"...Oh no."
Said Nephi

Better get that thing relit.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano drops what's left of the match and pulls out a new one, grabbing the lantern.

"No no no no no no..."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano pulls out another match and attempts to light it.

First try, yet again.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano tries to relight the lantern

"..."
Said Nephi

"Long time."
Said The

Nephi "Longiron" Delano just looks.

"No see."
Said The

"...You."
Said Nephi

The Pale Rider smiles at Nephi with teeth white as his skin.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano fumbles around with the lantern, trying to get it into a way he could grip it while

also holding onto his rifle, fukken quaking in his shoes.

"Y-you can't be here."
Said Nephi

"You ain't real!"

"I be, wherever I have want to be."
Said The

The Pale Rider walks forward and takes the knife out of Nephi's hands.

"S-stay back!"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano jumps back the moment he takes the knife, gun jumping around like a rabbit in

his hands.

"I-I don't need savin this time. You're just a b-b-big g-g-ghost!"
Said Nephi

The Pale Rider holds the blade in his left hand and grinds the tip of it into his right palm. He must have

tough skin, because the knife doesn't go through.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has completely frozen otherwise his fingers seemingly refusing to pull the

"Don't know about that."
Said The

"Let me see that rifle of yours."

"Y-y-you're gonna... Gonna stay away from my friends."
Said Nephi

"N-no dice, pale man."

"I said."
Said The

"Let. Me. See."

"Be rude to refuse an old friend."

"You ain't a friend! You're some badness from an old dream!"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano takes another step back. Still his fingers refuse to pull the trigger.

The Pale Rider advances. His bulk is unnatural in its immensity, and its grace.

Is this... is this Inyanga?(From Poage):

"You're not taking my friends from me. Not again."
Said Nephi

Is it?(To Poage):

I THOUGHT WHAT WE HAD WAS SPECIAL(From Poage):

"I'M NOT GONNA BE LEFT ALONE AGAIN!"
Said Nephi

"YOU HEAD RIGHT BACK TO WHATEVER PIT YOU CRAWLED OUTTA, Y'HEAR?"

The Pale Rider grips the end of the rifle with one huge hand and drags it out of Nephi's hands.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano tries to resist!

We don't have an image. He's big. He's pale. Doesn't have a cigar, though. And the knife is an

Roll Strength?Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

The Pale Rider:

The Pale Rider:

then yes(From Rockett Rimjob):

she'd look to see what the hell's going on, and then book it outside(From Rockett Rimjob):

your call how long it takes her to get out there(From Rockett Rimjob):

And I can't tell if that's a beard, or a shadow.(From Poage):

The Pale Rider tears the rifle out of Nephi's hand like he isn't even there. He holds it by the middle, nice

and steady. The knife in his right hand flits up and begins carving something into the wood stock.

"That's my old man's gun! Don't you dare!"
Said Nephi

"D-doesn't matter that the old man's not here, I'm older now!"

"Stronger than I ever b-been!"

"Strong enough?"
Said The

Nephi "Longiron" Delano keeps saying, but with no gun to back it up.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano seems just inches from crumbling now.

The Pale Rider taps the wood shavings off the gun and hands it back to Nephi.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano takes it and holds it like a child

"Nephi what'n sam hell are you--"
Said Rockett

The Pale Rider turns and walks off into the night with the lantern.

"NO!"
Said Nephi

Rockett Rimjob has her derringer out.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano runs to rockett and fukken tries to push her away

"He's- Oh god!"

"Just run!"

You can see a pale head bobbing out in the dark.

Rockett Rimjob has quite disshevelled clothes, and looks like she just rolled out of bed.

Do you shoot Rockett?

"There's alot you deserve, but not what he's gonna do to ya!"
Said Nephi

"We need to go, now!"

He moved a little too fast for me to roll in time where he'd actually be in range.Rockett Rimjob:

Would Rockett still try for a shot on this mystery individual?

How far away is he?Rockett Rimjob:

Not too far.

In six spaces.

Shouldn't be too hard a shot.

Oh. Then sure.Rockett Rimjob:

Roll it.

you got something to say nebRockett Rimjob:

"Rockett, I don't want you to-"
Said Nephi

Rockett Rimjob:+07+09+0704

Nephi "Longiron" Delano tries to get out before she shoots, but isn't fast enough

BANGRockett Rimjob:

Let's see.

Oh dear.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Roll for damage.

"..."
Said Nephi

You hear the bullet thunk into something.

No scream.

No grunt.

"..."
Said Nephi

Not even a whimper.

"God forgive me."
Said Nephi

The sound of the gunshot fades into the black of the night.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano grabs Rockett and fukken pulls her away as fast as he can.

The bobbing white head merges with the shadows.

"What the fuck was that, jackass?"
Said Rockett

"JUST RUN"
Said Nephi

"BEFORE HE COMES BACK"

Rockett Rimjob swats his arm away and starts jogging as she slips another bullet back into her gun.

"Not til- Not til we're in the light!"
Said Nephi

"Light. Light!"

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has a REALLY crazy look in his eyes.

"Lightlightlightlightlightlight"
Said Nephi

"Ah'm gonna fuckin' lay you out for makin' me panic like this you shithead!"
Said Rockett

"He's the reason my friends're gone!"
Said Nephi

"...It's cuz of him..."

Nephi and Rockett make it back to the saloon.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano ran there as fast as he could, making sure Rockett came with.

Nephi still has the rifle gripped in a white knuckled hand.

"Light. Light light light. Thank GOD."
Said Nephi

"Boy what tha fuck were you thinkin' goin' out there in tha middle of tha night?"
Said Rockett

"...Just as long as the lights stay on..."Nephi "Longiron" Delano:0000

Nephi "Longiron" Delano curls up in the fetal position, gun in hand, rocking back and forth.

"He can't be here. Not again. Not again. Not again."
Said Nephi

"..."
Said Rockett

"Nonononononononon."
Said Nephi

Rockett Rimjob fucking drags Nephi to his room

Nephi "Longiron" Delano goes limp when she does.

This probably looks really bad.Rockett Rimjob:

Rockett dragging him to his room while he's curled up and mumbling.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has a thousand-yard stare by this point.

"Had a little bit too much of good drink or good company, that boy." Mutters one

behatted cowpoke as the two pass.

Whitney has unlocked Crystal's Tragic Backstory...(From Poage):

And we're comparing notes~!(From Poage):

noice(To Poage):

Anything new you can tell me?(From Poage):

Well now he's got Rockett panicked and worried. Doesn't look like she'll be sleeping much

Rockett Rimjob:

"...Y' shit..."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano calms down a bit more when back in his room, but is still shaking in the most

abject of terror, only some strange nerves of steel keeping him from getting the hell outta Dodge.

Nephi, might want to take a look at the damage done to the rifle.

You've got enough for now.(To Poage):

Got it~!(From Poage):

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks at what was carved into it, eventually.

"...M'sorry pop. I won't let him have it again."
Said Nephi

It would take some prying to get repressed memories out of their bolt holes.(To Poage):

"..."
Said Nephi

"He shouldn't be here... He can't..."

Like... Whitney trying to heal Crystal of the mental trauma caused by whatever tore her feety

bottoms off?

(From Poage):

"I... Ugh."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano slooowly falls over, onto the bed or chair or whatever, slumping.

I mean talking about things and actually getting Crystal to say something.(To Poage):

"...Where are you now, old rider..."
Said Nephi

Got it. Because right now... Crystal told Whitney quite a bit. Most of what she can remember.(From Poage):

"..."
Said Rockett

"Ah'm gonna ask you in tha mornin' when yer more coherent than a drunken infant."

Got it.(To Poage):

Nephi "Longiron" Delano stays like that for several long minutes, before he eventually starts to return to

his normal self, though still more than a little shaken.

"...Rockett? You..."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano only seems to register her presence now.

"...You... You shouldn't have..."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano sighs.

"But you did, and... I guess..."
Said Nephi

"Yer one ta fuckin' talk."
Said Rockett

"Mister Ah'm gonna walk out there at night like a jackass."

"...Aww. You do care~"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano manages a tiny smile before it fades back into the lingering look of terror, as his

eyes constantly dart to all the lights in the room, and the entrances.

"Who was that?"
Said Rockett

"No cryptic nonsense."

"Don't know. He never was polite enough to give me his name."
Said Nephi

"...I called him the Pale Rider. Because he rode a black horse."

"And because... Y'know. Tall giant, white as milk."

"Why's he care about you?Rockett Rimjob:

"...He's been followin me since I was 10."
Said Nephi

"Why?"
Said Rockett

"...Don't know. Maybe it was something mama did."
Said Nephi

"She knew all kinds of things about... Weirdness, in the world."

Dagnabbit boy let me work.(To Scotty):

"...But it was the night of the quake the first time he showed up."
Said Nephi

"...Second time when my old fellows and I got... Separarted."

"Still don't got any idea what happened to them."

"....But I'm pretty sure he killed them."

"It was too dark to see, but I heard screams."

"...Screams. So many..."

(To GM) rolling 2d8!!+1d4!!+4d12!!+3d6!!

"...He can't be back. Not now."
Said Nephi

"..."
Said Rockett

"Not fucking now..."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano curls up again.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano rocks back and forth.

"But... Maybe..."
Said Nephi

"Someone drove him off, the first time. Another rider."

"Never saw him again. But he was different, and he told me what to do."

Rockett makes a good thirty three bucks from being the best darn ho that's ever raked. One of her

especially endowed clients slips her a little bit extra, bringing the total up to fifty bucks.

(To Scotty):

"...I thought it was just a dream, until he showed up again..."
Said Nephi

"...And this is the third time..."

Excellent.(From Rockett Rimjob):

"...boy, you need ta get an exorcist."
Said Rockett

"...You gotta get out of here. You can't tell anyone you saw him."
Said Nephi

"He might come for you next."

"Boy, you need to get an exorcist."
Said Rockett

"Don't you get it?"
Said Nephi

"I heard you shoot. You think I haven't tried shooting him before?"

"Why can't I go tell a damn priest?"
Said Rockett

"You want to try telling a priest about all that?"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:0000000000

"..."
Said Rockett

"Bout giant naked milk-white men who laugh off bullets?"
Said Nephi

"They'll throw you in an asylum."

He actually did have a shirt.

And pants.

"...Though he did have a shirt this time."
Said Nephi

"You saw him. That means he's real."

"...Which means I can kill him."

"...It's just a trick of findin out how."

"..."
Said Rockett

"...Ah wanna fuckin' throttle you right now damn it."

"For what?"
Said Nephi

"Not because I'm crazy, because that'd be admitting that yer crazy too."

"Not because I'm a coward, because you saw about how good normal bullets work on 'im."

"Unless you're just one of those really dirty ones that get off to it."

"I heard bout some weird stuff that goes on in brothels."

"For not tellin' us shit about this before, an' waltzin' outside in tha dead of night like it was

Rockett Rimjob:

"Rockett."
Said Nephi

"Imagine I told you."

"How am I supposed to start, "Oh by the way there's this jolly white giant who likes to show up every few years of

my life and kill slash drive off all my friends and leave me stumbling in the dark, alone?"

"...by startin' with, "Oh by the way, there's this jolly white giant who likes to show up every few

years of my life and kill or drive off all my friends and leave me stumbling in the dark, alone?"

Rockett Rimjob:

"Alone and with soiled pants"
Said Nephi

"Mighta been an overshare."

"I don't know what gets him to show up. But it wasn't long after I told my friends about what happened that he

"...I don't want'ta even think about it."
Said Nephi

"..."
Said Rockett

"Christ almighty Nephi yer a few barrels short of a Gatling..."

Rockett Rimjob facepalms.

"Well, it didn't help them any!"
Said Nephi

"And WHAT, I'm supposed to spend all my time quakin in my boots?"

"I'd rather get out and do something. Get to be a better shot."

"Work harder. Do the right... Right thing."

"...But right now. I'm just gonna..."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is clearly losing the adrenaline and crashing hard.

"...I messed up. I froze. I froze..."
Said Nephi

"No fight or flight, I just..."

"I froze."

"..."
Said Rockett

"Get some damn sleep."

"Ah'm gonna think about just what the hell Ah've gotten into."

Rockett Rimjob walks out the door to his room.

"..."
Said Nephi

"I'm sorry..."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano passes out.

Rockett Rimjob closes the door behind her.

Rockett Rimjob heads back down to the bar for a few more drinks.

Bartender nods his head to Rockett as she comes back down. The bar is empty, save for her.

"...Whadaya got that passes fer whiskey here?"
Said Rockett

"Whiskey."
Said Bartender

"Sometimes with whiskey flavoring."

"Want some?"

"Please."
Said Rockett

would this be a good time to introduce Natasha lol(From Yuppie b.):

Maybe wait till we're in the middle of a proper session.(To Yuppie b.):

So she can roll up in her phat moneymobile.(To Yuppie b.):

Bartender sets a bottle down next to Rockett's hand. It has no label on it, but the liquid is amber.

Bartender sets a glass with three hunks of ice in it next to that.

yes(From Yuppie b.):

Bartender pours her a measure.

"Man problems?"
Said Bartender

Rockett Rimjob looks at the glass.

Rockett Rimjob grabs it and sighs. "Naw. Jus'... bad news, is all," she says quietly.

"Talk? Or help no to?"
Said Bartender

"Mighta gotten involved inta somethin' Ah really shouldn't've."
Said Rockett

"But nah. Ah jus' need a drink."

"Business better t'day?"

"Mmmm."
Said Bartender

"Business good as always."

"Thanks for using the glass."

Bartender rests his back against the other side of the bar. He crosses one arm over his midsection as the

other sets to tugging at his mustache.

"Reckon folks'll start pourin' in tomorrow since Ah'm in town. Ah'll be around fer most of tha day,

Ah reckon -- got some detective work ta do, an' Ah could use some cash besides."

Rockett Rimjob:

"Good."
Said Bartender

"Thanks for the business."

"Detective work?"

"Deeeetective work."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob sips from her glass.

Bartender nods the nod of a sage.

"Buddy got murdered couple months back. Few more even longer ago."
Said Rockett

"Tryin'a find who dunnit."

"Mmmm."
Said Bartender

"Gallows sang a similar tune before he left."

"We're after tha same guy, apparently."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob takes another sip.

"Take it tha chances of Gallows comin' back are slim an' none, an' slim jus' left town on a gimpy

Rockett Rimjob:

"Good man."
Said Bartender

"Gets a notion in his head."
Said Bartender

"Can't stop him."

"Hell nor high water."

"Sounds about right."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob sighs

"Sandwich?"
Said Bartender

"What'cha got?"
Said Rockett

"Steak."
Said Bartender

"Little cheap."

"Still good."

"Still got a couple breasts in the larder."

PfffffffffffffffftNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is busy being asleep

"Show me yer breasts an' Ah'll show ya mine."
Said Rockett

Nephi TEARS ASS in his sleep.Bartender:

"Bar's pretty empty."
Said Rockett

"..."
Said Bartender

Bartender walks through the doors to the kitchen. Sounds of sizzling meat and the nose tingling aroma of

spice drift through to Rockett in a minute or two.

Rockett Rimjob can't help but smile.

Bartender walks back into the room with a plate in his left hand and a few new stains drying on his apron.

He sets the plate down next to Rockett's glass of whiskey.

Bartender crouches down and scrabbles under the bar. He emerges with a bottle of ketchup, spicy

She takes a gander at the food in front of her, sliding all of the condiments away for the moment.Rockett Rimjob:

Looks to be two fresh fried chicken breasts between two fresh fried buns. Little grease

still on them. There is a sweet herby smell about it.

Rockett Rimjob seems to be pleased with this and the smell. "Not bad. S'pose a deal's a deal."

Rockett Rimjob reaches up and undoes the first few buttons of her corset, and lets her dress slip down off

of her arms. Everything above her belly button is plain for the world to see.

Rockett Rimjob grabs the salt, and trickles a little bit on the cooked breasts.

Wonderful Cowboy Land puts one hand on the bar to steady himself.

Bartender also puts one hand on the bar to steady himself.

"Rumors are true."
Said Bartender

Rockett Rimjob chuckles a bit, grabbing her fork and prodding at her dish.

"Like what ya see?"
Said Rockett

"Mmmm."
Said Bartender

"Got a pair of aces."

Rockett Rimjob takes a bite of chicken, chewing slowly and acting a little... -too- pleased by the taste.

"Mmm..."
Said Rockett

Bartender leans back and takes in the sight. His mustache twitches up a little in what might be a grin.

"Not bad... Been a while since Ah've had a decent meal like this."
Said Rockett

"Getting a little hungry maself."
Said Bartender

"That so?"
Said Rockett

"Such an appetizing display."
Said Bartender

"Only natural."

"Well. Glad it's nice. But that's all it is, hun."
Said Rockett

"An appetizer," she says, taking another big bite of her chicken. She shakes her body a bit, giving her mounds a

little jiggle.

"And the main course?"
Said Bartender

"Depends what you want on yer entree."
Said Rockett

"Split peach?"
Said Bartender

"Hm... Depends on what ya wanna do fer dessert."
Said Rockett

"Thinking something with cream filling."
Said Bartender

"Hmm... that ain't real cheap. Not at all."
Said Rockett

"You sure you can afford that?"

"I'm a man of wealth and taste."
Said Bartender

"Man'a taste, huh? Take it you don't want none of that rowdy ramblin' business, then. You seem

like you want a passion treat."

Rockett Rimjob:

Rockett Rimjob takes another bite.

"Don't know, might be a man of rough taste."
Said Bartender

Rockett Rimjob raises her brows. "Well. Price depends on a few things, sweetie. Normally folks jus' want

me ta get a little grabby, maybe taste their cookin'. This, though... don't come 'round as often."

Rockett Rimjob:

"Usually Ah ask fer... somewhere 'round fifty, fer somethin' like that. Full score, rough an' ready, real hands-on

stuff. You, though, Ah might settle fer thirty-five, since this chicken tastes real good."

"You gimme tha full fifty, an' Ah'll stick around a while longer. Show you tha best, give you some pointers. Bump it

ta seventy-five, you got a couple rounds ta do what ya wanna do. You give me five score, an' Ah won't leave 'til

"Ridin' tha smoothest dirt road you'll ever ride's extra. Replace any clothes ya rip, pay fer any medical bills or

leave bruises, 's bad fer business."

Persuasion roll.Bartender:

Rockett Rimjob:

Bartender reaches into his apron pocket and takes out a wad of bills. He counts a few out without looking

at them, then slides them across the table.

Rockett Rimjob grabs the bills and gives it a looksie.

Five tens.

Rockett Rimjob slides the tens right into her dress, below her right pillow.

"Sure thing. Meetin' in mah room? Or d'you wanna take this back ta yer bed?"
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob takes another bite of her chicken.

"I'll lock up here after you're done."

Rockett Rimjob starts eating a little faster, and nods once.

"Sure thing."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob hurries up, eats the last few bites, and slides the plate to the bartender.

Bartender takes the plate and disappears with it to the kitchen. He returns and replaces the condiments

under the bar.

"Finish your drink?"
Said Bartender

"Yes sir."
Said Rockett

"You ready ta tango?"

Rockett Rimjob stands up off of her stool.

Bartender sets one hand down on the bar and swings himself over.

"Allowed to get handsy?"

"You can grab as much as you like."
Said Rockett

Bartender smacks his hand into Rockett's rump just hard enough to sting. He leaves it there, clutching the

"Lead the way, wayward woman."
Said Bartender

"--HellOOo, mister Randy...!"
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob smiles wide, and makes her way back up to her room.

Bartender follows Rockett. There is definite upturn to his mustache now, and a hint of some white teeth.

Things ensue.Rockett Rimjob:

"Sacks seems to like you."
Said Alexander

Rockett Rimjob scratches behind his ears. "That he does. Cute little fella."

"He always this friendly?"
Said Rockett

"Not usually. Nephi, for example."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald looks at the dog.

"...He thinks he's patronizing."
Said Alexander

"Huh."
Said Rockett

"So's he."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald sits down on a nearby seat, just silently looking at Rockett and the dog.

Sacks lazily wags his tail.

"So. How's work been treatin' y'all lately? Haven't ran inta too much trouble, Ah hope."
Said Rockett

"Been silent since we got to Kansas."
Said Alexander

"Before that bandits tried to hijack our train."

"Oh, that sounds like fun."
Said Rockett

"Take it y'all took care'a that mess?"

"Sure did- the others more than me."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald lightly touches the revolver on his holster.

"Not as effective in long ranges."
Said Alexander

Rockett Rimjob nods once. "They seem like folks that don't want nothin' ta do with squabbles."

"Ah don't mind gettin' right into tha action. Up close an' personal."
Said Rockett

"Partly 'cause that's where Ah'm best. Partly 'cause mah eyes aren't that great."

"... That explains the Derringer."
Said Alexander

"Never seen anything like it. Not even back in New York."

"'Cause there ain't nothin' like it. Custom made. Real nice."
Said Rockett

"But yeah. Rifle wouldn't do me much good if Ah can't see more'n ten paces front 'f mah face, yeah?"

"... Hum. You don't show it."
Said Alexander

"Thought about investing in glasses? Sounds like you'd need those."

"Ah used ta have a pair. Got smashed in a bar fight. Realized folks looked at me more when Ah

didn't have 'em on, so Ah left 'em off."

Rockett Rimjob:

"Might get a pair some time down tha road, but Ah can work jus' fine without 'em."

"Fair enough.Alexander Hauswald:

Don't see why glasses would make you less pretty."

Alexander Hauswald is as stoic as ever when he says that.

"Ah think it's 'cause it messes with mah eyes. Makes 'em look way too big fer mah face. Might

block part 'f mah cheeks, too."

Rockett Rimjob:

"Whatever tha case."

"...How big do your lenses need to beAlexander Hauswald:

"Y'seen tha bottoms of some'a them soda bottles?"
Said Rockett

"..Alexander Hauswald:

"...How do you walk around like that?"

"Ah can make things out when they're pretty close. Ain't too hard ta work with. Never got in tha

way of nothin' -- Ah ain't blind."

Rockett Rimjob:

"Like Ah can make out yer face real well from about here. Ah can see Scraps' discolored gums, too."

"You were a bunch more steps back, though... bets are off."

"...Scraps?"
Said Alexander

"...Sacks. Sorry."
Said Rockett

"Had a pooch named Scraps back home."

"Kinda look alike."

"... Where're you from, again?"
Said Alexander

"Oregon."
Said Rockett

(my usa geography is shit- is it Union or Confederacy territory?)Alexander Hauswald:

Alexander Hauswald cracks a smile. You think.

"New York. What brought you here?"
Said Alexander

"Bookin' it from home, first off. Then Ah just... kept walkin'. 'Til Ah found Boston. Then Ah started

walkin' back."

Rockett Rimjob:

"Ain't really stopped wanderin' since. It's sorta like goin' on tour, 'cept tha end's indefinite."

"Huh. Mind if I ask what made you leave home?"
Said Alexander

"Mah folks."
Said Rockett

"Take it you didn't hear that ruckus in tha bar last night, then."

Rockett Rimjob sighs quietly.

"Afraid not. Was..Alexander Hauswald:

Out. Looking."

"Well. Ah don't like goin' inta detail, so Ah ain't gonna tell ya more than ya need ta know."
Said Rockett

"The fact you're telling is trusting enough."
Said Alexander

"Pa was a real religious nut. An' an asshole. Real fond of tha belt. With tha buckle. Ma was a

Rockett Rimjob:

"Ah ended up leavin'."

"Turns out Ah was followed."

Rockett Rimjob starts digging in her backpack for something.

(gimme a sec)Alexander Hauswald:

"...They tracked you down all the way here?"
Said Alexander

"Apparent-fuckin'-ly."
Said Rockett

"Ah was havin' a nice chat with Cass when Whitney showed up."

"...Guessing they weren't proud."
Said Alexander

"Took 'er a whole two seconds ta pull Jesus on me again, jus' like she used to."
Said Rockett

"...Wait. What?"
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald forrows his brows.

"I'm... I think I misheard?"
Said Alexander

"No, no, ya didn't."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob sighs, pulling out a cigar, a match, and urgently starts trying to light the damn thing.

"Whitney's your...?"
Said Alexander

"Uh-huh."
Said Rockett

"...Oh."
Said Alexander

"...Never would've thought."

"Ah've been tryin' ta ferget."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob puffs rudely from her cigar, smoke wafting around the small cabin. She reaches for the

window and cracks it open.

"...Surprised you still decided to tag along."
Said Alexander

"Care more about mah dead friends'n Ah do mah tree ogre of a sister, turns out."
Said Rockett

"If dealin' with her presence fer a few days means findin' out who shot Jones, an' handin' out some justice, well..."

"Reckon Ah got an obligation."

"...I'm sorry. I suppose."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald sighs.

"Wish I could say I understand you."
Said Alexander

Rockett Rimjob shrugs. "Ain't none your fault. Not like you coulda done nothin'."

"Whadaya mean?"
Said Rockett

"I... don't know the things you went through."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald shrugs, sighing.

"Never had these kinda problems with Thomas."
Said Alexander

"Ah."
Said Rockett

"You weren't in an Adventist household, then, Ah take it."

Rockett Rimjob lets out a light sigh, closing her eyes for a moment and enjoying her cigar.

"Religion wasn't a big thing for me, no."
Said Alexander

"Religion usually ain't that bad a thing. But if you thought Catholics were eager ta use Jesus as

an excuse ta lash, huh..."

Rockett Rimjob:

Rockett Rimjob shakes her head.

"...I thought Jesus wasn't a whipping man."
Said Alexander

"One woulda thought so, yeah..."
Said Rockett

"Folks jus' loooove ta make excuses. Twist the Lord's name ta suit what they want. Whatever sufferin' they wanna

dish out."

"..."
Said Alexander

"Buncha self-righteous, malleable hoo-hah if you ask me. This world needs better preachers."
Said Rockett

Alexander Hauswald hesitantly reaches over, putting his hand on her shoulder.

Rockett Rimjob tenses up a bit and opens her eyes.

"Huh?"
Said Rockett

"I'm..."
Said Alexander

"I'm not good at this kind of stuff. Sorry."

Alexander Hauswald moves his hand away.

"...don't worry. Ah've had plenny 'f time ta get over it."
Said Rockett

"Moved on well enough, Ah reckon."

"Whitney comin' back ta throw tha Bible at me jus' opened some old wounds."

"So I guess we won't see much of you when we're done."
Said Alexander

"Reckon not. Not unless you try'n catch me on tour."
Said Rockett

"Shame."
Said Alexander

"You're a pleasant enough person."

"Aww. Is tha big gruff macho man gonna miss little ol' me..?"
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob smirks a little, at that.

Alexander Hauswald cracks another hypothetical smile.

"Maybe."
Said Alexander

"I know Sacks will."

Rockett Rimjob scratches under Sacks' chin.

"Ah'm sure you'll be sick'a me by tha time we're through, though. People only tend ta enjoy mah

company for..."

Rockett Rimjob:

"...anywhere between twenny minutes an' thirty seconds."

"...We'll see. I'm sure there's more to you than what's under the dress."
Said Alexander

"Somethin' there. Lot of it was beaten outta me, though, so don't hold ye rbreath."
Said Rockett

"Time will tell. Don't think we'll be done in a day.Alexander Hauswald:

"Oh hell naw. Way this guy's been goin' around without even a hint of who he is or what the hell

his yearnin' is..."

Rockett Rimjob:

"Ah think we're gonna be here a while."

"Exactly. You're not getting away that easily."
Said Alexander

"Don't get any bright ahdeas 'bout holdin' me hostage though."
Said Rockett

"Ah'm a free bird. Not sure Ah could settle down fer long."

"Longest Ah ever spent in one place since Ah left home was a couple weeks."

"Got a feeling we won't be staying in one place for too long, either. Not me, at least."
Said Alexander

"Ah was hopin' such."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob reaches up and ashes her cigar out the window.

"Don't know if I'll stick to being a marshall for too long, really."
Said Alexander

"It's a decent job. Ya move around a lot, keeps ya on yer toes, no shortage of excitement. Pay's

pretty decent, too."

Rockett Rimjob:

"Ah might be a bit of a specialist, though, so it might not be tha same fer you pokes."

"I know. Money's not the problem."
Said Alexander

"I just want to find my brother and head home."

"...Hm."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob looks down to the floor.

"...Wish Ah could help."
Said Rockett

"You got kind words and the intention. That's all I need."
Said Alexander

Rockett Rimjob shrugs. "Good intentions pave tha way ta hell. Don't get too caught up."

"S'long as I get my job done. I'd go over and sit in the devil's throne if it helps me."
Said Alexander

"Fair enough."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob looks down at her stogie.

"...How many of those do you even smoke?"
Said Alexander

"..."
Said Rockett

"Usually only once in a while. Less Ah'm stressed."

"And you're very stressed, i take it."
Said Alexander

"...Thanks for the chat, by the way."

"If I had to listen to Nephi for a bit more I think I'd go insane."

"Yeah. Stressed is a way ta put it. An'... yeah. Chattin's nice."
Said Rockett

"Always had tha gift'a gab, Ah did."

"...Just don't worry. Everything will be alright."
Said Alexander

"Ah'm still gonna worry. But... y'all seem like ya got some decent heads on yer shoulders. Ah

think we're on a good track."

Rockett Rimjob:

"Mind if Ah catch some shut-eye 'fore we get ta Dodge?"

"Think I will too. Good night, Rockett."
Said Alexander

Rockett Rimjob rests her head and closes her eyes, one of her hands resting on Sacks' head.

(And I suppose we end here?)Alexander Hauswald:

(This was fun!)Alexander Hauswald:

yes it was!Rockett Rimjob:

Seeya later, man!Alexander Hauswald:

I amScotty:

taco bell

You should take me there again

ALRIGHT.

All we need is Nev.

all you need isScotty:

NEV NEV NEV

Nev is all you need.

I'll be typing the intro while Nev gets here.

Rockett and Nephi are wandering around the town as night turns into dark. They have

not yet gone back to the saloon to rest and had their strange encounter with the pale man. They are conducting

their investigations into Dodge. It consists largely of walking around waiting for something obvious to fall into their

laps since Nephi is about as sharp as wet dirt and Rockett's eyes don't work too good. However, they are just

lucky enough that something interesting happens by.

A...what do you call it? Steam wagon? It seems inaccurate for this vehicle. This thing is not a wagon, it is a piece

of art with wheels. It rolls into town with its equally opulent appearing occupant. Greenbacks actually float out of

the back of the thing as it skids to a halt right outside town hall, scaring every horse within a mile.

That's your cue.(To Yuppie b.):

You're here on behalf of the rail company to meet with a few other reps to discuss a pressing

issue on the brothel side of things. Profits have been down low, and you think you know why...

(To Yuppie b.):

Scotty looks up at the wagon with a smile as it approaches to a halt.

The door to this strange metal wagon is opened and from it's depths stepped a woman of

almost ethereal beauty. With a loud clack her foot found the ground below. Dressed in a large white overcoat and

wielding an opulent cane in her gloved hands, the silver haired woman flashed the world a wicked, almost

predatory grin. Her eyes alight with a sharp, dangerous spark that bled into her confident stride.

Natasha Minayeva :

Welcome.

To memes.

Rockett Rimjob places her hands on her hips and stands adease, in her typical skimpy garments.

Clack clack clackNatasha Minayeva :

Natasha Minayeva stops

Is somewhereNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Natasha Minayeva places her hand on the hilt of her cane and turns her head to the whore

"Who the fuck are you and why do you look so familiar?"
Said Natasha

"Rockett, what am i lookin at right now?"
Said Nephi

"Ah got no ahdea," she says to the mystery woman. "You look at a lotta sinful photo albums?"
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob glances at Nephi and shrugs.

"Because it looks like a steam wagon. With acrual money coming out of it."
Said Nephi

Natasha Minayeva narrows her eyes and flashes her teeth. "Da. I know exactly who you are. I saw you on

the way..."

"Yer muffler needs replacement."
Said Nephi

"Как чудесно! I was actually here because of you."
Said Natasha

"They really aint supposed to be THAT loud."
Said Nephi

It isn't actually Rockett that's the problem.(To Yuppie b.):

"Rockett hunter, are ya?"
Said she

It's with one of the other reps.(To Yuppie b.):

"Does it look like I am talking to you?"
Said Natasha

"A-"
Said Nephi

"Da! I was looking for a little relief"
Said Natasha

Something about a Club 99 being run by someone called Rickert.(To Yuppie b.):

Nephi "Longiron" Delano raises finger

Nephi "Longiron" Delano lowrrs it.

"What do you want?"
Said Natasha

"Can't you see I am talking to lady?"

"...Have fun, shes a real peach."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano gets out of the way of the angry lady

"If I gave peach right now would you shove in stupid face so I can have peaceful

Natasha Minayeva :

"There we go..."

"You mean a peach-ful conversation?"
Said Rockett

"..."
Said Natasha

Rockett Rimjob grins.

""Hahaha!"
Said Natasha

Natasha Minayeva laughs a great, hearty laugh!

"Somethin' tells me a couple peaches 're gonna be full by tha end of this."
Said Rockett

"Oh God...I gotta tell Aperta about this..."
Said Natasha

"That was a good one."

"Rockett Rimjob, whore extraordinaire an' master of puns, at yer service."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob bows.

"Your name is garish and to the point. I like it. I am familar with work...and is good you are

Natasha Minayeva :

Natasha Minayeva removes her glove

Natasha Minayeva extends her hand

"Natasha Minayeva"
Said Natasha

Rockett Rimjob reaches out and gives it a firm shake.

"Don't tell me Ah'm tha only reason you came all tha way out to tha middle'a nowhere..."
Said Rockett

Natasha Minayeva matches her in firmness...not something you could say often

"No no no...though it does have something to do with Brothel. I have...what you call diverse

Natasha Minayeva :

"Someone has been cutting into business. Someone called..."Rickert" at a club 99."

"Sound familar?"

"Hm?"
Said Rockett

"Do you know a Rickert?"
Said Natasha

"They sound like cheap rip off."

"I don't much care for cheap. Or being ripped off."

You've heard whisperings of this. Rickert is the fellow that works the assets for Dixie Rails' whores.(To Scotty):

"...Actually, you got a point. Ah've heard that name."
Said Rockett

"Chinese bootleg Rockett, apparently."

"I am here to discuss problem with boring people. Then I will decide how I will deal with

problem myself."

Natasha Minayeva :

"...you. Man." She suddenly turns to Nephi.

Natasha Minayeva points her finger at him

"Eep!"
Said Nephi

"Now that I think about it...you seem familar."
Said Natasha

jumpsNephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Do I know you?"
Said Natasha

Be back in a tick

"Er, ah dunno. Maybe?"
Said Nephi

"You might know some of my family. They get around."

"...you look like employee of mine..."
Said Natasha

"...You dont happen to work for the railroads, do ya?"
Said Nephi

"Da. I am branch director of United Pacific Railroad."
Said Natasha

"I am here to lay tracks, get laid, and make lots of cash in process."

"The American dream."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Real beefy fella, looks like he eats weights for breakfast?"

"Likes to bust outta shirts for laughs?"

into town hall and pretend to be interested in what stupid people have to say."

Natasha Minayeva :

"Well if yer lookin for dealin with stupid, im yer man!"
Said Nephi

"...wait that came out wrong. Lemme try again."

Sounds like this is attack on brand name. Would like to discuss possible work opportunity?"

Natasha Minayeva :

"You come, you listen, we blow off steam...either way you leave with money."

"Sounds like a fair deal ta me~!"
Said Rockett

"Quick question...you are not afraid of heights are you miss Rockett?"
Said Natasha

"Ah've climbed mountains before."
Said Rockett

"Have you ever been on airship before?"
Said Natasha

"..."
Said Rockett

"'Scuse me?"

Rockett Rimjob blinks.

"...why you gotta be this way, rockett..."
Said Nephi

"Because God an' mah family abandoned me, Nephi,"
Said she

"...Fai'nuff."
Said Nephi

"...you have never seen?"
Said She

"Can't say Ah have, miss."
Said Rockett

"It aint all that. Pa used to show me round in his autogyro.cNephi "
Said Longiron

"Tonight I will show you best fucking view in world."
Said Natasha

"Do you do multiple partners?"

"Yes ma'am. Who might have tha pleasure?"
Said Rockett

"...welp thats me out have fun rockett I'll be here if ya need me."
Said Nephi

"Adios, Nephi."
Said Rockett

"...yew aint gonna stop me?"
Said Nephi

"Less you wanna join in."
Said Rockett

"Figgered..."
Said Nephi

Rockett Rimjob smiles wickedly.

be waiting in town hall.

(To Yuppie b.):

"Why not?"
Said Natasha

"You are not bad looking man."

"He's a mormon boy."
Said Rockett

Takes in a deep breathNephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Does he still have penis?"
Said Natasha

"I-"
Said Nephi

"Oh no, he's packin' some heat."
Said Rockett

"Jus' real religious."

"Darn tootin i d-"
Said Nephi

"Man is man. Mormon or not."
Said Natasha

"But if you would rather be with Jesus, that is fine."

"Rockett dammit will yew lemme get a word in edgewise without talkin bout mah man

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Never."
Said Rockett

Natasha Minayeva reaches into her pocket

Natasha Minayeva produces a gold pocket watch

Natasha Minayeva clicks it open, looks at the time, and sighs

"Fuck."
Said Natasha

"Ugh. I was about to say. We'd probably be able to get a good lay of the land and i

have way better eyes'n you."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"I am late. Can not keep stuffy men waiting forever...if you will be my guest tonight you may

stay by steam wagon."

Natasha Minayeva :

"If you want to come mormon boy...option is there~"

"I hope you screw better than Russian Orthodox."

"...Like david into the lion's den..."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano sighs

Natasha Minayeva chuckles like mad

"Anyways...have places to be. Pleasure to meet you all. Will see you..." She says, pointing

her finger at Rockett with a grin. "Later."

Natasha Minayeva :

Natasha Minayeva places the glove back on her hand

"Dangit, Rockett, one'a yew was bad enough."
Said Nephi

"Of course. Ah'll see you t'night, honey doll~" she coos, nodding at Natasha and tipping her

Rockett Rimjob:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano says, as Natasha heads off.

"Dasvidaniya~"
Said She

Natasha disappears through the doors of town hall. It doesn't look like it should be that

hard to follow her, if you're careful about it. This does seem like good detective work.

Rockett Rimjob doesn't really want to intervene. She can get all the info she wants later tonight, and

doesn't want to risk losing a client that has a goddamn steam wagon.

Natasha passes through the doors of the town hall and continues through a short antechamber

into the circular meeting room. There are two others there. One looks to be the rep from the Baron's branch of the

railroad and the other appears to be from Black River's side of town.

(To Yuppie b.):

There's a clattering of hooves off in the distance from roughly the same direction

Natasha just came.

Rockett Rimjob looks.

It is a jet black wagon with silver embellishments drawn by two pure white horses. It

seems a little bit less sophisticated than Natasha's ride, more old school. Just as fancy though.

The carriage comes up to town hall and stops.

There is a long pause as the horses spit, neigh, and steam into the open air.

Rockett Rimjob watches.

The door of the carriage slams open and a thin figure dressed in a tasteful black suit,

white shirt, and well oiled black half boots gets out. His hair is supremely styled and his flair is obvious.

"Someone's dressed up in their fancy-pants!"
Said she

"Sorry I am late. Tonight we are here to discuss mutual issues." She says, opting to

stand rather then sit. "This everyone? There should be more."

(From Natasha Minayeva ):

Rickert looks down to Rockett as he descends from his perch.

"Miss Rockett, pleased to make your acquaintance darlin'."
Said Rickert

"Howdy howdy!"
Said Rockett

"Yer reputation precedes you."
Said Rickert

Rickert steps down and takes Rockett's hand. He plants a kiss thereupon.

"Aww..."
Said Rockett

"Why thank you."

"Who do Ah owe tha pleasure?"

"Aw, you probly don' know me."
Said Rickert

"Call me Rickert."

"I'm the one that runs all the show business for Dixie Rails."

"Dixie Rails, huh?"
Said Rockett

what's dixie rails again(From Rockett Rimjob):

"Course."
Said Rickert

One of the rail companies. It's the one run by General Grant's son. The Confederate bigjobs.(To Scotty):

"I'm here to strut my stuff."
Said Rickert

"Be the center of attention."

"Lot like you."

"You got some competition t'night, friendo."
Said Rockett

"That so?"
Said Rickert

"You gonna show me up, or summun else?"

"We waiting on Dixie Rails bigead." Says the one that appears to be the Baron's girl, judging by

the facial markings, ratty top hat, and staff.

(To Yuppie b.):

"Aw heck another one?"
Said Nephi

"Womanizing bastard."
Said The

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"I imagine I'd be laying down and letting you do all the work, sugar."
Said Rickert

"Ah yes...man of hour himself! Tell me, why do we not gun him down right here and

(From Natasha Minayeva ):

"Ah'd say Ah'd see you in hell, then, Nephi, but you an' Ah are goin' different places."
Said Rockett

"Fucking bastard."
Said (From

"Ah sure hope so."
Said Nephi

Rockett Rimjob turns back to Rickert. "That so? Well, Ah'm a little booked t'night -- might go fer tha

highest bidder, though."

"Because if we shoot him down, we don't know where he's squirreled away his assets."
Said (To

"C'mere, Nephi, fer jus' a second."
Said Rockett

"Well, I may not have the most momey, but I'm a good bou."
Said Rickert

"Mississippi grown."

Rockett Rimjob beckons him.

Rickert takes a silver watch out of his pants pocket.

beckons Nephi*Rockett Rimjob:

"Shit, see you after the meetin' hun'."
Said Rickert

"You stay pretty now."

"Can do~"
Said Rockett

"String him up naked as I take him for a ride on my airship. He will talk."
Said (From

"What I like to hear."
Said Rickert

heads overNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Walks into the town hall like he owns the damn place and the business next door too. He twirls the

toothpick between his teeth and he makes his way to the round table and takes a seat. He sprawls into a chair

and kicks one leg up onto the desk. "So, whadda you ladies want of lil' ol' me?"

(To Yuppie b.):

"What?"
Said Nephi

Rockett Rimjob whispers to nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano seems mighty confused... and then flushes completely red and damn near falls

"See you two handsome hunks later~"
Said Rockett

she approaches him with a wide smile. "Johnny rebel." As she approaches she clenches her fists and swings for

his face!

(From Natasha Minayeva ):

"Y-y-you..Nephi "
Said Longiron

"Hoooow fiiiilthy!"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano runs off in the direction Natasha's carriage went off in.

Natasha went into the town hall.

The punch sails towards him and smacks him square in the jaw. He goes to the floor. He gets up

in a second and returns to his position. The only difference is he's holding a handkerchief to his nose now. The

handkerchief turns a gradual red.

(To Yuppie b.):

Do you go into the town hall?

"There...with that out of way. We can have healthy conversation." She says as she

moves back to her seat. "So Rickert...what the fuck?"

(From Natasha Minayeva ):

"Well hell sweetie, I usually pay a lady if she's gonna have me flat on the floor."
Said (To

"Any of you mind explaining to me this ire you've got for me?"
Said (To

Nephi heads to town hall.

"You could not have afforded me either way." She says with an excited grin. "And ire

is simple. It is nothing personal...just want to know how it Is you are hogging business so much."

(From Natasha Minayeva ):

"You've been taking girls. Girls that the rest of us could use."
Said (To

side of the door.

Do you peek in and listen?

Nephi "Longiron" Delano tries to keep from disturbing whatever is going on.

Roll stealth

"I am capitalist myself. We are all capitalist here...but how does dashing Johnny Reb

make such a killing? How are you getting girls?"

(From Natasha Minayeva ):

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Are you fucking them personally?"
Said (From

No TFN luck today, hoorayNephi "Longiron" Delano:

You press your ear to the door and hear the going on inside.Wonderful Cowboy Land:0

"I don't know how you think I can be fuckin' that many girls personally."
Said Rickert

"I'd have to have a god damn long dick to do that."

"Ain't no one got a dick that long."

"Not even Long Dick Johnson."

"I knew him personally."

"But you have lots of experience being dick."
Said Natasha

"He had a fucking long dick."
Said Rickert

"A massive fucking dick."
Said Natasha

Nephi "Longiron" Delano thinks for a minute.

Was Rickert still outside when Nephi left?Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

He went into the town hall.Kakkik:

"Methinks tricky Ricky aten't operatin' on the right side O' the law."
Said Kakkik

"Methinks he mights be doing a little press gangins to get he numbers up."

"Now just for the dumb ones in audience, explain "press ganging" here. And just what that

means. Because if it is so...that is low."

Natasha Minayeva :

Lizzie takes a long drag on her cigarillo.

"Disgusting"
Said Natasha

Rockett Rimjob looks at Nephi and tries to gauge his reaction

"He's kidnapping girls or otherwise forcing them into his dirty little operation."
Said Lizzie

"We don't have any proof, of course."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano had NO idea Rockett was here.

Rockett Rimjob is a few paces away.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano nearly jumps outta his skin when he realizes she's lookin at him.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has to cover his mouth with his hand.

Rockett Rimjob sauters up to the town hall.

"But how else do you explain boom in business?"
Said Natasha

Rockett Rimjob undoes one button on her corset.

"Mile long dick?"
Said Natasha

Rockett Rimjob hikes up her dress a little.

"My natural charm."
Said Rickert

Nephi "Longiron" Delano gestures quietly to the room where the others are

Rockett Rimjob lets her dress slip a little lower past her shoulders.

Rockett Rimjob saunters on up to the door of the town hall, and steps inside.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano draws a line across his mouth, and does the money sign.

You know the one. Rubbing two fingers together.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Rickert looks over to Rockett as she passes through the door.

"Well hell sugarhips."
Said Rickert

Nephi "Longiron" Delano stays out of the immediate line of sight until the door is closed again.

"You are a fucking disgusting piece of trash."
Said Natasha

"How you doin'?"
Said Rickert

Rockett Rimjob looks at Natasha.

"...You got some beef?"
Said Rockett

"We can not prove this bu-"
Said Natasha

Rockett Rimjob looks at Rickert and winks.

Natasha Minayeva looks over

Rockett Rimjob looks back at Natasha.

"I'm bein' accused without a goddamn bit of evidence."
Said Rickert

"Beef? I am not rancher. This man though is pervert. And not good kind of pervert."
Said Natasha

"Thought it was innocent until proven guilty, not the other way around?"
Said Rickert

"...care ta explain?"
Said Rockett

"Ah'd rather like ta know jus' who's plannin' on employin' me."

Rockett Rimjob has an agregious amount of cleavage showing, but isn't nipping quite yet.

"He kidnaps girls and forces them to whore themselves o..."
Said Natasha

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is just glad he's looking at Rockett's back and not her front.

Rockett Rimjob 's back is still quite revealing -- you can see the lowest part of her full moon under her

Rockett Rimjob also has shapely legs and alluring stockings

"Cyka.."
Said Says

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks away for a moment and says a silent prayer for the good lord to give him

"Fuck, maybe you do have charm? Or devil's luck?"
Said Natasha

"Who did you sell soul too?"

"...who, me?"
Said Rockett

"No not you Whore I am talking to your soon to be "
Said EmployerNatasha

"Well that's a little rude."
Said Rockett

'Coulda jus' said so."

"We will find evidence. Don't you worry. And when we do, even whore of babylon will not

save you."

Natasha Minayeva :

"Is this it? Are we done?"

"Or will you confess your sins and save us all the goddamn time?"

"Well. Seems like miss milk-pale's got some gruff with y'all, so Ah'm gonna get outta her damn

hair 'fore she decides ta beat me with a Russian's minin' pick."

Rockett Rimjob:

Rockett Rimjob turns right around.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano quietly makes notes on a little bit of paper he's started keeping with him since

the Whitney incident.

"See ya t'night, Rickert."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob struts right on out.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano watches Rockett strut. Admittedly, even though he knows her to be a raucous,

probably disease-ridden whore... Some dirty thoughts cross his mind.

Rockett Rimjob looks down at Nephi.

"Let's head to tha bar," she says, buttoning back up her corset and making herself a little more

Rockett Rimjob:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is squatting there, slav-like, pencil and paper in hand.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano sighs.

"See ya later girlie."
Said Rickert

"Be thinkin' a you."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano slinks away, quiet as he can, hoping not to be seen by anyone inside.

"And everything you got packed in them clothes."
Said Rickert

Rickert turns to Natasha.

"Be careful! He might put you in chains and force you to- Actually nevermind. She may enjoy

Natasha Minayeva :

"As for your allegations."
Said Rickert

Nephi "Longiron" Delano keeps quiet until he and Rockett are well out of earshot of the riches.

"Fraid I'm gonna have to ask you to eat shit."
Said Rickert

"Cause I ain't confessin' to nothin I ain't done."

Rockett Rimjob looks back, once they're well out of earshot, then turns to Nephi. "You hear that shit?"

"What'd you hear?"
Said Rockett

"Not much incriminating, but a lot of stuff to go on."
Said Nephi

"And I certainly ain't gonna confess to no stuffed shirts that wanna fuck me for my slice of the pie."
Said Rickert

"...Heh. Heck, I might make a mighty fine journalist some day."
Said Nephi

"Sell my stories to the Epitaph..."

"Right. What I got so far."

"Rickert's bein accused of press-gangin by what I'm going to guess is some of the other rail barons."

"So you are not going to man up then. Fine. Good and dandy Reble man."
Said Natasha

"Go kidnap a few more girls then. While you can."

"Enjoy it while it lasts, Cyka."

"There are at least four of them here."
Said Nephi

"Be careful."
Said Rickert

"Righto."
Said Rockett

"Might swing my mile long dick around and knock your pretty lil moneybird outta the sky."
Said Rickert

"And they're definitely inches from straight-up murderin each other."
Said Nephi

"What the heck've we walked into, Rockett?"

"To the surprise'a nobody. How up on current events are ya, miss Rockett?"

"A dilemma."
Said Rockett

"Let's jus' go to tha bar an' relax a bit 'fore tha night's through."

"I would love to see you dip your dick in my thorny bush. If I had one still."
Said Natasha

"Right. Well, you do the relaxin, I'll do the thinkin. Sound good?"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano taps his noggin with his pencil.

"...You tellin' me Ah can't do no thinkin'?"
Said Rockett

"But I don't fuck rapists like that."
Said Natasha

"Whadaya think Ah am? A dumb mindless slut?"
Said Rockett

"No, I'm just sayin yew much prefer the relaxin."
Said Nephi

"Well, how do you fuck rapists?"
Said Rickert

Nephi "Longiron" Delano chuckles.

"Bastard."
Said Rockett

"Whore."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano smiles.

Rickert stands up and walks over to Natasha.

"Why don't you drop by the White dragon and I show you?"
Said Natasha

"Ah ain't into peggin'."
Said Rickert

"But you want to help me puzzle out just what's goin on here, I'm open to help."
Said Nephi

"You do have my cordial invitation to Club 99."
Said Rickert

"Should your starch white shirt and alabaster ass decide to undo your wadded panties."

"I know Dixie Rails is owned by the rebs, just like the Union Pacific is owned by the

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Can't say I'm surprised that Natasha and Rickert want to stab each other with long knives."

"Understood. Speaking of unwadding panties...I am going to fuck off now."
Said Natasha

"Are we done?"

"Meeting adjurned?"

"And they got more money'n you an I will ever own in our lifetimes."
Said Nephi

"Tain't got nothin' else to say."
Said Kakkik

"I think you speak for all of us Miss Natasha."
Said Lizzie

"...We'd be dumb'r than bricks to not take the opportunity to get into at least some of

their good graces."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Two of the ones there, though, I couldn't identify."

"Maybe someone from Iron Dragon or one of the other railroads."

"I would like to tell Rickert to take his mile long prick and make a couple lengths of sausage, but I'm sure

he gets the point."

"Love you too honey."
Said Rickert

"Yes. Lets call it a night then. It was nice seeing you girls...and girl man."
Said Natasha

"Ah getcha."
Said Rockett

"Don't be jealous cause my hair's better'n yours."
Said Rickert

"Phew..."
Said Nephi

"That is a lie and you know it."
Said Natasha

Rickert walks out of town hall with the handkerchief held to his face.

"You just make sure you know what yer doin when you get involved between these

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Sure, and my name's Genghis Fuckin' Khan."
Said Rickert

"Either one of em thinks you're spying for the other, they'll shoot you deader than

Jefferson Davis."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Honey, don't think Ah ain't been down roads like this b'fore."
Said Rockett

Rickert strolls out of town hall and into his carriage.

"...he is handsome." She says as she wipes some of the blood away from her glove while he

walks away. "Shame he makes his business in rape."

Natasha Minayeva :

"There's a reason railroad runners from both sides of tha Mason-Dixon line pine fer me

Rockett Rimjob:

Natasha Minayeva takes some time to clean the blood away

"Ah'm real good at straddlin' tha fence."
Said Rockett

"Ah ain't gonna pry."
Said Nephi

"Ah'm real good at straddlin' a lotta things."
Said Rockett

"...Was that another innuendo?"
Said Nephi

"...Lord give me strength."

Natasha Minayeva eventually gets up and strolls off once everyone else is gone

"You've been prayin' a lot more'n normal lately, Nephi."
Said Rockett

"You sure you's keepin' them innocent eyes from wanderin'?"

"Well, maybe Whitney's been a good influence on me."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano smirks.

"..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob grits her teeth a bit.

"Neat."
Said Rockett

Bartender polishes a mug as he walks over to Nephi and Rockett

Rockett Rimjob seems a little pissed.

Rockett Rimjob turns to the bartender.

"Hey hun."
Said Rockett

Nephi "Longiron" Delano leans back in his seat, and would be chewing bubblegum if any was available.

"Yew got any sasparilla?"
Said Nephi

"Drink?"
Said Bartender

Bartender nods to Nephi.

"Gimme a tall glass."
Said Nephi

"Sasparilla sounds pretty good right now, actually. Make it two."
Said Rockett

"But make hers dirty. I think she'd appreciate it."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano smiles again.

"Not now. Ah ain't yearnin' for any booze just yet."
Said Rockett

"Maybe t'night."

Bartender picks two bottles out from an ice box under the counter and sets them on the bartop.

Bartender lays his hand on each and takes the cap off without a bottle opener. They don't look like twist

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"This keeps up, you'll be able to have some in your very own home.:"

"Mmmm."
Said Bartender

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is too busy being able to have fun at Rockett's expense to notice.

She would send someone to fetch rockett a bit later(From Natasha Minayeva ):

Gotcha.(To Yuppie b.):

Cordially(From Natasha Minayeva ):

Rockett Rimjob shrugs, grabs her bottle, nods at the bartender, and takes a sip.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano does much the same.

"Bet that Natasha character has an icebox in her steam wagon."
Said Nephi

"What'd you thinka them anyways, Rockett?"

"...look like a good lay."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob sips

"You think about anythin' else?"
Said Nephi

Bartender rests his back against the other side of the bar and lets the two converse.

"Like, ever?"
Said Nephi

"No. Ah'm a mindless whore focused on nothin' but sex."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob says flatly.

"Ha-hah."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano takes another sip.

Rockett Rimjob seems a little bitter.

"Real good stuff, thanks Bartender."
Said Nephi

Rockett Rimjob is just a liiiiittle bitter.

"What's gone and crawled into you?"
Said Nephi

"Dunno. Whatever crawled up mah ass died, though."
Said Rockett

"Glad I'm not the John that's gonna have to smell it tonight, then."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano sips more.

"..."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks down into the bottle.

"...Rockett, ah..."
Said Nephi

Rockett Rimjob sips.

"...Ah'm sorry I'm givin ya such a hard time."
Said Nephi

"...S'just how I cope."

"Ain't tha first, won't be tha last. Might as well enjoy yerself while ya do it."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob sips.

"I am, but..."
Said Nephi

"Yew ain't. And I'm sure ya get enough guano dumped on ya' from every pastor from here to perdition itself."

"I know yew got your reasons fer doin what you do."

"Just like Helaman got his. Life'a sin's real easy. Yew don't gotta think if you don't want to."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano sips

"Ah get it. Ya think Ah'm stupid."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob sets her empty bottle on the table.

Rockett Rimjob digs a cigar out of her bag, and grabs a match.

Rockett Rimjob stands up, and as she angrily tries to light it, she starts making her way to the rooms in

the back.

"...Naw."
Said Nephi

"...I think yew made bad choices. Just like we all have."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano finishes his bottle too.

"But we all got the chance to change."
Said Nephi

"It ain't too late for yew, Rockett."

"...You don't gotta live like this. Always another way."

"Food for thought, yeah?"

"Burn in hell."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob says simply, right before closing a door very rudely behind her.

"..."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano hops off his chair and pulls out a dollar and places it on the counter.

"Fer her drink too, yeah?"
Said Nephi

"Keep the change."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano sighs.

"...Guess some folk don't wanna change."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano puts his hands in his pockets and slowly walks away from the bar, back towards

his room, unable to sleep.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano then starts doing what he always does when stressed and unable to sleep,

cleaning his guns.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano keeps doing this until very late at night, when he looks out the door, and sees a

single lit lantern...

Nephi "Longiron" Delano could probably stand being interrupted before then, though.

And you might be surprised to see, of all people, the giant and unmistakable figure of Whitney

walking her way in. You could almost hear her footsteps...

Whitney G. Elieen:

"...Whitney?"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads to the door and opens it.

"...Yer up late."
Said Nephi

"..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen walks forward and nods silently...

"Hey, you alright?"
Said Nephi

"And I have things to tell you, son of Joseph."
Said Whitney

"Where is my sister?"

"...Probably seein to the pleasure of one of the town gentlemen, if I had to guess."
Said Nephi

"Had a real interestin day out with her today, by the way."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is still mostly dressed, though has ditched his duster for just his shirt and

suspendered pants.

Whitney G. Elieen turns her head around and looks at you. Her eyes red with exaustion. Perhaps

something else as well. "She is not hurt is she?"

"Naw."
Said Nephi

"...C'mon in. Sit down, you look like yew need it."

"Will some scripture cheer ya'up? I'll read, if ya'd like."

"..." She nods her head and sits herself down. "I do not know the manner of beast we

fight...but I think I know how we may fight it."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"I will...explain later. I would love to hear you read the scripture. Soon."

strengthens us."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Usually said when she got bit by somethin out in the fields, but still counts."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano gets Whitney one of the blankets from his bed and wraps it around her

Whitney G. Elieen smiles a little at that.

"Always listened to my mama... After all, "I, Nephi, being born of goodly parents..."
Said ...Nephi

"Wise words...reminds me of my mother a little. She used to say such things on our worst of

Whitney G. Elieen:

"First scripture and verse in the Book o'Mormon and my name's in it."
Said Nephi

"Where did i leave it..."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano starts checking around the room.

Whitney G. Elieen reaches into her own pack

Whitney G. Elieen produces her own

"It is not the book of Mormon but...it will do."
Said Whitney

"You shoulda seen yer sister today. She did a good job."
Said Nephi

"Helped get some real good information that'll help us out."

"She was always very talented."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen says softly

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has just produced a holy-hell-that's-so-huge book of scripture why is it so big

Nephi "Longiron" Delano sets it on the table nearest Whitney.

"Son of Joseph. May I confess something to you?"
Said Whitney

"The combination book. Book of mormon, bible, Pearl of Great Price, and the

doctrines of the-"

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"...I may have had a little more to drink than I should have. Before coming here."
Said Whitney

"Yew shouldn't dew that. Yer body's a temple, after all. You wouldn't mess up a temple

to god, would ya?"

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano sits nearby with the big book in his lap.

Whitney G. Elieen nods her head slowly

"Yes I understand..."
Said Whitney

"But go on. What's got ya drinkin more than my brother in his dens o'sin?"
Said Nephi

"..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen opens her mouth as if to say something...only to shut it right after

"...It's yer sister, isn't it?"
Said Nephi

"You're worried about her."

"...She's been outta yer life fer so long, and now she's close again."

"Yew wanna protect her, do the right thing for her, but'cha don't know how."

"..."
Said Whitney

"Bring her back into the light."
Said Nephi

"I don't...I don't want her to hate me..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen begins to sniffle

"...There's a parable, in the Book of Mormon about this."
Said Nephi

"The story of the Prodigal Son."

"Would ya like to hear it?"

"..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen nods

"Ah don;t got it all memorized, so ah'm paraphrasin a bit here."
Said Nephi

his years, but his youngest was wild, with the strength of youth."

"The youngest son, desiring greatly the things of the world, demanded his inheritance from his father."

"His father agreed after much asking, and his son disappeared off into the world, refusing his father's council."

"The son lived among the men of the world, enjoying all the damning pleasures of sin and money. He had many

and the sinful delights he could bring them."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"He could find no work, had no skills to survive."

"Alone. Worthless. Hated."

"...With the last of his strength, he decided he would return to his father's house and cast himself as a slave, for it

would be better than envying pigs for their slop."

"While he was heading home and still a far off, his father had been watching, and waiting."

"The moment he saw a figure approaching his residence, he had hope without hope,

and he ran to the approaching figure. For you see, the entire time, the father had been watching for his foolish son

who he had thought dead."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:00000

"As soon as he recognized his son, he threw himself on him, and embraced him.

"He stank of pig slop, and was caked in mud and rags."

"And he cast himself at his father's feet, and begged to be allowed to become a slave."

"But his father said nay, for this day the Lord had caused his son to come back from the grave."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has started tearing up, just the slightest bit.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano sniffles.

"..."
Said Whitney

"His father said "Come, son, we will slay the fatted calf, and clothe you in fine raiment,

and I will bless you to reenter my house."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"But the Prodigal Son's brother looked on, outraged."

" "He wastes his inheritance and comes home when it's gone, to a feast?" "

"His father chastised him for this. He said. "You have been good and faithful to me for all these years and do not

think I have forgotten. But this day your brother has returned from the dead."

"Long have I waited, and now my family is whole once more."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks down, then back up at Whitney.

"Ah mighta missed some parts, but that's the gist of it."
Said Nephi

"You try to push her, to pull her back, she'll push back just as hard."

"She'll fight yew because she can. Because it's easy. Because she'll think it's right."

"The wages of sin are sadness."

"It's gonna end one day. She's gonna get old, or fat, or crank out more kids'n my mama."

"And if yer there for her, she'll come back t'yew."
Said Nephi

"And you'll rejoice."

"...she is like this because of me. Because I pushed her away...she came to me for help and

guidance and instead I..."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"I was...I was just trying to help..."

"I know how ya feel."
Said Nephi

Whitney G. Elieen tears up anew, wiping fresh tears away from her eyes.

"I didn't want to...I didn't..."
Said Whitney

Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads over, and places a single hand on Whitney's shoulder.

"The road t'hell's paved with good intentions, Whitney..."
Said Nephi

"But so's the road t'heaven."

"Yer a good girl. Yer tryin to do the right thing."

"That's step one, y'know?"

"Trust in'th lord. He'll help you find the rest o'the way."

"..."
Said She

Nephi "Longiron" Delano reaches in, and gives Whitney a hug. A very platonic hug.

Whitney G. Elieen wraps her arms around him and squeezes tight

...maybe a bit too tight. Oh dear. You didn't think this through, did you?Whitney G. Elieen:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano gags quietly

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is a scrawny, reedy little thing and easily crushed

Nephi "Longiron" Delano breathes out a squeak

Whitney G. Elieen releases him after a time...

"liiiittle too tight-"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano gasps for air when she releases him.

"...Whew, alright, little bit much there, but ah feel ya."
Said Nephi

"...I can not be here. T.thank you for comforting me..."
Said Whitney

"Don't be the Prodigal Son's brother, yeah?"
Said Nephi

"And it's no problem. Anytime."

"...yes...you are...you are more than welcomed..."
Said Whitney

"Yew show me yers and I'll show yew mine."
Said Nephi

"...God Bless you Nephi."
Said Whitney

Nephi "Longiron" Delano smiles in the friendliest way he can manage.

Whitney G. Elieen gets up onto her feet

"You too, Whitney. Lord knows we're both gonna need it."
Said Nephi

"...Better get outta here before it starts up again."

"...Rockett's in the room next door."

"...tell my sister there is a way to fight the demon...if she will hear it..."
Said Whitney

"Ah will."
Said Nephi

Whitney G. Elieen freezes up for a second

"In fact, ah did."
Said Nephi

"She told me to go ta'hell."

"...I mean physically...I can...I can bless the bullets..."
Said Whitney

"Yew ever need-"
Said Nephi

"You mean THAT demon."

"..."
Said Whitney

Nephi "Longiron" Delano giggles.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano giggles a bit harder

"..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen looks to the other room and then looks to Nephi. "I can't...I must go. I must...return to

my prayers."

"God bless you this evening...thank you."
Said Whitney

"...?"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano grows a confused look on his face

Whitney G. Elieen supresses yet more tears as she makes her way to the door

"We shall...talk more yes?"
Said Whitney

"Yeah. You gonna be alright?":Nephi "
Said Longiron

"...If God wills it to be..."
Said Whitney

"Goodnight Son of Joseph."

"He always looks out for us, Whitney. Even if you think he's not there."
Said Nephi

"He'll never abandon ya."

"Go on. Get some rest."

Whitney G. Elieen smiles a bit before making her way out. Step after heavy step.

"...She's a sweet girl."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano closes the door behind her.

"...Real... Real sweet."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has started sweatin a bit, and takes a single, lingering look in her direction

before heading back to cleaning his guns.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano just waits to hear Rockett getting back to it again...

Nephi "Longiron" Delano waits, annoyed.

Seems she isn't busy.Rockett Rimjob:

Were you hopin' to get off to the sounds of her work?

No.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

But it does provide a nice work rhythm.

And characters

"...and that's when the fool tried to spin his gun."
Said Bartender

"Ended up ruining my wall and blowin' out his kneecap."

"...Impressive."
Said Rockett

Bartender takes Rockett's mug, walks over a few paces, and starts filling it again.

"I kno-"
Said Bartender

At that moment, a burly man with a step like a muted thunderclap walks into the

saloon. He has a frosty glass tucked under one arm and a set of roses in the other.

Oh God.Rockett Rimjob:

Dobray walks over to Rockett with the inevitability of an oncoming glacier. There is a slight hitch in his

step when he picks up his left leg.

"Howdy partner."
Said Rockett

Dobray bows before Rockett.

Rockett Rimjob offers him a smile.

Rockett Rimjob raises her brows in an equal mount of surprise and befuddled confusion.

"Em here to peek oop for Miz Natasha."
Said Dobray

"Ei bring floowers."

"Und es cream."

Dobray holds up the roses and what appears to be a glass jar full of homemade ice cream.

"Ees peach."
Said Dobray

Rockett Rimjob looks at the bartender with a -look.-

Bartender holds his hands up and looks away, absolving himself of any association.

Rockett Rimjob looks back at the burly Russian man.

"...well. Ah thought Ah informed miss Natasha about tha unfortunate... schedulin', of t'night's

affair. She'd have me booked fer too long, hun -- Ah might not'a been able ta get more... urgent, obligations taken

care of."

Rockett Rimjob:

"Ah believe we set up a date fer a few months down tha line in Winnipeg?"

"Much as Ah hate ta turn down such a wonderful gift..."

Rockett Rimjob looks genuinely saddened.

"Ah, vell, you tek rooses und es crem anyveh."
Said Bartender

"Bid ahd-"

"Miiiiiiiss Rockett."
Said Rickert

"Ah'm heah to..."

Rickert looks at the massive Russian man.

Dobray narrows his eyes at Rickert.

"...don't you worry 'bout him none, he was jus' leavin'," she says, reaching up to give him a peck

on the cheek.

Rockett Rimjob:

"You..."
Said Dobray

"She knows."
Said (From

"I hef, instruktions foor you."
Said Dobray

Dobray walks forward towards Rickert and cracks his knuckles.

"I'm sure we can talk this out."
Said Rickert

Rickert walks forward a step, takes a good look at the Russian's eyes, and decides against it.

"Jody?"
Said Rickert

"Don't worry boss."
Said Jody

"I remember you."
Said Dobray

"Poot heetch in mine leg."

"I'll do the other leg for you."
Said Jody

"Gentlemen, please."
Said Rockett

"Simmer down a touch? Yer in tha presence of a lady."

"Best to let them go at it."
Said Rickert

"I won't hear the end of it from Jody otherwise."

"Hasn't had a good fight in weeks."

"...Guess Ah'll enjoy tha show, then."
Said Rockett

Rickert sidles up to Rockett and puts his arm around her.

"Or d'you got some... ants in yer pants?"
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob glances down.

"...looks like a lot more'n a few ants, now that Ah look..."
Said Rockett

"I do try sweetie."
Said Rickert

Wow.Rockett Rimjob:00

Jody Centen:

Jody Centen pulls out a Bowie knife half as long as his arm and rushes the Russian.

Jody Centen:+02+01

Dobray takes the knife to his guts. It doesn't seem to do a whole lot.

"Ees joke, yes?"
Said Dobray

"Ei geef, poonchline."

Dobray pulls out a truncheon about the size of his arm, grabs Jody by the scruff of his shirt, and attempts

to nail the other man into the ground.

Jody Centen takes a few good hits from the Russian before managing to get loose. He cracks his neck

and a few spots of red appear on his shirt.

Jody Centen:

Jody Centen pulls out a chrome revolver and unloads two shots into the big man.

Jody Centen:+0405

Dobray watches as the first bullet manages to do fuck and all to his defense of coat and rock hard

Russian muscle. The second one sinks home, but does about as much as the knife.

"Been working out."
Said Jody

"Yes."
Said Dobray

Dobray informs Jody that it is clobbering time.

Jody Centen takes another hit to the mouth. A tooth sails out and skitters around on the wood floor of the

Jody Centen:

Jody Centen fires two more bullets into the Russian, hoping that they do better than the last ones.

Jody Centen:+0406

Dobray takes a fair amount of damage. He has a few holes in his nice yellow coat now, but remains

otherwise unperturbed.

Dobray puts away his truncheon and retrieves something about the same length.

"My toorn."
Said Dobray

Dobray backs up a step.

Jody Centen stumbles as the top side of his chest takes a shotgun blast. It looks like someone threw a

pile of bloody ground beef at him.

Rockett Rimjob looks over her shoulder to see what the bartender thinks of this.

"Aright."
Said Rickert

Bartender watches the display with distaste, though that's probably because he has to clean up after this.

Dobray tucks his shotgun back into his coat.

Dobray walks over to Rickert and pulls a wad of cash out of his left pocket.

"For meedecal beels."
Said Dobray

Dobray walks over to Jody.

"I think we even now."
Said Dobray

Dobray walks out of the door. He casts a glance over his shoulder to Rockett.

"Dasvedanya for now. You are nize lady Miz Rockett."
Said Dobray

"Toodles, sweetie~"
Said Rockett

"Wouldn't mind havin' a taste of that Russian cuisine..."0000000

Jody Centen gets up after a few moments of bleeding onto the floor.

"Y'alright, stud?"
Said Rockett

"Fine."
Said Jody

"Looks a mite nasty.Rockett Rimjob:

"Taken worse before."
Said Jody

"So's he."

"Thought he wouldn't be walking after the last time."

"You two ever wanna settle yer differences over a woman some time you jus' come an' talk ta

Rockett Rimjob:

"Ah'm afraid ya might shoot eachother over who gets tha back end, though."

Jody Centen slips his knife and pistol back into their holsters and walks to the door. He opens it with his

left hand.

"Might."
Said Jody

"Good show, for the both of you."
Said Rickert

"Let's~"
Said Rockett

Rickert sticks a toothpick into his mouth as he strolls out the door with his arm still around Rockett.

"Now lemme see what'cha got, handsome..."
Said Rockett

"Lil girl you are hornier'n a toad frog."
Said Rickert

"I like that."

The three of you head out towards the local graveyard. It is a ways out of town, and

the sun is almost down below the horizon when you arrive. There is a man out amongst the graves. He is bent

over next to a grave whose tombstone is broken in half.

Poage reaches into Yuppie's pocket, searching for snacks

Everything recorded?

Errything recorded.Alexander Hauswald:

Yuppie b. slaps away!

Yuppie b. replaces with an actual snack

Poage munches on the snack

"...sorry, sorry, won't happen a..."
Said Hamilton

"'Scuse me."
Said Alexander

"Hello!"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire waves

Whitney G. Elieen bows

Hamilton Hendricks turns his head to look at the folks that just walked up to the graveyard. He pushes

himself up from his crouch next to the grave a moment later.

Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit holds a peppermint stick in his mouth like a cigar.

"What are..."
Said Hamilton

"What are you folks doin' out here?"

"Mr. Hendricks, I assume."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald takes a step closer, offering his hand for shaking.

Hamilton Hendricks wipes gravedirt off his hand and places it in Alex's.

Sacks just sits down, trying to get Lil's peppermint stick.

"...We are looking for you, I believe."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire stays back.

Alexander Hauswald shakes it, his face stoic.

cemetery though.

(To UrbanCritter):

Crystal Saint Claire gently discouraces Sacks from aquiring Peppermint Stick

"Someone said you might help us."
Said Alexander

Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit ain't sharing his delicious peppermint stick.

Alexander Hauswald looks around, uneasy.

"Help you with...what 'sactly?"
Said Hamilton

"I'm...just the gravetender."

"Most people don't pay me no nevermind."

"Someone said you know... things."
Said Alexander

"Things we might have use of."

Hamilton Hendricks backs a few paces away from Alex.

"What...things?"
Said Hamilton

"...Let's call them stranger things."
Said Alexander

Hamilton Hendricks works his jaw for a few moments. No words come out. He backs up until he's

standing on the dirt of the grave behind him.

"No."
Said Hamilton

"That may not have been a good place to start..."
Said Crystal

"I don't..."
Said Hamilton

Alexander Hauswald looks confused. You think.

"I don't have that..."
Said Hamilton

"I don't..."

"I never meant..."

"..."
Said Alexander

"..."
Said Crystal

Alexander Hauswald turns to look at Crystal and Whitney.

Crystal Saint Claire holds Bawss a little closer

"Stay near me."
Said Crystal

"I am concerned."

Hamilton Hendricks one hand pulls at his shirt as he speaks. The other keeps trying to wipe dirt off on his

"..."
Said Whitney

"Settle down."
Said Alexander

"You're not in trouble."

"You need not be concerned Mr.Hendricks. My friend speaks true."
Said Whitney

"We're in a problem and we think you might help us."
Said Alexander

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire walks up, lookin' all childlike.

"No...I..."
Said Hamilton

Crystal Saint Claire looks at the broken tombstone

Cedric 1840-1869

"Listen."
Said Alexander

"Let's sit down somewhere and have a civilized talk."

"They don't let me go no more."
Said Hamilton

"They?"
Said Whitney

"Who are they?"

"Who don't?"
Said Alexander

"Who was Cedric?"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire doesn't look up from the tombstone

Hamilton Hendricks keeps grabbing at his shirt and trying to wipe dirt off on his pants leg. Until Crystal

says the name. He stops moving and looks at Alex. Hamilton's eyes are bloodshot.

"...Get behind me, kid."
Said Alexander

Sacks perks up.

Hamilton Hendricks runs forward and grabs Alex's shirt.

"Wha-!"
Said Alexander

"What are you-- ah!"
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen steps forward

"Pleasepleasepleasepleasehelphelphelp"
Said Hamilton

Sacks barks and starts running!

"...We'll help. Just calm down."
Said Alexander

Crystal Saint Claire gets knocked slightly forwards, tumbling onto the broken gravestone.

"Ow..."
Said Crystal

"Are you alright Crystal...?"
Said Whitney

Some of the dirt on the graves begins to shift.

"..."
Said Whitney

"... Oh, hell no."
Said Alexander

"Ididn'tknowdidn'tknow."
Said Hamilton

"Alexander...give me some of your bullets please."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen says as the dirt begins to shift

Alexander Hauswald fishes a few rounds and wordlessly hands them to Whitney.

Crystal Saint Claire stands up. "Whitney, I gave you a few little red shotshells earlier... Do you still have

The dirt on the graves burst outward in a shower of earth and rotten carcasses crawl

How many does he give WhitneyWhitney G. Elieen:

"...Walkin' Dead."
Said Alexander

Let's say a dozen rounds.

"We should not panic. The important thing is that we do not panic, do not panic."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire is panicking.

"The first thing to do is FIND SOME DAMN COVER."
Said Alexander

"From what? They won't have useable firearms... w-will they?"
Said Crystal

So sorry. need to bring up the necessary docs...Whitney G. Elieen:

Hamilton Hendricks slumps to the ground as the zombies rise from their graves. He grabs onto the

tombstone and huddles up next to it.

Whitney G. Elieen gives bullets back after spending 3 red chips to consencrate 3 bullets against the

undead. Or such is the plan in either case.

Alexander Hauswald somehow loads all three of them, along with three more, in two seconds.

Going to make the necessary faith rolls to determine which one works. If such is to the

pleasure of the GM.

Whitney G. Elieen:

The closest cadaver paws at his holster and pulls from it a rusty Colt. He aims the firearm

at Alexander and pulls the trigger.

Undead Leadslinger:

"Who th'bloody 'ell buries someone with a LOADED GUN!?"
Said Crystal

Undead Leadslinger:01

Crystal Saint Claire is SISTRESSED

((Am I dead?))Alexander Hauswald:

The bullet goes wide.Undead Leadslinger:

Alexander Hauswald smirks, his gun glowing with an unnatural aura.

Sacks growls at the living dead.

The one in front of Alex pulls a similiar firearm from his ragged holster with a desiccated

Undead Leadslinger:

He manages the hit the tombstone that Hendricks is clutching.

"...Hendricks, you okay?"
Said Alexander

Undead Leadslinger shuffles forth and latches onto Alex with unnatural strength.

Hamilton Hendricks whispers terse bits of gibberish to himself as he cradles the tombstone. He doesn't

seem to have all his marbles.

"AAAAAAAH-!"
Said Alexander

Hamilton Hendricks:+0504

Hot damn.

((... Am I dead))Alexander Hauswald:

You got 2 wounds to your...armUndead Leadslinger:

He takes a big hunk out of your shooting arm.

Using any chips to negate it?

Two whites, one red, or one blue.Undead Leadslinger:

Two whites it is.Alexander Hauswald:

Undead Leadslinger:

The undead's head is now missing most everything above the jaw. Bits of skull scatter over the graveyard like

grisly snowflakes.

"Aim for the head."

Alexander Hauswald turns around and shoots at the one behind him.

Alexander Hauswald lines up a shot, and... BANG.

To the head?Undead Leadslinger:

Yep.Alexander Hauswald:

Said Sacks

"I don't like these things..."

Thankfully, none of them hit Crystal.

Said Alexander

You got another action.

Crystal Saint Claire scrambles straight back until she bumps into something.

Hamilton Hendricks shifts at little bit and lets out a low whine as Crystal backs up into him.

(That count as action? If not, I'll reload.)Crystal Saint Claire:

Go ahead and reload.Hamilton Hendricks:

Crystal Saint Claire reloads.

Undead Leadslinger fires his rusty Colt at Crystal as she hunkers down next to Hendricks.

Undead Leadslinger:+01

What're we looking atCrystal Saint Claire:

The bullet thwacks into Crystal's chest. It doesn't appear to have hit anything vital, but

she's still bleeding.

Undead Leadslinger:

One wound.

How much to negate?Crystal Saint Claire:

Alexander Hauswald would probably react if he wasn't busy with getting mauled by mr. zombie man here

Undead Leadslinger shuffles towards the party and leans on a tombstone to fire at Alexander.

One white chip Crystal.Undead Leadslinger:

Spending itCrystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire applies pressure to the wound. Fortunately, it just kinda grazed her, but she likes this

The bullet hits Alex in the arm and lodges there. One wound.Undead Leadslinger:

"ARGH-!"
Said Alexander

Shooting arm or other one?

Other one.Undead Leadslinger:

Alright.Alexander Hauswald:

(Picturing the Ace Ventura scene with the spears)Crystal Saint Claire:

Undead Leadslinger shuffles towards Crystal, trips over the fallen tombstone, and attempts to gnaw her

legs off.

Undead Leadslinger:+03+05

I am worriedCrystal Saint Claire:000000

It would probably be more effective if he had all his teeth, but he uses the few remaining

him to do some good nibblin'.

Undead Leadslinger:

One wound.

Crystal Saint Claire kicks at the undead

why do i not have a spell that makes zombie heads explodeAlexander Hauswald:

that sounds like a useful spell to have

You do.Undead Leadslinger:

It's called.

As it says in the good book

Ok. I'll take this one thenCrystal Saint Claire:

Whitney will pray the pain awayAlexander Hauswald:

Crystal Saint Claire screams as a jagged, rotted tooth sinks into her ankle

Remember that and take it into account Crystal.Undead Leadslinger:

So technically I got no woundsAlexander Hauswald:

Undead Leadslinger throws himself forward with a broken footed gait to ravage Whitney.

Yes.Undead Leadslinger:

Whitney G. Elieen continues to sing, even as a look of horror dawns on her upon seeing the freshly

inflicted wound upon Crystal...

Undead Leadslinger:+03+06

First one is ignored.Undead Leadslinger:

Second bit does one wound of damage as the zombie slashes at Crystal's leg with his yellowed nails.

Same leg, or..?Crystal Saint Claire:

Oh.Undead Leadslinger:

Whitney's leg.

Also in that case.

It does no damage.

Due to Whitney's song and Whitney being HUGE.

YUGECrystal Saint Claire:

Whitney G. Elieen keeps on singing as the zombie swipes at her leg and does NOTHING

One time whitney got shot with a shotgunAlexander Hauswald:

she sneezed

Whitney G. Elieen looks down at said zombie, towering high above the wretched creature

(I gotta BRB after this round)Crystal Saint Claire:

Cedric steps back from Alex with a bloody mouth and holds up a Colt. He puts one hand on the hammer

and fans a few bullets into the former lawman.

Should be good.Crystal Saint Claire:

Only one of the first volley hits, the other two go wide.

Cedric drops the spent pistol and lunges for Whitney's throat.

(...So one wound...?)Alexander Hauswald:

You would have some wounds, but Whitney's singing is making it a bit difficult to hurt you.Cedric:

You don't know about all that Jesus stuff.

You're all for it.

(To GM) rolling 2d6!!

Cedric manages to get most of the way to biting at Whitney's neck, but Whitney is so damn tall that he

doesn't make it all the way up. He's still ugly as sin and smells like sewage though.

Crystal Saint Claire FUCKING SHOOTS THE ZOMBIE WITH A TOOTH IN HER FOOT

Should be close enough I can literally kiss them with the barrel, right?Crystal Saint Claire:

Oh yeah.Cedric:

Well then, straight to damage?Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire:

The head of the malevolent thing lights up for a moment as Crystal's special buckshot

blows through it. Then it detonates like a Jack O Lantern filled with dynamite.

Undead Leadslinger:00000000000

Several teeth hit Alex. They feel hot as spent shell casings.

I'll assume Crystal reloads for her next action.

Alex man.

Right.Alexander Hauswald:

I got two bullets left, right?

I assume so.Undead Leadslinger:

One of them gets unloaded in Cedric's face.Alexander Hauswald:

How many can a blue chip get me?

There you go.

Remove your blue chip.

The last bullet, miraculously, does not follow the others into missing.Undead Leadslinger:

The bullet hits him in his cheek. A well of blood starts up from it, but he doesn't seem to be too bothered by it.

"...Whitney. Kill that thing."
Said Alexander

"Kill it dead."

Whirtney.Undead Leadslinger:

K so I think I am going to spend a blue chip, and with this chip...Whitney G. Elieen:

You do hit it.Undead Leadslinger:

Let me see.

Cedric takes a good hit to the head from Whitney. It deforms the shape of his skull. Then he wraps his

jaws around the pipe and puts four neat little holes in it with his teeth before letting it go. You seem to

have made it angry Whitney.

But I can actually shoot it with Pistol with an entirely offset penalty.(From Crystal Saint Claire):

(To GM) rolling 2d6!!

The shot tears through the thing's bald skull and exposes a red streaked mass of cracked cranium. It

does not appear to be too inconvenienced.

Alexander Hauswald pauses.

Alexander Hauswald proceeds to aim for the heart.

Alexander Hauswald lines up a shot, and... BANG.

Alexander Hauswald:+011+08+0905

I'm picturing Cedric just holding Crystal during all this like a bottle of gatorade(From Crystal Saint Claire):

Slow down there son.Cedric:

(To GM) rolling 2d6!!

I think that's accurate enough to operate for brain cancer.Alexander Hauswald:

With a chainsaw.

The final shot sails through the air and enters the thing's forehead with uncommon grace. It digs through

flower of red.

Cedric lurches forward for a few moments, and falls to the dusty ground in front of Alex. With no living

flesh to actuate it, this nightmare mad material is nothing more than a pile of odorous offal.

"..."
Said Alexander

"Rest in peace."

Crystal Saint Claire is still freaking out.

Undead Leadslinger jerks, and falls to the ground in a lifeless heap. The rest of the zombies still standing

do the same.

"Did we get 'em?"
Said Lil

Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit walks forward and pokes a re-dead dead body with his gun.

"I think we did."
Said Alexander

Whitney G. Elieen releases her song and falls to the ground

Whitney G. Elieen gasps!

But first.Lil' Big Junior Bawss Bandit:

Crystal Saint Claire has, by now, at least stopped screaming, and downgraded to curling up in a ball on

the ground sobbing.

Whitney G. Elieen slowly gets herself back up onto her feet. "...Thank you Lord, for blessing me with

capable friends."00000

Alexander Hauswald holsters his gun. And examines Cedric's.

Whitney G. Elieen steps across the bloodied mess of bone and muscle

Whitney G. Elieen leans herself down and grabs Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen pulls her into a hug...

Hamilton Hendricks looks up from the tombstone with eyes puffy and red from crying.

Crystal Saint Claire starts screaming and kicking the moment Whitney touches her.

The gun is a rusty colt Navy Alex.

"Shhhh-"
Said Whitney

"No! Let meGO! nooOOOOOOO!"
Said Crystal

"It's okay..."
Said Whitney

"...over...is...it...over?"
Said Hamilton

"It's over now..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen nods her head

(be back in a tick)Hamilton Hendricks:

"It's over."
Said Alexander

"It is done..."
Said Whitney

Alexander Hauswald turns to Hamilton, breathing deeply.

"What did you do?"
Said Alexander

Crystal Saint Claire seems to realize it's Whitney holding her, and just... crumples like wet paper into a

silently sobbing heap.

Hamilton Hendricks rolls onto his side and produces a noise halfway between sobbing and laughter.

"There there..."
Said Whitney

"Nothing more will hurt you...

(back)Hamilton Hendricks:

Crystal Saint Claire clings to Whitney, ignoring everything else until her heartbeat slows back down.

"He's...dead."
Said Hamilton

"Sure is."
Said Alexander

"Why'd he get up?"

Hamilton Hendricks pushes himself to a sitting position with his arms and leans his back against the

"I...I...raised him."
Said Hamilton

"..."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald folds his hands.

"I needed...help."
Said Hamilton

"Help with what?"
Said Alexander

"Rita Mayfield...my girl...she was took."
Said Hamilton

"I knew...who done it."

Hamilton Hendricks rests his head in his hands.

"I knew...couldn't get her back by maself."
Said Hamilton

"..."
Said Alexander

"We're marshalls."

"The new marshals. We'll help."

"I'm gonna...hang ain't I?"
Said Hamilton

Crystal Saint Claire is still pretty much buried in Whitney.

"I reckon I can arrange a pardon if you help us."
Said Alexander

"Maybe let you live with what you did will be enough."

"O...kay, okay sir."
Said Hamilton

"I'll...do that."

"Right.Alexander Hauswald:

"Since you know a thing or two about walking dead."

"What do you know about the Revenant?"

"Reven...ant?"
Said Hamilton

"Don't...rightly know...sir."

"Ghost man. Goes around, kills lawmen. Only lawmen."
Said Alexander

"But...I...got a...friend."
Said Hamilton

"A friend?"
Said Alexander

("He's at the bar.")Crystal Saint Claire:

("I don't see him."

"He's on the other side.")

("He's a spirit?"

"I...can...call him."
Said Hamilton

"...that would be much appreciated Mr.Hendricks."
Said Whitney

"Call him, then."
Said Alexander

"Did he tell you how to do that?"

Alexander Hauswald motions to the goblin

"Yeah..."
Said Hamilton

Hamilton Hendricks pulls a pen knife from his pants pocket. He flicks it out. He puts one hand around the

blade and draws the pen knife out. Red flows from the cut. He smears it on the ground in the shape of an

unbounded star.

Sacks whimpers.

"Wh-whitney? P-please... would you mind getting my gun? I dropped it..."
Said Crystal

"...of course."
Said Whitney

Hamilton Hendricks slumps back onto the tombstone. His jaw is slack.

Whitney G. Elieen says as she moves to fetch said weapon

Sacks grips his gun in his holster

"..."
Said Whitney

"...Oh."
Said Sacks

"It's you."

"...someone you know?"
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen grabs Crystal

"I had a game of cards with him.Alexander Hauswald:

"..."
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen places Crystal behind her.

"I told him, you know."???:

Crystal Saint Claire is holding on to Whitney's leg tightly.

"What the price would be for calling me again."???:

Whitney G. Elieen stands up to her full height and spreads her arms out

Whitney G. Elieen stares at the demon in front of her

"..."
Said Alexander

"Give him a discount. He did it for a good reason."

"I'm afraid he has already paid."???:

"...Not the time for another game for someone's soul, huh?"
Said Alexander

"That's pleasure."???:

"You want something."

"Something that I have."

"The Revenant. How do we kill him?"
Said Alexander

"I know."???:

Crystal Saint Claire picks up her gun.

Crystal Saint Claire is reloading it.

Alexander Hauswald reaches into his pockets...

She's reloading the Ghost in the Shell(From Crystal Saint Claire):

"I know as well"
Said Whitney

Alexander Hauswald pulls out one of the unidentified coins.

"Will this be enough?"
Said Alexander

Crystal Saint Claire stares at ???'s feet.

"That's a trifle."???:

"Fun to collect, but worthless, in the end."

"I want something real."

"Pay not the demon. The divine benefit I have is more than enought to slay the revenant."
Said Whitney

"Name your price."
Said Alexander

"What more can you offer that the Lord has not already provided to me?"
Said Whitney

"Whitney, if that was it someone would do it already."
Said Alexander

Whitney G. Elieen shakes her head

"It is not something anyone can do."
Said Whitney

"Why do you think I asked you for bullets?"

"I want you to make me an offer."???:

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire steps over towards Hendricks.

"He paid in memories."???:

"I can pay in favours."
Said Alexander

"You help us, I'll help you one day."

"I know the name of the creature and so does God. You will be paying this demon for a boon

we already have"

Whitney G. Elieen:

"...Whitney."
Said Alexander

"If you knew all along."

Crystal Saint Claire pokes at Hendricks.

"Why'd we come here?"
Said Alexander

"Is he dead?"
Said Crystal

"His brain is."???:

"...forever?"
Said Crystal

"I thought we could learn more of this demon. The ability to kill is with me already. But further

knowledge of what we face can help with the work."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"I accept."???:

"...Do you take all the memories?"
Said Crystal

"That is why I came h-"
Said Whitney

Alexander Hauswald looks at Whitney.

Whitney G. Elieen grits her teeth

Alexander Hauswald looks at the demon.

"Let's rephrase the contract a bit."
Said Alexander

"Or... can you pick, and choose?"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire takes some paper from her bag.

"A favor's very valuable."
Said Alexander

"I took the best ones first."???:

Crystal Saint Claire offers Hauswald a paper, and pencil, and a little board to write against.

"Those that he would give."???:

"Then I took the rest."

"As he kept asking for favors."

"Until there was nothing left."

"Are you able... to look? Just look?"
Said Crystal

"Look at, what?"???:

"Memories."
Said Crystal

"Right. We need to know."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald takes a deep breath.

"I know what you want already."

"..."
Said Crystal

"What are we fighting? How do we kill it? How do we make sure it'll stay dead?"
Said Alexander

"..."
Said Whitney

Crystal Saint Claire starts writing.

"The favor can be valuable."???:

"That's first."
Said Alexander

She's basically writing a contract.(From Crystal Saint Claire):

"Second, the favor."
Said Alexander

"If and when you come cashing it in."

"...may I intercede?"
Said Crystal

"I don't want any-"
Said Alexander

"Feel free."
Said Alexander

"Let me finish with Mister Hauswald first."???:

Crystal Saint Claire continues writing.

"But this pertains to his contract, sir."
Said Crystal

"Does it?"???:

"Crystal..."
Said Whitney

time of the favor's calling, would take precedence over any obligations brought upon him by the favor."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"To put it simply, it's just a clause that would prevent you from having him shoot us in the

Crystal Saint Claire:

"We can change some of the wording, if you'd like..."

"The favor will be carte blanche."???:

"That too. When I take the bargain, I don't want to end up suffering for it."
Said Alexander

"If you want what you're asking for."???:

"That is... a rather steep price for three questions, is it not?"
Said Crystal

"I don't want to end up with something like, say, going on a shootout and finding out I shot

Alexander Hauswald:

"If you want something without suffering for it, I'm afraid you're talking to the wrong person."???:

Crystal Saint Claire sighs.

"I want a fair price."
Said Alexander

"You have my price."???:

"Which is as fair as it comes."

Crystal Saint Claire continues writing.

(Be back in a bit)???:

Crystal Saint Claire:

"When you come cashing in, I won't betray my friends or their friends. That's my only

Alexander Hauswald:

"Alexander..." She says, turning her head to the huckster. Her expression one of

overwhelming concern.

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Whitney."
Said Alexander

"Please...think this through..."
Said Whitney

"This demon can bring you only suffering in the end..."

"Already had my suffering."
Said Alexander

For later, the three quesries are a request for information regarding the revenant

KEEP it down afterwards.

(From Crystal Saint Claire):

"If others don't as a result, I don't mind."
Said Alexander

"...Are you certain of this?"
Said Whitney

"I have... a draft here. Factoring in Mr. Hauswald's stipulation, this demon's desires, and a

precise quantification of the trade. There are still SOME ways this could be abused, but I've tried to take away

some of the more egregious offenses."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"For example, if the favor was signing into some larger, more elaborate deal designed to further ensnare you, that

would go against this draft."

"The favor would be non-transferrable."

"He can't make me sign a deal like that."
Said Alexander

"It's not how it works."

"..."
Said Crystal

"...i do not understand most of this, but I understand contractual law..."

"...It follows a more...infernal set of rules Crystal."
Said Whitney

"It is more akin to a shady casino then a true court of law."

"He can't back out on his deals. But he can and will twist the words as much as he can."
Said Alexander

"...then agreeing to a carte blanch means he can ask you to do literally anything of which

you are capable."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Correct."
Said Alexander

"And you are completely capable of entering a contract, as we have just seen, no?"
Said Crystal

"It could be considered as forcing you into a contract, but this is not a court of law."

"You got a point."
Said Alexander

"Name your favor, demon."

"...He has said he wishes it to remain somewhat nebulous... I believe there should just be a

few stipulations preventing obvious infractions."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Such as?"
Said Alexander

"Not bringing you into new contracts with it, or pressuring you into a situation in which the

only solution is to make a contract..."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"...Not... um..."

"...I do not know the rules they play by, so it is difficult to create a contract adhering to them..."

(C'mon. Let's finish this soon.)Alexander Hauswald:

(I'm sorry...)Crystal Saint Claire:

pocket of his suit.

"Here's my terms, demon."
Said Alexander

"I won't betray my friends and I won't agree to new deals with the favor."

"That is covered..."
Said Crystal

"Show me the scroll."
Said Alexander

"I'm afraid I can't, until our deal is finalized."???:

"You're not the first to try and burn me."

"Do I have your word it's what we agreed on?"
Said Alexander

"Then fine."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald shakes the demon's hand with his left hand.

"We have a deal, demon."
Said Alexander

"We do."???:

Alexander Hauswald reads it.

"To kill a thing that is not, one must first the crux of its existence plot. Delve into the heart of the matter to

cause the Revenant a splatter."

"...So we shoot it in the heart to kill it."
Said Alexander

"You've got your information, and I have a favor."???:

"Name it."
Said Alexander

"I will."???:

"When I collect."

"You might could use this."???:

Alexander Hauswald grabs it.

"What's this?"
Said Alexander

"Find out."???:

"See you later."???:

"Goodbye."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald examines his object.

"See you soon."???:

It appears to be a small journal.

Most of the pages are boring, all about Hendricks and his beau to be.

Alexander Hauswald will examine it when he gets back.

The latter pages have some more interesting information.

The most familiar of which is the symbol written in blood at Hendrick's feet.

An unbounded star.

It appears many times.

Interesting.Alexander Hauswald:

I assume that with that they head home?

Unless you want to do anything else here.

Nnnnope.Alexander Hauswald:

Except maybe make poor Hendrick comfortable.

He'll be fine.

He's already in a graveyard.

Alright.Alexander Hauswald:

Then we're done.

I just got my ass home

Rickert and Rockett head over to his pad while doing some hanky panky on the way. His place in

town is a hotel that he's got decked out in hilariously opulent fashion. Rickert and Rockett do the diddly and he

gives her an open invitation to come to club 99.

(To Scotty):

No. There were other things I wanted to do.(From Scotty):

I want to roll seduction and do some dirty-talking, ideally as if the prospect of beating women and

forcing them in-line arouses her, to try and find out if Rickert really is that level of scumbaggery.

See if he really does that shit.(From Scotty):

Tell me what you got that would be an edge in this situation and I will give you the accorded bonuses.Rickert:

One second.Rockett Rimjob:

Or if the bonuses are clearly defined, put a plus next to your roll.Rickert:

So at least a +8.

"You want me to tell you all about how I put on a show for a pretty young thing and lead her back to my

Rickert slides a hand across Rockett's panties, if she's wearing any.(To Scotty):

"Might be some extra fun in it for ya if ya do... Jus' so happens Ah like mahself a good story~"
Said Rockett

She guides his hand along as he does -- she's wearing dainty panties, soft, smooth, and

snug tight against her rear.

Rickert slides the troublesome garment down Rockett's shapely legs with experienced hands. His

eyes never break contact with Rockett's. Though his smile does get wider once Rockett's panties are around her

(To Scotty):

"Much like what I'm doing now."
Said Rickert

"Never woulda guessed..."
Said Rockett

"Anyone ever told you that you got mesmerizing eyes?"
Said Rickert

"Damn things won't let my poor little peepers go."

"Am Ah about ta get bit..~?"
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob feigns a gasp, jaw open wide, flaunting her purty mouth.

Rickert reaches a hand up and gently holds the side of Rockett's face. His palm slowly scraped down

over sun touched cheek, down the hollows of her throat, and stops just above the fullness of her bosom.

(To Scotty):

"You wanna get bit sugar?"
Said Rickert

"Cause you got ma rattle shakin'."

Rockett Rimjob looks at him with an absolutely lecherous countenance, letting out a hot breath right into

his face.

"Keep talkin', honeydoll..."
Said Rockett

"Oh I will sugar, don't you worry about that."
Said Rickert

"You want me to get back to my titillatin' tale?"
Said Rickert

"Or are you otherwise entertained?"

"A little chit-chat never hurt no-one..."
Said Rockett

Rickert uses one deft hand to unbuckle his black trousers. It takes a good tug to get them to

fall.When they pass his calves, something meaty, warm, and thick springs up into the crevice of Rockett's shapely

(To Scotty):

"Well, I decided to make little Miss Rita an offer she couldn't refuse."
Said Rickert

"Sweet things like that."

"Little girl's eyes got so wide."

"Like dinnerplates."

"Cute lil thang."

"...damn, you really are packin'..."
Said Rockett

"...so what'd little miss cute end up doin', then? She say yes?"

Without even so much as a hint or gesture from Rickert as to what to do, Rockett grinds

her ass up against his meat, arcing her back and subtly spreading her legs.

(From Rockett Rimjob):

Seduction roll, baby.Rickert:

It should be.Rickert:

"Course she did sugar."

"With a carrot like that danglin' in front of her."

"No kiddin'..."
Said Rockett

Rickert hums in pleasure as Rockett starts to grind on his tool. He gently undoes Rockett's shirt and

takes hold of her left breast with his hand. His fingers are calloused. They feel rough when tweaks Rockett's nipple

and squeezes her generous titflesh.

(To Scotty):

"I got her some cash and got her motivated towards my club."
Said Rickert

"So I could take care of her, proper like."

"She do good work?"
Said Rockett

"From what she showed me, I could tell she had talent."
Said Rickert

"Silvery voice."

"...and a golden throat."

She takes in a deep breath as he grabs her funbag, looking up at him over her shoulder

as her hips rock up and down. She keeps herself steady, hands planted on the mattress.

(From Rockett Rimjob):

"Knew how ta take it?"
Said Rockett

"Not at first, but she picked it up fast."
Said Rickert

"She...ascertained from my reactions, what was a good idea, and what was a bad idea."

Rickert continues to tease Rockett's breasts with gentle squeezes and pinches. He pulls his hips

back from hers slow, until the tip of his length is barely touching Rockett's hot mound.

(To Scotty):

"Take it y--nnh... y' had ta do some... convincin'? Lord knows throatin' don't come easy..."
Said Rockett

"Well, when you got money in one hand, fame in the other, and good looks..."
Said Rickert

Her body sloooowly pushes back, grinding Rickert's head against her sex, slipping along

her lips and slickening it with her juices. She doesn't give him the pleasure of penetration, however -- once their

hips meet, he'd feel the soft skin of her belly on his length.

(From Rockett Rimjob):

"It tends to make the convincin' a little easier."
Said Rickert

"You bad little girl, playing with me like that."

"I'll have to return the favor."

"Money's a hell of a talker..."
Said Rockett

"...maybe Ah jus' wanna have some fun~"

Rickert's finger slides over Rockett's dripping cunny. He finds her button after a few seconds of

stroking and begins to run a light finger over it. The mattress squeaks as he shifts and the finger against her

button is replaced by an agile tongue.

(To Scotty):

"Well maybe..."
Said Rickert

Rickert takes a nice, long, langorous lick of Rockett's sizzling slit.(To Scotty):

"I can help you out with that."
Said Rickert

Alright.

We'll do the rest of that later.

It is time.

For other stuff.

Callie and Cassie find the re-purposed marshalry close to Doc Mitchell's cabin. There are guns sticking out the

sides of it and a pile of broken chairs, desks, and other junk laying out. There is not much else around.

Cassie-May O'Brien made a white flag from her shotgun and her NICE white Sunday shirt.

(Checklist, can you see, does everything look alright, and draw Fate Chips.)

Nothing obscures view. I can see the inside from here.Cassie-May O'Brien:

frustration

Would you be opposed to a short break while I figure out why it's doing that?

A short one, sure.Cassie-May O'Brien:

it's 1:45 AM here.

Go ahead. Though I gotta leave for work in 2 and a half hoursCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

Can you reset my cards? I accidentally the deck

I now have.

Dynamic lighting enabled.

YayCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

Is everything work?

Looks like itCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

looks like itCassie-May O'Brien:

Cassie-May O'Brien raised the shotgun-and-sunday-shirt white flag up and waved it

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers smirks and steps forward, whistling the tune to "Dixie"

Manson strolls around the corner of the building with a rifle stock pressed to his shoulder. He looks like

he's wearing a mask, but he's cut a hole in the mouthpiece tor a cigarette.

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers gives him a small wave as she approaches, hands nowhere near her gun or

whip. "Howdy there!"

Manson shakes his head until the smoking cigarette drops from his mouth. He puts the sights of his rifle

on Callie.

"Business?"
Said Manson

"Jus' here ta talk. We don' want no trouble now."
Said Callie

"Talk 'bout what?"
Said Manson

must feel a might far from home."

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"Feelin' fine."
Said Manson

"And I got enough bastard to shoot the shit with in there."

Manson jerks his head towards the building.

"So, you're looking like good target practice."
Said Manson

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers shows her star. "Y'all wouldn't shoot a Ranger down in cold blood, would ya?

Names Corporal Callie Mathers of the Texas Rangers."

Cassie-May O'Brien rests the butt of her shotgun on her hip, keeping the flag up.

Manson doesn't respond for a moment. The rifle moves a bit further back against his shoulder. Then, a

white gloved hand reaches around the building and touches the masked man on the shoulder.

"What?"
Said Manson

Manson lets the rifle drop to his side with clear irritation. He walks back around the side of the building. A

door slams loud enough for both Callie and Cassie to hear.

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers smirks. "Well, ain't he just a people-person?"

A man wearing a well pressed Confederate uniform walks around the corner of the

building. He has a pistol and saber belted to his hips. His mustache is impeccable. One white gloved hand raises

in greeting.

"Hello madam."
Said The

Cassie-May O'Brien wave-waves the flag a little, raising her eyebrows.

"I hope that I may apologize for the behavior of my man."
Said The

"He's been a little cagey, as of late."

"T'ain't nothin'. With times as they are, makes sense ta be a little wary."
Said Callie

"That it does."
Said The

"May I ask what a Ranger is doing around these parts?"

The Major strokes his mustache with one hand as he speaks.

"Jus' lendin' a helpin' hand ta the Marshalry. Ah could ask y'all the same question.

What's a buncha fine Southern folk doin' holed up in these parts?"

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

The Major lowers his head and grinds his boot into the dirt for a few moments. He raises his boot and

stamps the soil underneath him down flat. He raises his head back up.

"I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to say."
Said The

"Circumstances arose, and we were...called to action. Here."

"An' the hostility to the locals? Ah'm sure they'd be more'n willin' ta help if they didn't

have guns trained on 'em all the time."

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"A...precaution."
Said The

"What we are doing here is highly important."

"We can't have the locals interfering."
Said The

"Don' ya think that'll jus' draw more around or even worse, the local lawmen?"
Said Callie

"The local lawman has vacated his position."
Said The

"We are now the law in these parts."

bkCassie-May O'Brien:

"That's not how the locals are seein' it. Ah'm sure if ya talked to 'em that ya'd be able

ta let 'em know they gotta stay clear and there'd be far less trouble. 'Specially if ya got a Ranger backin' ya up."

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

The Major strokes his beard.

"Perhaps."
Said The

The Major points to Cassie.

"What affiliation is your friend there?"
Said The

"That's Cassie. She's also helpin' out the Marshalry. She'd jus' fine, far as Ah'm

The Major strokes his mustache for a solid minute.

"Miss Ranger, you may come inside."
Said The

"I'm afraid that I would be more comfortable with your friend outside."

"She can talk to Fenwick."

"Is that agreeable?"

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers thinks for a moment. "Cassie, that fine with ya?"

"Who's Fenwick again?"
Said Cassie-May

"He's our requisitions officer."
Said The

"...Uh."
Said Cassie-May

"Follow me, if you will."
Said The

The Major turns and walks around the corner of the building.

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers follows

"...keep her entertained."
Said The

"Oh, you know me."
Said Fenwick

"Always the ladies man."

"Miss... I didn't quite catch your name."
Said The

"Who,meh?"
Said Cassie-May

"I was interested in the Ranger."
Said The

"She told me your name, Miss Cassie."

"Ah'm Corporal Callie Mathers, sir. An' what might yer name be?"
Said Callie

"Major William Sutherland."
Said The

The Major extends a hand to the bald, heavily scarred man next to him.

"And this is mister Fenwick."
Said Fenwick

Fenwick gives a jerky wave.

"Pleased to meet yer."
Said Fenwick

"Cassie-May, sugercube. Pleasure's all mahne."
Said Cassie-May

"Aye, I'll be talking to you while Suthers gives the Ranger the run of our spot O' heaven here."
Said Fenwick

"Hope you don' mind."

"Nuthin' bad 'bout it, sugercube. Jus' git mah friend outta there in one piece, eh?"
Said Cassie-May

"Oh, she'll be fine."
Said Fenwick

"Long as she sticks with Suthers."

"He couldn' hurt a fly."

'"Aw shucks, so tha' 'stache ain' jus' fer show?"Cassie-May O'Brien:

Fenwick walks out and leans against the stone wall.

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers nods and steps inside

"I hit a target this week."
Said The

"I might even hit two."

"...Think Ah can git this down now,"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien put her shoygun between her legs and untied the white blouse off it.

The Major throws out a hand towards the young soldier sitting on the bench just inside.

"This is Mannok, he's the only private in our unit. Little skittish sometimes, but a good boy."
Said The

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers tips her hat to him. "Howdy."

Mannok looks up to Callie. His eyes have obvious bags under them. His head nods its way back down a

second later.

Cassie-May O'Brien folded her blouse and stuffed it back in her backpack.

"...So, quartermaster, eh?"
Said Cassie-May

"He's just a little tired is all."
Said The

"Come along now."

The Major strides further into the building.

"Aye, I handle all the goods 'round this crew."
Said Fenwick

"What d'ye do with yerself?"

Cassie-May O'Brien put her shotgun back in the sling, then shrugged.

"Taggin' 'long mah friend, lookin' fer trouble an' a penny ta come mah way. Yew know how it

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"This is Mister Mundt."
Said The

"He's our resident scientist."

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers tips her hat to him as well

Mundt Fedler turns to look at Callie. His gloves are stained with black grease, as is the rest of him.

"Guten tag, frau."
Said Mundt

Mundt Fedler turns back to the Gatling gun and continues greasing the mechanisms with a curious little

"Aye, I know better than most."
Said Fenwick

"Why d'ye think I'm the one that handle all the goodies?"

"Skim a little milk offa top sometime."

"Part and parcel of tha job."

"I believe you've already met Mister Manson."
Said The

"Eeeeyup. Think y'all got some fags in tha' skimmed milk, sugercube?"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien grinned.

"Coulda share a smoke."
Said Cassie-May

Manson doesn't look up. He concentrates on guzzling the contents of a large brown jug.

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers nods. "Yep, gave us quite the welcome."

Fenwick sighs theatrically and digs around in his interior coat pocket.

"AH suppose."
Said Fenwick

Fenwick pulls out a crinkled rolling paper and a tin of tobacco. He has a cigarette rolled up in under a

"Musta git boring 'ere."
Said Cassie-May

The Major walks a little bit further, closer to the cots set up at the back wall.

"And the two wonderful men operating the Gatling guns."
Said The

"Mayesby and Jeziah."

"Right pleasure Miss."
Said Mayesby

"Always did respec' the Rangers."

Mayesby touches the brim of his hat in reverence.

"Didn't happen to bring any booze with her did she?"
Said Jeziah

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers smiles. "Ya flatter me, sir. An' Ah don' have any drinks, but Ah do have a couple

"Shiiiit, I don't smoke."
Said Jeziah

"Thas Manson."

"We 'ave our fair share a excitement."
Said Fenwick

Fenwick offers the cigarette to Cassie.

"Realleh now? Ah coulda use a gewd story!"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien took it gratefully and put in her mouth, lighting up with a match she produced out.

"Nex' time Ah'm in town, Ah'll see if Ah can't get someone ta bring some drinks up

courtesy of the Rangers."

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"That would be mighty kind of you Miss Caliie, but I couldn't impose so upon you."
Said The

"We will do just fine by ourselves up here."

"Aye, had a lil show t'other day."
Said Fenwick

"Show?"
Said Cassie-May

"Middle of the night Sally starts screaming 'er fookin' head off."
Said Fenwick

"She's one a them..."

"Splosive specialist."

"Wouldn't be no trouble fer me. Plus, you boys look a might thirsty."
Said Callie

The Major puts one hand to Callie's shoulder.

"I'm afraid I must refuse."
Said The

"It would be against my honor to accept a gift without giving one in return."

"Whut wuz she screamin' fer?"
Said Cassie-May

"Danno."
Said Fenwick

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers thinks for a minute. "How's about this then. If yer willin' ta talk to the locals an'

work somethin' out so they don' see y'all as jus' some Rebs holed up with some guns, Ah'll make sure

y'all have plenty of drinks fer however long yer in the area."

"Monster, eh?"
Said Cassie-May

"I'm sure some understanding can be reached with the locals."
Said The

"You needn't worry on that account."

"Aye."
Said Fenwick

"Teeth like a tiger."

"And it left a smell around like a weeks worth of latrine mess."

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers smiles and holds out her hand. "Then is that a deal?"

"...Huh. How big wuz it?"
Said Cassie-May

"Of course Miss Callie."
Said The

"A deal."

The Major offers his hand.

"Feck, I dunno."
Said Fenwick

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers shakes it

"Wasna there ta see it."
Said Fenwick

"...Hurm."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien digs through her mental library of critters. Rings any bells?

"I take it everything was to your satisfaction?"
Said The

Sounds like something out of a book you read once.

Now what was it...

Occult roll?Cassie-May O'Brien:

Yep.

Cassie-May O'Brien:+02

"Course. Ah figgered everythin' was jus' some big misunderstandin'. An' Ah'm glad

we could come ta a peaceful resolution."

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

(Gotta get ready for work before too long. Also, should I get pizza or wings for my 12-

hour shift?)

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"Wonderful Miss Callie."
Said The

"I shall see you to the door."

"...Sounds like sumthin' outta vampire storybook."

"Nah shit?"
Said Fenwick

"Ah know on a good authority."
Said Cassie-May

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers tips her hat. "Ah hope ta hear that y'all and the locals have settled things soon,

"Goodbye Miss Callie, I'm sure we'll see each other again."
Said The

The Major doffs his cap and holds it to his chest.

"Gonna hafta see if she'll let me take a slice of 'er peach cobbler."
Said Fenwick

"Fer right price?"
Said Cassie-May

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers smiles and steps out. "Until nex' time, Major!"

"Indeed."
Said The

"I'm sure she has places to be."0

"Keap yer panties on ye pushy blighter."
Said Fenwick

"Hyuk!"
Said Cassie-May

Fenwick bows in front of Cassie.

"Cheers for now girl."
Said Fenwick

"Thanks fer sumthin' ta put in mah mouth, sugercube."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien moved the cigarette from one corner of her mouth to the other and offered a

Fenwick shakes Cassie's hand with vigor.

"Not a problem."
Said Fenwick

"Give ye somethin' else ta stick in, if ye want."

"Yew wish, eh?"
Said Cassie-May

Fenwick grins. His scars stand out when he grins. Ugly red things around the side of his mouth and

around his eyes. He reaches a hand up to touch the brim of an invisible cap and departs.

That's all for now.

"...So, y'all got anythin' useful, Callie?"
Said Cassie-May

"Yep. Seems ta all be a misunderstandin' an' they're gonna talk to the locals, try ta

sort everythin' out."

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"Mighta git their quartermaster on mah poon."
Said Cassie-May

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers chuckles. "Ah'd expect that from Rockett, not from you."

"She's bad influence."

Alright.

Extra stuff done.

Wonderful Cowboy Land brings WHitney a long, tall, cool, glass of water. A slight frown creases his face

as he sets it down in front of the adventist.

"Thank you..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen grasps the small glass in her much larger hands

"Nothin' else...?"
Said Bartender

"...do you...do you sell Cider by chance?"
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen carefully lifts the glass up to her lips

Whitney G. Elieen sips

"I got a couple kegs."
Said Bartender

"I would like one glass of Cider please."
Said Whitney

Bartender strolls a few feet over and grabs a mug off the bar's counter. He bends down. Gurgling noises

drift up from under the edge of the bar.

Whitney G. Elieen takes another sip before setting the glass down

Whitney G. Elieen takes a deep breath in

Whitney G. Elieen slowly lets it out

Bartender comes back up with a frothy mug. He walks back over to Whitney and sets it down in front of

her. The crackle of carbonation is still audible.00000

"Quarter."
Said Bartender

Whitney G. Elieen gives him said quarter

"God bless."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen slides the water away and replaces with the apple drink

Bartender slides the quarter across the wooden counter top. The shining piece of currency slips into his

apron pocket with a difficult to discern whisper of metal on cloth.

The froth in the mug is settling out a little. The actual liquid is a pale yellow filled with

tiny bubbles.

Whitney G. Elieen stares at the bubbly drink in the mug, almost mesmerized by the carbonation as she

lifts the glass slowly up to her lips.

Whitney G. Elieen closes her eyes and mumbles to herself. A silent prayer perhaps before she lifts it to

her lips and drinks deeply.

The liquid tickles the tongue as it flows down. There is a slight burn to it, but it is

difficult to feel amidst the tickling bubbles. Sweet and bright, with a minute bitterness that follows behind. The drink

feels autumnal as the red and orange of dying leaves.

"Good?"
Said Bartender

Whitney G. Elieen sets the glass down after a time. She would drink this as sensibly as she could. There

was a certain beauty to the drink. One that called to mind thoughts of autumn. Of falling leaves and dying

Whitney G. Elieen looks up and smiles

"Yes...very."
Said Whitney

Bartender gives a short grunt of approval. His idle hands grab an empty mug off the counter. He grabs a

stained white cloth off his shoulder and begins polishing the mug.

"I imagine this drink is popular this time of year. I think I like it better than the others..."
Said Whitney

"Popular all year round."
Said Bartender

"After years of drinking water alone, it feels refreshing to have something different."
Said Whitney

"Mmmm."
Said Bartender

"Only water?"

"Only water."
Said Whitney

"The body is a temple. I try to tend to it well."

"Hmmm."
Said Bartender

"Why the change?"

"...lately things have become stressful."
Said Whitney

"More than usual I should say."

"I like to think God allows these indulgences from time to time for her servants."

"Maybe."
Said Bartender

"More stressful?"

"Yes..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen glances down at the drink in her hands

Whitney G. Elieen slowly raises it for another sip

"More stressful...far more stressful."
Said Whitney

"Mmmm."
Said Bartender

"Do what I can to help."

There's not much left in the mug Whitney. Conservative drinking and eating was never

your strong suit. It isn't helped by the thirst and hunger that matches your size.

"..."
Said Whitney

"May I have another please?"

Bartender takes the mug and looks into it for a long second. He shrugs, walks over to the keg under the

Whitney G. Elieen grabs the newly filled mug

Whitney G. Elieen brings it to her lips

Whitney G. Elieen drinks again

Whitney G. Elieen sets it down after a hearty "sip"

"..."
Said Whitney

(To GM) rolling 1d10

"Do you have a larger cup?"
Said Whitney

(To GM) rolling 1d10

Whitney, you just drank the entire mug.

"I think...I will take one more. One large mug."
Said Whitney

"Sometimes it is difficult being my size."00

Bartender looks at the empty mug for a bit longer this time.

"Right."
Said Bartender

Bartender ransacks the bartop for a larger mug, ensures it is clean, and fills it full of cider. He sets it down

before Whitney two seconds later. He keeps a wary eye on her.

"Quarter for the last mug."
Said Bartender

"Half dollar for this one."

Whitney G. Elieen sets the money down on the counter

"Thank you...and God bless."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen grabs the much larger mug

Whitney G. Elieen brings it up to her lips

Whitney G. Elieen drinccs

Whitney G. Elieen takes another long drink

(To GM) rolling 1d10

That drink is far more conservative. You still have some left after.

Whitney G. Elieen sets it down after one good sip. There was still some left in the mug at least...

"...have things always been so strange around here?"
Said Whitney

"The risen dead. Demons. Revenants..."
Said Whitney

Bartender shrugs his wide shoulders.

"Heard all sorts a stories."
Said Bartender

"Before an after the quake."

"The end times approach. The time of the second coming is close."
Said Whitney

"But why now? Why this time? I serve the will of God, yet I can't confess to know her thinking."

Whitney G. Elieen takes another drink of her sweet and bitter beverage

(To GM) rolling 1d10Bartender:00

Aaaaand it's gone.

"...If only God has given me the ability to refill my drink."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen says as she sets it down

"Y'tried askin'?"
Said Bartender

"..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen closes her eyes for a moment and mumbles a prayer

"Just this once Lord. Let me give him a sign...and give myself one more good sip"

"Marshal your faith, my child."

Whitney G. Elieen smiles...

"...Thank you Lord. You really are the best."
Said (From

Whitney G. Elieen wraps her hands around the humming mug00000

Whitney G. Elieen lifts it up

Bartender watches with interest as the mug fills of its own accord and Whitney lifts it into the air.

"Sage advice. All I needed was to ask."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen lifts it to her lips and drinks

Whitney G. Elieen sets the holy mug down soon after

(To GM) rolling 1d10

Whitney G. Elieen slides it over to the bartender, along with another half dollar. "Care for a drink?"

Bartender takes the half dollar, keeping his hand well away from the mug.

"I'm good."
Said Bartender

"There are times when I doubt my place here...when everything seems so..."
Said Whitney

"Terrible. Frightening."

"And every time God has shown me she can still do better."

"Seems to've taken a shine to you."
Said Bartender

"She has. She has shown me so many wonderful things...and has let me do my fair share as

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Five years of wandering alone, ever since my family's ascension. God is the one thing that has kept me

"She has blessed me with her power. Blessed me with company, with food and drink whenever I need it."

"Maybe someday she will..."

Whitney G. Elieen grips the mug

Whitney G. Elieen pulls it to herself

"Will?"
Said Bartender

"Maybe someday she will bless me with my family back too."
Said Whitney

"It seems impossible now but..."

Whitney G. Elieen runs a hand across the humming glass

"Some things ain't meant to come back once they're gone."
Said Bartender

"It is not my parents that I refer to."
Said Whitney

"Their time here has ended long ago."

"A sister. Someone I was close to..."
Said Whitney

"Now?"
Said Bartender

"..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen shifts her eyes downward

Whitney G. Elieen grips the mug with both her hands

"...she is like a stranger to me now."
Said Whitney

"And to her I am worse."

"Hmmm."
Said Bartender

"How you gonna fix it?"

"...first Corinthians 13.2. If I do not have love, I have nothing. I can move mountains, restore

entire legs, command the earth and the sky..."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"...fill my drink back up and imbue this mug with holy power."

"...but without love it is nothing. I do not know."

"It will be a miracle if I can, and not of the kind you have seen just now."

"...how can I fix it? She hates me. She hates all that I believe in. I want desperately for things to be right

again...but no love, no dice."

"What's got between you and her love?"
Said Bartender

"She came to me once, seeking asylum. I gave her...a poor answer. I thought I was helping

her...but I did just the opposite."

Whitney G. Elieen:

Whitney G. Elieen lifts her hair up to show the scar that it hides

"All other scars have healed. The ones father gave me. The ones I gain now. All but this one."
Said Whitney

Bartender peers at the scar. One hand rubs his chin as he does.

"What can you do to make it right?"
Said Bartender

"...I do not know. My faith angers her. My presence angers her. I want to set it right but I don't

know what to say."

Whitney G. Elieen:

Whitney G. Elieen lets the hair fall back down.

"I want to tell her that I am sorry. That I didn't mean to hurt her so. But...she will not listen. Not

to me."

Whitney G. Elieen:

Whitney G. Elieen grabs the mug

"Not anymore"
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen pulls it to her lips again

(To GM) rolling 1d10Bartender:

The mug stays full. Just as full as it started, it seems.

"Ain't gonna be just words."
Said Bartender

"Needs action."

"A different kind than just healing her wounds or a never ending mug of cider I take it."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen says as she sets the still full mug down

"My advice?"
Said Bartender

"Hmmm?"
Said Whitney

"Price needs to be paid."
Said Bartender

"In the currency everyone understands."

"..." She casts her eyes once more to the mug as she lifts it up. "...I have suffered plenty over

the years."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Suffer for her?"
Said Bartender

"..."
Said Whitney

"...I would. Something tells me I will."

"Hmmm."
Said Bartender

"Thas my advice."

"I didn't start drinking until I met with her again. I feel I am already walking down that road."
Said Whitney

"...but it is a road I will travel. If it means..."

Whitney G. Elieen drinks

"It's easy drinking."

"Of course...sorry. Didn't mean to poke old scars. Meant no offense to you. Don't want

to make it a habit of offending the actual God of the universe after all."

We have several individuals.

Begin the ritualistic drawing of Fate Chips.

And now, for the Irish chip...

I'm gonna.

Have to fix that deck.

It's too nice.

Too nice to some people.

Did everyone draw their Fate chips and note them down on their sheets?

Read the bok.

i didn't leave

Okey dokey cowpokies.

Do you got.

Your chips notated?

I dunno.

Because Whitney is our tank and spiritual leader

and Yupo is best mascot

I nominate Applejack

The Marshalry Squad, patent pending, has been sitting at the bar discussing their next

move. Three obvious options present themselves. Go see the patient at Doc Mitchell's and see if you can get

some info out of her. Further investigate the disappearance of the town marshal, Sydney Gallows. Third option is

to get really drunk and have a duel with each other.

Can we do 3, 1, and then 2?Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

Well.

You're the players.

You tell me.

I'm just a skyskull.

Anyone else got something to add?Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

Make a plan on how to kill the magic ghost man?Alexander Hauswald:

It's not.

It's option three.

"...We got answers on how to kill that thing."
Said Alexander

Bartender polishes a mug behind the bar. He kicks the kegs under it off and on to sound out how full they

"Answers aside from 'Jus' shoot it a lot an' hoipe it stays down'?"
Said Callie

"... It's something like that."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald touches his chest with one finger.

"We need to put a bullet right in its heart or it'll come back."
Said Alexander

"That Ah can do."
Said Callie

"That is nebulous. What is its definition of a 'bullet?' If someone used a shotgun, and a

single pellet struck, would that be sufficient?"

Crystal Saint Claire:

"... When in doubt, use a revolver."
Said Alexander

"One of us gonna challenge it to a duel. maybe?"

"An' when that gun don' work, use more gun."
Said Callie

"...if someone duels it, they will most likely die..."
Said Crystal

"Depends. How quick's it on the draw?"
Said Callie

"I think we MIGHT be able to kill it."
Said Alexander

"Nobody said duel's gotta be fair."

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers smirks. "Ah like the way you think."

Bartender lifts a keg out from under the bar and rests it on his shoulder. He walks through the door into

the backroom with it.

"...So. What're we going to do now?"
Said Alexander

"Drink?"
Said Callie

"I... think we should search for Marshall Gallows..."
Said Crystal

"...Let's drink when we're done with this, Mathers."
Said Alexander

"If I shoot it dead, you pay. If you shoot, I pay. Deal?"

"Deal."
Said Callie

"...what if I shoot it?"
Said Crystal

"We both pay?"
Said Callie

"We'll cross that bridge when we get there."
Said Alexander

Distinctly audible, but muffled by the walls of the bar, are two explosions.

(BRB)Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"...What in the hell...?"
Said Alexander

They came from outside.

Crystal Saint Claire immediately checks her bag.

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire heads outside to investigate.

"...We're going."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald pulls his revolver and exits stage left. Potentially pursued by bear.

Whitney, Callie, and Nephi, are unfortunately passed out drunk.

Who got Whitney DrunkAlexander Hauswald:

Whitney's passed out drunk?Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire is concerned, now, about leaving her alone...

The two of you walk outside.

I was completely unaware she was drinking this much!Crystal Saint Claire:

Callie should follow you out in a moment.

Crystal Saint Claire looks around, but is mostly blind.

Alexander Hauswald scans the skyline for any obvious indicators- smoke, fire, people running and

Crystal Saint Claire is probably pretty good at detecting lingering explosion aromas though

Roll tracking Alex, and Crystal.

I don't got tracking.Alexander Hauswald:

Do I just roll 4d6?Alexander Hauswald:

Then roll Cognition.

Alexander Hauswald:+01+0307

The two of you can hear faint reverberations Northwest. A little ways out of the main

town. A faint plume of smoke rises from somewhere out that way.

"That way!"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire pojnts and takes off running as fast as her little legs will take her

Alexander Hauswald starts running!

Callie still lags behind a little ways, but Alex, Sacks, and Crystal make it to the site of

the explosion within a few minutes.

Wonderful Cowboy Land:00

Something feels...wrong.

"...I got a bad feeling about this."
Said Alexander

"What happened here?"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire moves closer to investigate...

"Let's hope we stay alive after finding out."
Said Alexander

Both of you can see a pile of wood and paper scraps. Broken chairs, desks, and the

There are a few boarded up windows on this side of the building.

"...Sacks, go check it."
Said Alexander

The boards appear loose, like the nails were rattled half out.

"....Rrrruff."
Said Sacks

Sacks proceeds to reluctantly look around.

There's an ammunition box blown out of a small slit in the building.

Fifty caliber round.

The slit looks to have been busted out with a pickaxe.

"...Looks like... Someone broke in to steal ammo?"
Said Alexander

Sacks sniffs around for any trails or clues.

Sacks.

You can smell iron in the air.

There's the tingling smell of gunpowder too.

"...Firefight, too. Someone shot their gun."
Said Alexander

Crystal Saint Claire takes a look at this pile of rubble

"Stay on your toes, kid."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald checks with Sacks around the corner.

Crystal Saint Claire raises up onto her tip-toes

There's a couple caselogs from decades ago.Wonderful Cowboy Land:0

"...this solves nothing"
Said Crystal

She'll take them, just in case.

Into the bag they go

You now have dusty caselogs

There's a Gatling gun poking out through the slit of the wall.

"... Uh."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald tries to see if there's any slits that aren't occupied by guns he can peer into from.

"What? What is it?"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire tries tugging at the gun

There's the one you're next to.

But there's...something blocking it.

Alexander Hauswald holds his revolver at the read and pokes said thing

Crystal Saint Claire inspects Big Gun

It squishes a little bit.

Your revolver comes back red.

"...Someone's dead."
Said Alexander

"Try to find me an entrance, kid."

Alexander Hauswald tries to push the gatling gun back in so he could look.

The gun is well maintained Crystal, but otherwise unremarkable.

You push, but other than more squishiness, the blockage is not moving.

"...Yeah, go find an entrance."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald seeks more slits throughout the length of the wall, also seeking a way in.

Does it look like it's been used recently?Crystal Saint Claire:

Alexander Hauswald would go for man-sized and dog-sized holes.

Nope.

Hm.Crystal Saint Claire:

Guts Check Alex.

Crystal Saint Claire tries to pull it away from the window

Alexander Hauswald:+02+01

Alex, you can barely hold your bile in.

There's a young...Confederate?

It's hard to tell.

The uniform is soaked through with blood.

He's been torn in half.

Alexander Hauswald 's stoic facade breaks, for just a moment.

Ragged stripes of flesh still connect the two parts of him, but that's about it.

"...Holy..."
Said Alexander

"Good news, found an entrance."

"Bad news, don't come near it."

Sacks hesitantly walks in.

"...why not?"
Said Crystal

"Is it trapped?"

"I don't want to answer that question."
Said Alexander

Crystal Saint Claire goes to look for Hauswald to ask him while she can see him work on the trap

There are more corpses around this side Sacks.

You can see the source of the blockage.

Something pinned a man to the wall with the butt of a Gatling gun.

His hands are resting on it.

"Maybe I can help! I am much smaller, so I would be less likely to trigger any weight-based

Crystal Saint Claire:

Seems he tried to pull it out of his own chest before he died.

"Sir?"
Said Crystal

"Please, please don't look at this."
Said Alexander

You heard a ruckus while...entertaining someone, and came to investigate.(To Scotty):0

"What do you think caused the explosion?"
Said Crystal

Alexander Hauswald walks in. And tries to yank the gun out so the man can lie down in peace.

"I'll check. But... It's pretty gruesome here."
Said Alexander

It ain't budging.

one tic, game machine broke(From Scotty):

Crystal Saint Claire tries to enter.

You can hear some sloshing sounds, and something pink falls out and hits the floor.

"...Didn't think it so either, Sacks-"

Roll Medicine.

Rockett Rimjob inspects.

But you swallow it back down.

Crystal Saint Claire spits it out.

Crystal Saint Claire does not swallow bile

"...Yeah."
Said Alexander

bad for the pipes.Crystal Saint Claire:

Oh yeah Alex, that's looks like a bit of intestines.

Severed just at the duodenum.

Rockett looks at this thing sticking out of the wall(From Rockett Rimjob):

Did it fall out of Mr. Gun?Alexander Hauswald:

Yes.

Crystal Saint Claire checks out this desk and OH GOD A CORPSE

"...I don't know what did this."
Said Alexander

"I don't think I wanna know."

Crystal Saint Claire jumps back and almost screams

"But I really want to let this man be dead with dignity."
Said Alexander

It looks to be the butt end of some gun, torn up to hell. Crimson fluid has dribbled down from it onto

the ground.

(To Scotty):

"... Over here, kid."
Said Alexander

Crystal, Guts Check.

fuuuuckCrystal Saint Claire:

I guess0

It's alright.

It's alright.

You've seen books with dead things in them before.

(I FEAR NOTHING, says local little girl)Alexander Hauswald:

But.

She just didn't expect something to be in that corner.Crystal Saint Claire:

They didn't have their legs sitting a few feet away from them.

A huge hole in their chest where the heart should be.

"...This wasn't a fight."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald tries to yank harder.

"...check them."
Said Crystal

"For hearts."

She pushes on the butt end of the gun.(From Rockett Rimjob):

Strength Alex.

"This was a fucking massacre."

"This one... is missing his."

"WHAT THE FU-"

"Hauswald? Are you all right?"
Said Crystal

Just two guns and a knife Crystal.

Said Crystal

"...I'm fine."
Said Alexander

"I'm fine."

Are the bodies armed?Crystal Saint Claire:

"We got a gun."

Yes.

Alexander Hauswald tries to see if the dead man has a heart.

The chain gun slides around in its slit, and rotates smooth as butter. Nothing else too remarkable.(To Scotty):

Crystal Saint Claire investigates these weird cake things

He has a heart still.

Though it appears to have been filtered through the chain gun's barrels.

"This one's got a heart, kid."
Said Alexander

It now resembles something like pate.

Said Alexander

That's the remains of an explosion Crystal.

Alexander Hauswald examines the explosion remains.

You can't keep it in. You've seen death before, but...this is worse.(To Scotty):

You retch onto the side of the building for a minute. After looking at the two halves of the Confederate

boy and the ragged flesh still connecting one part to the other.

"The thing that caused this explosion was SUPPOSED to explode"
Said Crystal

or something00

Well.

Rockett Rimjob audibly vomits outside with alarming volume.

Judging by the fact that the corpse pushed against the far wall has dynamite in his

It was probably that.

Ah.Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire investigates!

Alexander Hauswald looks around, maybe at the rectangles.

"So... whatever WAS killing them..."
Said Crystal

"I think... maybe this man killed it with dynamite? Or.. at least tried to?"

Does it look like he was killed by dynamite?

Or are there bullet holes in him, or big flesh rips

"...What the hell..?"
Said Rockett

He is missing the lower half of his body.

He looks like he got blown to shit and back.

"...Rockett? That you?"
Said Alexander

Crystal Saint Claire searches the guy's torso

"Why is he here..."
Said Crystal

"If he was the last to die, which he would have been if he'd resorted to trying to blow someone up with dynamite..."

There is a small book next to him.

"...yeah, Hauswald... heard some ruckus, then some not-ruckus."
Said Rockett

"Why didn't he run?"
Said Crystal

"...Christ above, tha hell happened here?"
Said Rockett

Crystal Saint Claire picks up the book.

"...Something... some massacre happened here."
Said Alexander

"Something killed all of them."
Said Crystal

Any luck on the rectangles?Alexander Hauswald:

"Ah can see that much."
Said Rockett

"One thing, likely."
Said Crystal

Those are cards Alex.

Oh.Alexander Hauswald:

Are they any magical or just normal cards?

Normal looking.

Two eights, both black and one ace of clubs.

...Crystal Saint Claire:

isn't that three-fifths of the Dead Man's hand?

I don't remember exactly

"Whoever tha hell did this, they were real keen on makin' a display."
Said Rockett

All that's missing is Club Ace and mystery card...Crystal Saint Claire:

I mean

Spade Ace.

That's three of the four known cards in the Dead Man's hand.

Does Crystal open the book?

"... Rockett, do me a favor and see if you can find another card somewhere."
Said Alexander

Yes.Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal's gonna take a look

in the book

Everything is written in code.

READING RAINBOOOOOOOWCrystal Saint Claire:

Except the last page.

"I'm curious about something."
Said Alexander

it is stuck together with congealing blood.

Crystal might have something in her little lab that could fix that.

Getting pages unstuck is prob'ly something most lab-workers have to do pretty often

especially if they can't see well enough to not knock things on their books sometimes.

"...Found something, kid?"
Said Alexander

"I don't know, one minute."
Said Crystal

tfw internetRockett Rimjob:

Can we try to open the pages?Crystal Saint Claire:

What do you do to open the pages?

"Sure. Ah'll go lookin'. What'cha need 'em for..?"
Said Rockett

Stop at the first sign it's not working.Crystal Saint Claire:

Barring that, wait, and steam the pages open later.

"Ask me again later."

"Or not at all, and I will inform you if anything comes of this."

"Black ace and any other card."
Said Alexander

"Unless you have a trick for getting blood out of paper."
Said Crystal

Alexander Hauswald looks around for any more possible clues.

Rockett Rimjob looks at the corpse at her feet.

Any success?(From Crystal Saint Claire):

(To GM) rolling 1d10

The papers come apart slow, but sure.

There is a word written on the last page.

In blood.

Let's see it.Crystal Saint Claire:

W h I T e

Crystal looks for something to hold the pages open.Crystal Saint Claire:

Rockett, this corpse has had both legs severed at about the knee.

And there is a massive, crudely hacked out hole where his heart should be.

A piece of wood or soemthing.Crystal Saint Claire:

You pick up a stick of dynamite and put it on the book.

Anything left for me to find?Alexander Hauswald:

There are weapons on each corpse, mostly one shot rifles and Colt Navys.

"...looks like someone had fun tearin' up through here..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob looks at the body, as well as the desk to her right.

The desk has two forty four caliber pistols on it, and a good Bowie knife.

Alexander Hauswald briefly ponders if picking up all these guns to loot them is a good idea.0

The corpse has a sawn off shotgun next to it.

Double barrel.

"We should probably go."
Said Crystal

"... It's disrespectful but these guns might be worth something."
Said Alexander

"I would say 'we need to collect them for the marshalls' but I just remembered we are the

Crystal Saint Claire:

"...At least one of the gatling guns. Maybe you could do something with it."
Said Alexander

You'll need two people to carry that.

Or one Rockett.

Alexander Hauswald ponders.

"...Thing we should ask Rockett or carry it ourselves?"
Said Alexander

Rockett Rimjob takes some time looking at the guns. She seems to really like the look of the double-

"...whoever rolled through here didn't do it fer tha money, that's fer sure."
Said Rockett

"Coulda bagged a lot of crap."

"Ghost?"
Said Rockett

"Ghost, likely not."
Said Crystal

"Or someone with very skewed priorities."
Said Alexander

"Well, grab what ya can. Not like these poor bastards are usin' 'em no more."
Said Rockett

"Not... GHOST, ghost."
Said Alexander

"Someone who came back."

"I almost hate to ask, but would someone mind checking some of the holes in them?"
Said Crystal

"For bullets?"

"....Bullets?"
Said Alexander

"Looks like someone just kinda went ham with some caveman bullshit."
Said Rockett

"...The man in the back... he used dynamite."
Said Crystal

"That would imply he was fighting something he believed guns wouldn't help against, likely because he had

watched his armed companions try to deal with them."

Rockett Rimjob looks at the mounted gatling.

Rockett Rimjob looks to see if there's a way to take it off the mount.

"I am unsure anything with thick enough armor, natural or otherwise, would be capable of

weidling a firearm with any degree of effectiveness."

Crystal Saint Claire:

You can probably just yank it out of the wall.

"..."
Said Alexander

Rockett Rimjob does so.

Alexander Hauswald examines the corpses for bullet holes.

SKRRRRRANK

Rockett is now the proud owner of a Gatling gun.

can I have control of it(From Rockett Rimjob):

Crystal Saint Claire makes an unholy shrieky scream

Rockett Rimjob looks at it.

"...wunner if it still works."
Said Rockett

Crystal Saint Claire tries to jump and run at the same time and trips

Rockett Rimjob looks at poor Crystal.

You gots it.(To Scotty):

Alexander Hauswald looks at Crystal, amused.

"...yeah that wus pretty loud.Rockett Rimjob:

Rockett Rimjob points the gun at the wall.

"..."
Said Crystal

"...Heh."
Said Alexander

Any bullet holes, Scotty?

The one I looked at just had a giant hole in its chest.Rockett Rimjob:

Not sure about the others.

Bullet holes. Not "got his heart torn out" holes.Alexander Hauswald:

If there were, Doc didn't mention 'em, so I'd assume not.Rockett Rimjob:

Rockett Rimjob checks to see if the darn thing is still loaded at all.

You gotta look for stuff.

Then I can mention it.

Unless you would notice it without putting effort into looking.

Looks like...yep.

Still loaded.

So were these dudes shot or not?Alexander Hauswald:

The one on the left looks like he got his leg torn off by a couple bullets.

There's some nice, big holes in his chest too.

"...One of them got shot."
Said Alexander

The one on the right got half of his head blown off.

"Make that both."
Said Alexander

"Worrying."
Said Crystal

"Even more so that there is no body to speak of..."

"Whatever this thing was, it had a gun."
Said Alexander

"How many shots?"
Said Rockett

"...And was pretty good at it."
Said Alexander

"We got a marksman?"
Said Rockett

"Enough to blow his face off and that man's leg off."
Said Alexander

"..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob thinks back to her friend that got blammo'd outside Mitchell's.

Crystal Saint Claire thinks about what Whitney would like for lunch

Alexander Hauswald thinks about something else.

That was more of a...precision shot. This is like using a grenade to crack eggs.(To Scotty):

"...Grab what you want and let's leave."
Said Alexander

"...yeah. Let's."
Said Rockett

"Try to see if any of these folks were lawmen, though."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald appropriates the two colt navies and the bowie knife.

Rockett Rimjob slipped the double-barrel on her hip when she picked it up.

Items get.

"...might not look tha best walkin' inta town with this."
Said Rockett

Alexander Hauswald snickers.

"Maybe Ah should slip a little more shoulder so tha boys got somethin' else ta look at."
Said Rockett

"Don't think anyone'll dare to tell you not to."
Said Alexander

Crystal Saint Claire is looking at the journal.

Alexander Hauswald makes one last round to see if any of them got, I dunno, a badge or a big sign that

says "WE WERE LAWMEN"

Crystal Saint Claire is more specifically looking at the code.

All of them look like Confederates.

From the uniforms.

Does it look like 1 thing = 1 letter?Crystal Saint Claire:

"...hey actually hold on."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob sets the gun down.

Rockett Rimjob looks for ammunition.

"What are you doing?"
Said Crystal

All of the boxes appear to be ammo for the Gatling.

Thirty shots to a box.

Fifty caliber.

All the grey boxes?Rockett Rimjob:

Yep.

You can probably carry one with the Gatling.

I can count eight in here, there was one outside too.Rockett Rimjob:

I take it I can't stuff all of it in my backpack like the TFN loot system.

Nope.

Can I help her carry some?Alexander Hauswald:

You can carry the Gatling and the rest of what you got.

"Need help?"
Said Alexander

Alex can carry two boxes, since he's not also going to be carrying a Gatling Gun.

"Grab a couple of them boxes. Gun ain't worth much if it ain't got bullets."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob grabs one (1) box.

Alexander Hauswald grabs two. Maybe straps one to Sacks, too.

Yes to the first.

Rockett Rimjob looks at the gatling gun.

Ha ha, no, to the second.

Rockett Rimjob cranks the crank and empties out whatever's still in the chambers.

Your dog is not that stronk.

Crystal Saint Claire is probably less strong than the dog

what do I roll?Rockett Rimjob:

Well, since you're not really shooting at anything.

You don't have to roll.

oRockett Rimjob:

I just unload it into the dirt, mostly to be safe.

You just get a sound effect.

tfw had R20 mutedRockett Rimjob:

Looks to have been about thirty shots.

ohai nevAlexander Hauswald:

Unmute it.

"...nyeheheh.Rockett Rimjob:

didRockett Rimjob:

I'm watching Super Mario Odyssey on the side and this invaded it and I was kinda "what"Alexander Hauswald:

Rockett Rimjob giggles when she's done shooting, looking down at the barrels.

Crystal Saint Claire dives under a desk

"...I was betting on seeing what Crystal can do with that."
Said Alexander

Smoke gently drifts from them.

The ends look a little hot.

You cranked that yank good.

"...Shit's funner'n chasin' baby chickies."
Said Rockett

"...Is that a euphmism for something?"
Said Alexander

"...No?"
Said Rockett

"You ever chased baby chicks?"

"When you was little?"

"I dissected one once."
Said Crystal

"...I was a bookish kid."
Said Alexander

"Yeah. Ah was too. Didn't stop me from chasin' birds."
Said Rockett

"Alright. Anyone got anything left here?"
Said Alexander

"...it was not a chick... it was a hen, but..."
Said Crystal

"...but yeah. Looks like this is all we gonna be able ta haul."
Said Rockett

Crystal Saint Claire peeks out from under the desk

"Get outta there, Crystal. Ah ain't gonna shoot ya."
Said Rockett

"Perhaps we should find a cart..."
Said Crystal

"You got one lyin' around?"
Said Rockett

"No, but we could find one in town..."
Said Crystal

"I could purchase it. Perhaps it could come in handy for travel."

"Could ask Mitchell an' bum off his.Rockett Rimjob:

"A wagon of sorts..."
Said Crystal

o yeah should I draw fate chips for this game?Rockett Rimjob:

Yes.

"...I'm tempted to just strap something to Sacks."
Said Alexander

DRAAAAAAW

...four whitesRockett Rimjob:

"...I know. I know, Sacks."
Said Alexander

("well ah'm kinda used ta gettin' screwed")Rockett Rimjob:

(...I swear it's like I only got lucky when nobody else did)Alexander Hauswald:

(Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"Strap a gatlin' gun to tha dog's back."
Said Rockett

(I got 2 reds and a blue. I'm ahppy with that)Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"Rapid-fire assault poocher."
Said Rockett

"...He likes that idea a bit too much."
Said Alexander

Mun

You have return.

"Let's hit tha road. Maybe Ah'll schmooze Doc an' use 'is wagon ta haul tha corpses an' supplies

back ta town."

Rockett Rimjob:

I've been here for a whileCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"Folks deserve a burial, an' Ah bet Mitchell could lookit these corpses better."
Said Rockett

Do you all head off to visi-

Just been talking to my boyfriendCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

Oh.

"Sounds like a good idea."
Said Alexander

Tell me when you get back next time.

So I can put you in the game.

So you can...play.

"Let's get a move-on then."
Said Rockett

I was RP'ing being passed out drunk. It's in characterCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"Please do not fire those again..."
Said Crystal

Rockett Rimjob starts walking, hefting her new weapon with a disconcerting, sinister joy.

Crystal Saint Claire is still poring over a blood-soaked journal.

(... what if rockett insists on getting that thing strapped to her abdomen)Alexander Hauswald:

whatCrystal Saint Claire:

(mah load's bigger'n yers)Rockett Rimjob:

(I dunno it's 3:25 AM and I'm making dumb thoughts)Alexander Hauswald:

(Rocket == Heavy Weapons Gal?)Crystal Saint Claire:

apparentlyRockett Rimjob:

she uses her fists as a melee weapon so that makes sense

all she needs now is a sandwich and russian heritage

All of you get to the clinic soon enough. You pick up Callie along the way there.

Seems she got distracted with arresting a couple hooligans desecrating a statue.

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers gives a low whistle of appreciation. "Sweet Mary, Joseph, and Jesus, Rockett."

Rockett Rimjob kicks the door open.

Rockett Rimjob stomps inside

(Hey look, it's Rockett's boyfriend)Alexander Hauswald:

"WHERE'S MAH MONEY MITCHELL"
Said Rockett

"I told you, you shouldn't be wal-"
Said Doc

Doc Mitchell looks over to Rockett.

"Howdy."
Said Doc

"...hey there."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob chuckles to herself.

"An' hello ta you too, Cal."
Said Rockett

"Ah got a new toy."

Crystal Saint Claire stays outside with the horse

"Ah can see that."
Said Callie

Rockett Rimjob sets it down with a thunk.

"I wouldn't recommend sticking that one anywhere it doesn't belong."
Said Doc

"Not medically safe and all."

"My favorite part about you, horse, is that you cannot operate a firearm, and are thusly

incapable of firing one at inopportune moments."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Ah'll tell ya what else ain't medically safe."
Said Rockett

"My next favorite thing is that you are a good listener."
Said Crystal

"Rockett, you wanna help me with this bookshelf?"
Said Doc

'Them fedders up there at tha prison got torn a new one."Rockett Rimjob:

"You hear 'bout 'em?" she asks, reaching down to lift the shelf.

"WHAT?"
Said Sackhead

"Who got...WHAT?"

"What happened?"

"Dunno."
Said Rockett

"Confederates got... slaughtered."
Said Alexander

"That's why Ah needa talk ta Mitchell."
Said Rockett

"Something shot them to death."
Said Alexander

"Reckon he's better at body-scannin' than Ah am."
Said Rockett

The shelf goes up with a little tugging.Sackhead:

"Could also use his wagon for a tic. They got some bodies an' gats that need haulin'."
Said Rockett

Sackhead tries to walks a few paces over to Rockett. She starts coughing halfway there and doubles

"You never put yourself in danger of an aneurism, scaring me half to death and almost

killing yourself to save someone who would have managed without you."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Truly ours is a relationship for the ages, horse."

"I'll, need a minute to get my things together."
Said Doc

(Crystal x horse OTP)Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"Careful, darlin'. You still look like you got some peroosin' ta do with Doc."
Said Rockett

"In another life, perhaps I will be a horse."
Said Crystal

"Talk to Shiela in the mean time."
Said Doc

"Sheila's her name, then."
Said Rockett

"Those were her folks."
Said Doc

"Hm."
Said Rockett

Doc Mitchell nods. He walks off to the back room a moment later and starts rustling around.

"..."
Said Alexander

"I should go inside. Thank you for listening to me."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire toddles inside.

"My condolences."
Said Alexander

"Wha' took ya?"
Said Callie

The horse snorts as Crystal leaves.

"One of theirs is here, right?"
Said Crystal

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers looks at Crystal

"A remnant of the confederates from that prison?"
Said Crystal

Sackhead recovers from her coughing spell.

"Yes."
Said Sackhead

"Yes...my name's Shiela."

Crystal Saint Claire waves the blood soaked journal with a stick of dynamite acting as abookmark.

"What...happened?"
Said Sackhead

"...sorry ta break tha news to ya."
Said Rockett

"This is in code. Would you look at it?"
Said Crystal

"We don't got no clue. Someone or some thing came in an' laid 'em all out."
Said Rockett

"Be careful, it is somewhat slippery."
Said Crystal

"..."
Said Sackhead

"...ain't none of them havin' open caskets. Ah don't think you wanna look."
Said Rockett

Crystal Saint Claire lays the book on the table.

Sackhead turns around, clenches her fist, and slams it against the stone slab operating table for a few

"They left... what I sure hope isn't a sign."
Said Alexander

in blood on the last page by the man in the impressive hat."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"...at least I believe it was him. He was closest to the book."

Sackhead turns back around. Her hand is swollen, and bloody. She tore through her glove and into her

"..."
Said Crystal

"I don't..."
Said Sackhead

"I don't know."

"Understandable."
Said Crystal

Sackhead grabs the book and flips it open.

is the journal in Confederate code or something? If so, maybe the resident Ranger

could decipher it...

(From Crystal Saint Claire):

"This is...or...was...The Major's."
Said Sackhead

"It's...his code."

"Did he tell you how to solve it?"
Said Alexander

"I know everything that's going to be in here already."
Said Sackhead

"Military code?"
Said Crystal

"He didn't keep a lot of secrets, from us."
Said Sackhead

"Look at the bookmarked page?"
Said Crystal

"Then why'd he'd right it in code?"
Said Alexander

Crystal Saint Claire flips it open to the page written in blood.

"..."
Said Sackhead

"Is this..."

"In case Yankees such as ourselves happened to come into contact withthe ournal."
Said Crystal

"The blood, or the handwriting?"

"To keep in practice."
Said Sackhead

"Either way, i do not know."
Said Crystal

"And because he didn't want anyone other than us nosing around in his journal."
Said Sackhead

"He was the only one near the journal, and it was his journal, so... I would assume it was

Crystal Saint Claire:

"You are not us."
Said Sackhead

"That is fair."
Said Crystal

"...We're Marshalls."
Said Alexander

"And I'm a Confederate."
Said Sackhead

"If we won't know we won't be able to put whoever did this to justice."
Said Alexander

"An Ah'm a Ranger."
Said Callie

"I could care less about the contents, honestly. If you want to just tell us anything written in

there that is relevant, and keep the journal... I would not object."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Congratulations."
Said Sackhead

Sackhead tucks the journal into an inside pocket of her coat.

"...Miss. Please."
Said Alexander

"Hauswald, don't be a jackass."
Said Rockett

"She can keep it."
Said Crystal

"If she don't wanna tell us, she don't have to. Not like it's gonna stop our searchin'."
Said Rockett

Sackhead produces an especially ragged cough.

"...I would not be able to break the code..."
Said Crystal

"Are you unwell?"

"Are they...all dead?"
Said Sackhead

"...poor woman's gotta heal. Don't need tha stress."
Said Rockett

Crystal Saint Claire looks concerned.

"How many of them were there?"
Said Alexander

"...How many of them were there?"
Said Crystal

"We counted six."
Said Alexander

"We found... six... and a half."
Said Crystal

"They are deader than dead. An' there wasn't a breathin' soul in tha whole place."
Said Rockett

"If there was anyone that didn't die, they ran, far an' fast."

"There were seven."
Said Sackhead

"Not including me."

"...Guess someone's alive?"
Said Alexander

So perhaps a survivor.Crystal Saint Claire:

"I feel that may be the key, deciphering what that means in context."

"Written in blood and all."

"Would you mind taking a look?"

"If not immediately, then... when you have the time?"
Said Crystal

"...yeah."
Said Sackhead

"Make sure no one touches that place."

"Will do."
Said Alexander

"Understood!"
Said Crystal

"We wanted to get the dead here so Doc could get a better look."
Said Alexander

"...Rockett you should probably put the gatling gun backCrystal Saint Claire:

"I don't give a shit about the guns."
Said Sackhead

"I give a shit about my friends."

"God KAAAF dammit."

"Rules of maritime salvage dictate you get the guns. Your friends are dead, you need every

advantage you can get."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Do you think I can carry a fucking Gatling gun?"
Said Sackhead

"I can barely carry my ass."

"Not for long, but money is nice."
Said Crystal

"You look like you got a decent throwin' arm."
Said Rockett

"Don't look healthy enough ta breathe, though. That's tha problem."

"You are sick right now, are you not?"
Said Crystal

"I got."
Said Sackhead

"My chest."

"Torn open."

"You're doing pretty well for someone who did."
Said Alexander

"That is a maybe."
Said Crystal

"Was gonna say. Most folks would've given up on breathin' with a hole like that."
Said Rockett

"You must be real stubborn."

(Something)Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

(That is the exact opposite of helpful)Crystal Saint Claire:

"...MInd if I be rude and ask..."
Said Alexander

"What exactly tore your chest?"

"God and the Devil can both suck my clit."
Said Sackhead

"I didn't wanna die."

Sackhead turns to Hauswald with her begoggled face. Light glints off the tinted glass.

"Why would you give 'em tha pleasure..?"
Said Rockett

"Big, white...thing."
Said Sackhead

"Long teeth."

"Smelled like shit and Shinola mixed together."

"... White."
Said Alexander

"...white."
Said Crystal

Sackhead turns back to Rockett.

"Perhaps it returned?"
Said Crystal

Alexander Hauswald tries to remember if he ever heard of something like that.

"But there were bullet holes in some of the men..."
Said Crystal

"Not about my pleasure, I'm bettin' both of them are hell on wheels for eating carpet."
Said Sackhead

Rockett Rimjob chuckles at that. "Ah like yer attitude."

"Thanks."
Said Sackhead

"You're part of a privileged few."
Said Sackhead

"...Anything else you remember about it? I know about.... unusual things like that."
Said Alexander

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers checks her Ranger's Bible for anything like that

"I think it...had a gun in one hand when it was trying to tear my everything out."
Said Sackhead

"Hard to tell."

"There was a lot of my blood all over."

Had a gun.

does size affect token size(From Rockett Rimjob):

"... White, long teeth, smelled horrid, had a gun..."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald ponders harder.

(A hillbilly klansman?)Alexander Hauswald:

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers flips through the pages of her Ranger's Bible. Is there anything like that in it?

Yes.(To Scotty):

"White fur, or something else?"
Said Crystal

It should, how big is Rockett again?(To Scotty):

"Skin."
Said Sackhead

"...How white?"
Said Alexander

"Do you remember anything else about its face other than teeth? hair? eyes? Did it wear clothes?"

"..."
Said Crystal

I forget if she has a +1 or 2(From Rockett Rimjob):

Crystal Saint Claire realizes something.

Crystal Saint Claire loses control of her legs, and hits the ground.

"We talkin' hick, Swede, or albino white?"
Said Rockett

"Baby batter white."
Said Sackhead

"... Right. Did the gun have anything special to it?"
Said Alexander

"Old."
Said Sackhead

"Looked small caliber."

Crystal Saint Claire has buried her head in her knees, curled tight in a ball.

"...Maybe something like..."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald looks at Crystal.

"...Cedric?"
Said Alexander

"Who the fuck is Cedric?"
Said Sackhead

"Someone who didn't know how to stay dead. Nearly chewed all of our faces off."
Said Alexander

"...If we take you to the cemetary and show you what's left of it, will you tell us if it's that?"

"...Assuming it didn't get up and leave."

"Fine, yeah."
Said Sackhead

"...There's too many damn dead things getting up lately."
Said Alexander

Rockett Rimjob gives Sacks scritches.

Sacks wags his tail happily!

it is 7(From Rockett Rimjob):

she has +1(From Rockett Rimjob):

(I would not.)Crystal Saint Claire:

(So the others don't get too behind)Sackhead:

Time for outro.

Strange things are afoot, and all of you seem to be a few steps behind this new one.

Crystal is thinking Inyanga is back...(From Crystal Saint Claire):

The massacre, the missing marshal, and every inexplicable thing in between.

Are they connected, or is this just a series of unfortunate events?

Time will tell.

Be sure that it doesn't toll your end first.

(Night)Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

A lot of music.

What kind do you want?

The kind that says

"They have taken the bridge… and the second hall. We have barred the gates… but cannot hold them for long.

The ground shakes. Drums… drums… in the deep. We cannot get out. A shadow moves in the dark. We cannot

get out… They are coming."

That kinda music.

I have other requests

For later

This is pretty spot-on.

"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get

its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is

Poage places on shelf

Yuppie b. is shelved

Poage uses Yupo as bookend, with Evil Twin Opuy!

This is all but LITERALLY what you asked for.

"I bet your dad is so disappointed. Who wants to raise a man who plays with Madrid? Do you always take the easy

like 3 times a month. It’s always the same though, isn’t it. That tinge of shame, then a small outburst. “I’m working

on it dad, and my app is gonna take off”. But there is no app, is there. There’s no hope. Just loneliness."

After that, we get to the DOING THINGS

If you got nothin' that's fine

That one's a bit trcky to quantify

I don't think that one can be done up so neat as the other ones.

"Let's ride."

AH.

Are we ready now?

But I think we need more of a...

"Storm's a-brewin'"

That'll do, yeah.

Whitney wakes up from her night of cider intake with a slight headache and a note

next to her head.

Whitney G. Elieen lets out a great big yawn...and an equally mighty groan as she reaches forward and

takes the note into her hands. Her holy mug sitting right next to her. As full as ever.

On the note is scrawled, "Doc Mitchell's" One of your companions must have left it, or

the Bartender.

Whitney G. Elieen lets the note fall to the floor...

Whitney G. Elieen yawns again before pulling herself up off the bed. How late was it...? She was not used

to sleeping in so late. To say the very least.

Do the Whitney head to Mitchell's place?

Yes. She would shamble her way towards the place.Whitney G. Elieen:

is it the next morning?(From Poage):

Nah, this would be later that same day.

The way is easy enough Whitney. You do not meet too much trouble along the way. There seems to be a tension

in the air though. Not of something waiting to spring, more akin to the quiet after a gunshot. When you make it to

discussion with the woman who was hurt before. Perhaps it would be best not to disturb them.

(She came outside to talk to the horse a bit more)

(my web is down . I'm currently on phone)Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire is outside, curled up, mumbling something to the horse.

Whitney G. Elieen can not help but smile as she makes her approach

The horse knickers softly.

"Hello Crystal...I see you have made a friend."
Said Whitney

Crystal Saint Claire almost shoots Whitney, jumps a solid three feet back, and curls up like a turtle.

The horse is displeased.

Crystal Saint Claire is huddled behind the remains of the cart, peeking out and noticing who it is.

"..."
Said Whitney

"Wh-whitney?"
Said Crystal

"...yes. Yes it is me. I am sorry if I startled you..."
Said Whitney

Crystal Saint Claire runs over and wraps her arms around Whitney's leg, shaking like a leaf.

"he's back..."
Said Crystal

"he's back and he's killing people and he knows where we are i just know it an ah'm scared out've m'mind"

"..."
Said Whitney

Crystal Saint Claire trails off into panicked breaths.

Whitney G. Elieen 's expression turns from one of shock to concern and finally something a little

more...distant. Though that did not tighten her grip on the little one. Not in the slightest.

"Shhh...It is going to be okay..."
Said Whitney

"Be calm Crystal...I am here. Nothing is going to hurt you..."

"...I won't go with him"
Said Crystal

"I will out a bullet in my head before I let him take me"

Crystal Saint Claire takes a deep breath in...

"...there will be no bullets in anyone's heads now...no. He is not here. Not now..."
Said Whitney

"...and by him you refer to...the judge?"

"..."
Said Crystal

"...we...got lucky."

"in a way."

"He was gonna by the time Hauswald and I reached the place."

"And... and inside..."

"...there were bodies."

"Six... And a half."
Said Crystal

"...I can only imagine the cruelty you found..."
Said Whitney

"Perhaps God intended for me to miss this. She has been merciful to me as of late..."

"The last man... He used dynamite."
Said Crystal

"the explosion brought us there."

"we found his journal, and on the last page was the word WHITE. Written in blood. Fresh, still coagulating."

"The lady inside has it. She survived him."

"...I do not trust her."

"The one I healed...?"
Said Whitney

"Doctor Mitchell's patient. Wearing the curious mask."
Said Crystal

"I remember her. The one with the...ruined chest."
Said Whitney

"Considering the pain I felt...it is a small wonder she survived as long as she did. This is who the others are

speaking to right now?"

"What reason have you to not trust her?"

"You suspect foul play in this?"
Said Whitney

"...a thing capable of single-handedly decimating a small fort was unable to kill her? No."

"If he wanted her dead, she would be dead."

"Therefore he wanted her wounded badly enough that she would require a doctor's care, possibly Doctor

"Therefore he wanted her here."

"There fore I do not trust her here."

"...the fruit of paranoia and fear or of observation and truth? I might agree with you on that

point. Either an act of God had saved her, or her being alive is by some dark design."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"God will help us I know. But God also helps those who help themselves. They most of all."

"In light of this, what would you do, Crystal, to prepare for the possibility?"

"I don't know..."
Said Crystal

"It would not be right to force her to leave while she still requires medical attention"

"But it is entirely possible he has infected her with some plague, or planted some unholy progeny within her."

"And what makes you think this my Crystal?"
Said Whitney

"...he uses people."
Said Crystal

"women... Children..."

"people who cannot help themselves."

"That he does...It is within the dark realm of his mind that he can concoct these horrors..."
Said Whitney

"But we must focus on what is in front of us first. What we can know. Maybe the good Doctor has made some

"..."
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen reaches to the side of her pack and produces a mug wrapped tight in cloth.

Crystal Saint Claire holds tight onto Whitney

"For your nerves."
Said She

"Do not drink too much...make not my mistake."

Crystal Saint Claire takes a sip. If it's alcoholic cider, she does a spit-take.

it is indeed alcoholicWhitney G. Elieen:

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire returns the mug.

"It tastes odd."
Said Crystal

"Too much for your liking?"
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen says with a gentle smile as she brings it to her lips for a sip

Crystal Saint Claire nods.

Crystal Saint Claire surgically attaches herself to Whitney's leg using a Hemmlot-Ulman Graft... Or HUG...

Crystal Saint Claire hugs Whitney's leg.

"You are better for my nerves."
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen could not help but smile as she wraps her mug back up. Placing a hand right at the

center of Crystal's back, pushing her that much closer into her tall leg and long, flowing green dress.

"And you, my dear, are a welcome sight to my weary eyes."
Said Whitney

"Like a thousand and one sips of this very mug"

Crystal Saint Claire makes a noise that sounds like a sigh, then takes a deep breath.

"...maybe you can help her... Just... Please. Do not cause yourself irreparable bodily harm."
Said Crystal

"I did it once before have I not?" She says softly. With a smile. "If more is needed I will be

happy to provide it."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"And this time, God willing, I won't almost lose my leg."

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire hugs tighter. She's gotten a little stronger, to the point where you can tell when she's

holding on.

"Crystal...what a grip you have? It seems our mornings together are producing fruit!"
Said Whitney

"I am slightly stronger now! I can do almost fifteen push-ups consistently."
Said Crystal

"That is excellent! I am so proud of you...~"
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen hugs a little tighter!

"Soon you will be as strong as me in no time at all!"
Said Whitney

"...well maybe after a few years." She says with a giggle.

"God and my hormone production willing..."
Said Crystal

"Then you won't have to treat me like a Ming vase!"

"Perhaps not probable, but I... do not hold much, if anything, beneath..."

Crystal Saint Claire takes a deep breath.

For a total of 27~!

I have gotten, and still have from Luck, 2 whites, a red and a blue.

Got one left and it's white.

imma spend a white chip

still nuthin'.

Imma losing this one.

Gonna lose the lowest score fate chip after drawing.

One white

One red

Do we want to wait for Neb and Scootles or...?

Nev can eat a dick, as usual

But Scootles is our backup Buff Chick

not waiting for Nev but waiting for Scots.

Can we get a map and chat while we wait for Scootles?

"...So."
Said Cassie-May

Poage is outside,talking to the horse.

Isn't Yupo viciting SCOOT right now?

"So."
Said Alexander

Sacks whines.

"...Run this by me again, because I ain't sure I understood. What happened?"
Said Cassie-May

Sheila scratches the back of her head with a hand.

"What?"
Said Sheila

"Before or after the graveyard?"
Said Alexander

Poage is outside with Friend Horse.

Sheila lets her hand drop down to hip level and itches the seat of her pants.

"Should be finished in just a minute."
Said Doc

Doc Mitchell walks out into the main room of his surgery shack.

"Both."
Said Cassie-May

"Right. We went to that gravedigger. Turns out he wasn't very good at his job."
Said Alexander

Doc Mitchell sets his medical bag on his desk and begins rolling a set of scalpels up in an oiled cloth.

"Dead dug their way out. One called Cedric was different."
Said Alexander

"Killed them all, he summoned a manitou."

Alexander Hauswald looks away.

"...Manitou told us how to kill the Revenant."
Said Alexander

"...What price?"
Said Cassie-May

"I owe him a favour."
Said Alexander

"...Steep. So, how?"
Said Cassie-May

Fart charps.(To Moondew):

"We need to shoot it in the heart."
Said Alexander

"Was thinking one of us challenges it to a duel and we all just start shooting at it."\

Got them noted(From Moondew):

"Anyway."
Said Alexander

draw fate chops?(From Scotty):

Yes.(To Scotty):

"We come back here, we hear explosion. We head to that confederate warehouse."
Said Alexander

"...Eeeyup, Ah heard that."
Said Cassie-May

"Something killed them all. According to the miss here it's identical to Cedric."
Said Alexander

"Who in tarnation is Cedric, aside from a darn undead?"
Said Cassie-May

"Ah got a new gun."
Said Rockett

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien blinks

"I have no idea."
Said Alexander

"But he almost ate Crystal's feet."
Said Alexander

"...Ah'm now imagining y'al ridin' it like a witch rides a broomstick."
Said Cassie-May

Crystal, the horse knickers and pushes its head at you.

"...Also found three-fifths of a Dead Man's Hand."
Said Alexander

"Jesus Fuck you guys are magnets for bad shit."
Said Sheila

"...Eeeeeyup."
Said Cassie-May

Sheila turns herself slightly, she lets out a hiss of breath as she does.

"Hey Doc?"
Said Sheila

"Yeah?"
Said Doc

"...Thank you... but I don't know about that."
Said Crystal

"Guess we find whatever killed them."
Said Alexander

"And then we wait for the revenant to strike again."

Doc Mitchell finishes putting his medical bag together and closes it up with a thwop of leather.

"It okay for me to hang out with these guys?"
Said Sheila

"Medically safe an' all?"

Doc Mitchell keeps eye contact with Sheila for a few moments. He lets his gaze slide over to Rockett and

her new Gatling, then looks back to Sheila.

"Yeah."
Said Sheila

"...'Ey Rockett? Y'all even know how ta use it, sugercube?"
Said Cassie-May

"She spent a a good minute shooting it."
Said Alexander

"Do you think we'll be able to figure out how to fight him off?"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire hands the horse an apple.

"Whadaya think, hun."
Said Rockett

"Both of mah professions have me dealin' with guns day an' night."

"I hope to high heaven and low hell you haven't seen a bedroom gun with that many barrels."
Said Sheila

"..."
Said Alexander

"Can we get to work."

"Right."
Said Doc

"Ah'm convinced she done see tha' many barrells in bed before, bud."
Said Cassie-May

Doc Mitchell hefts his bag and begins strolling out to his cart.

"Rockett?"
Said Doc

"Guess we oughta go ta th' carnage site an' look fer clues."
Said Cassie-May

"Worked with eight barrels at once before."
Said Rockett

"Mind lending an old friend a hand?"
Said Doc

"Six ain't too hard to manage."
Said Rockett

"What'cha need, Doc?"

"Cart's still turned over."
Said Doc

"Need to right it."

"Right."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob grabs

"Was thinking we could head to the graveyard."
Said Alexander

Rockett Rimjob HEFTS

"Oh, be careful Friend Horse they're moving the cart..."
Said Crystal

"That's it..."
Said Doc

"See if Cedric matches the miss's description."
Said Alexander

Crystal Saint Claire moves slightly away.

Stranth roll.

Rockett Rimjob:

The horse moves away as Rockett hefts the cart.

"Maybe you know better than me what the hell it is, Cassie."
Said Alexander

Not quite Rockett, but close, very close.Wonderful Cowboy Land:00000

"Here."
Said Doc

Doc Mitchell sets down his bag.

"Ain' the office on th' way to the graveyard?"
Said Cassie-May

"Let me help out a lil."
Said Doc

"You sure you ain't gonna throw out yer back?"
Said Rockett

"Not sure."
Said Alexander

"..."
Said Doc

Rockett Rimjob snickers

":Guess we'll be able to check."
Said Alexander

Doc Mitchell puts his gloved hands on the cart and frowns in Rockett's direction.

Roll again.Doc Mitchell:

Rockett Rimjob:

Doc Mitchell:

what a load of dogshitRockett Rimjob:

STRONKDoc Mitchell:

"Y'all totally let him think he done all th' work, eh, Rockett?"
Said Cassie-May

He just flips it one-armedCrystal Saint Claire:

Cassie-May O'Brien leaned on the windowframe with a shit-eating grin.

"Ah think he's jus' tryin' ta impress us."
Said Rockett

"Come on. We're burning daylight."
Said Alexander

Doc Mitchell sucks in a breath and HEAVES. The soles of his boots carve a furrow in the dirt and the

canvas of his gloves strain. The cart moves up slow, but sure, until it is righted.

"..."Alexander Hauswald:00000000

"Don'cha fergit yer new peashooter, Rockett."
Said Cassie-May

Doc Mitchell dusts his hands off and looks to Rockett with a smirk turning the ends of his mustache up.

"What was that about throwing my back out?"
Said Doc

"..."
Said Crystal

Alright, where are you guys heading to?

Glad you could join us, Nev.Cassie-May O'Brien:

Hi Neb.

FAAAATE CHIPS.(To Nevermore):

GET EM WHILE THEY HOT.(To Nevermore):

thanks doc(From Nevermore):

"You sure get inspired when you got a log in yer loins."
Said Rockett

"Ah'll be right back. Gonna grab tha gun."

"So, graveyard or office first?"
Said Cassie-May

Doc Mitchell holds up a hand and opens his mouth in protest, right before Rockett walks past him. He is

still like that when Rockett comes back.

I gottem now take them back(From Nevermore):

"...Let's head to the graveyard first."
Said Alexander

Crystal Saint Claire looks over toward him.

"...Rockett, fer fucks' sake, don't straddle tha' gun."
Said Cassie-May

(Back)Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"C'mere Sunny."
Said Doc

"...do you have any medical textbooks I could purchase?"
Said Crystal

Doc Mitchell takes the horse's bridle and hitches her up to the cart. The horse stamps and knickers a little,

but is otherwise calm.

(...Does the town have a book store?)Alexander Hauswald:

"...I just called her Friend Horse."
Said Crystal

"Sunny is a good name."

(To GM) rolling 1d2Doc Mitchell:

Crystal Saint Claire is standing near the horse with that sort of fascination young girls have for horses in

the west.

There may be a bookstore in town.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano can't tell if here or not

"Thank you kindly little Miss."
Said Doc

No Neb you are not here yet.

okNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Alex will have to take a look eventually. Maybe the owner has a copy of Hoyle's.Alexander Hauswald:

"And no, I keep all my medical know how up here."
Said Doc

Doc Mitchell taps his noggin.

"...Doc."
Said Alexander

"Yep?"
Said Doc

"Are there book stores around?"
Said Alexander

"...can you write down any particularly important advice one would not typically find in a

Crystal Saint Claire:

ActuallyNephi "Longiron" Delano:

"There's a bookstore in town yeah."
Said Doc

Pretty sure you asked ea-Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Excellent. Just curious."
Said Alexander

Well thenNephi "Longiron" Delano:

He asked just generally out of character.Doc Mitchell:

This is him doing it in character.

Which I appreciate.

As this is what interaction is for.

No I mean, he asked it like days ago and you answeredNephi "Longiron" Delano:

I was just trying to remember

He did not.Doc Mitchell:

My bNephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Alright, all of you load up on the cart and we'll head out."
Said Doc

Alexander Hauswald gets up on the cart, carrying Sacks with him.

Doc Mitchell gives Sheila a leg up as she crawls onto the cart.

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire gets onto the cart after a few attempts.

Graveyard, shopping in town, or back to the site of the massacre?

Shopping later. Graveyard now?Alexander Hauswald:

Grrraveyard first, massacre second, shopping third?Cassie-May O'Brien:

anyone has any objections?

NopeCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

I'm good.Alexander Hauswald:

We find Nephi along the road?

Maybe Rockett makes a joke about her big ol' gun?

Nephi has gotten stuck in a mailbox.Crystal Saint Claire:

NoNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Nephi's gotten shoved in a locker

by the town bully

"I didn't know anyone could actually fit in these things" he said about the incident later

what a memeRockett Rimjob:

Nephi is just walking out of the bar when you guys pass through town.

He tried to match Whitney drink for drink last night and nearly developed liver cirrhosis.

...GuysAlexander Hauswald:

Rockett is a big gal, right?Alexander Hauswald:

puts a mask on her

Incoming BaneCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano doesn't drink and therefore has no idea what the sky skull is on about

"Heya fellas!"
Said Nephi

"Where were ya?"
Said Callie

"Life's terrible and we're all gonna die."
Said Nephi

"Nephi. Hop in."
Said Alexander

"Sure thing. Let's mosey... Where to?"
Said Nephi

"Graveyard."
Said Cassie-May

(Get in, nerd!)Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"You're going to see a walkin' dead after it died again."
Said Alexander

"Yer diggin'."
Said Cassie-May

"...Great. Mah favorite."
Said Nephi

"Hope you brought a shovel."
Said Callie

" "Come on down ta the graveyard, Nephi, imma show you somethin real neat"... And

that's when Ishmael showed me a dead body and laughed."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"...She's gonna be a real mean one, that girl."

"Did you make whale jokes at her?"
Said Alexander

"...No? She's mah sister."
Said Nephi

Cassie-May O'Brien kneels down to examine the body

You all make it to the graveyard soon enough. Everything is mostly as you left it.

Alexander Hauswald hops off the wagon, holding Sack.

"...I ended up hanging from the roof last time I tried."
Said Nephi

"By mah ankles."

"Anyway."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano sniffs the air.

"Better'n by yer neck."
Said Callie

(i forgot the dead digger's name)Alexander Hauswald:

It looks like a dried up corpse with a hat Cassie.

"Walkin' Dead, ladies and gentlemen."
Said Alexander

"Always hated them things."
Said Cassie-May

Hamilton Hendricks

"Yer fulla skit, Alex."
Said Nephi

"Dime a dozen if you know where to look."
Said Alexander

"Ain't no such thing."
Said Nephi

Alexander Hauswald walks towatrds Cedric.

"Thissun's diff'rent."
Said Cassie-May

"This, however."
Said Alexander

"Dead don't get back up til god tell'em to."
Said Nephi

"Fellas, say hello to Cedric."
Said Alexander

Doc Mitchell bends down and lifts up a corner of the corpse's lip.

"Howdy Cedric."
Said Cassie-May

"Huh."
Said Doc

Cassie-May O'Brien squats down and examines the corpse.

Rockett Rimjob pokes the corpse with a stick.

"Nephi, the corpses didn't dig themselves out."
Said Alexander

Cassie-May O'Brien scratched her head under the hat and thought long and hard about that.

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers keeps a hand on her revolver. Never can be too sure with corpses

Crystal Saint Claire stays in the cart, but away from mask lady.

"Was smart enough to shoot a rifle, not smart enough to know Crystal's feet taste horrible."
Said Alexander

Doc Mitchell finishes examining the corpse at his feet and walks over to the white one cooking in the sun.

"...Do I even wanna know?"
Said Callie

Shall I roll my Occult?Cassie-May O'Brien:

Yep.Doc Mitchell:

(I'd ask if I should too but I did just say Alex doesn't know what this is)Alexander Hauswald:

Cassie-May O'Brien:+05

"Also, when did we get a gattlin?"
Said Nephi

"...Doc, go get the soldier lady."
Said Alexander

"Tha's Rockett's new gun."
Said Callie

"I need her to tell me if Cedric here matches the description she had."
Said Alexander

"...Ken she even fire it?"
Said Nephi

"Yep."
Said Callie

"...And Nephi?"
Said Alexander

"Yeah?"
Said Nephi

"I'm gonna need your help burying Hamilton here."
Said Alexander

"She shouldn't get down from the cart anytime soon."Doc Mitchell:0

"Man, I didn't sign up for gravediggin..."
Said Nephi

"And I can just bring this thing over to her, if you're keen on her seeing it."
Said Doc

"Neither did I but he helped."
Said Alexander

Cassie, this is a vampire.

"Least we can do is make him rest in peace."
Said Alexander

You can tell because it is white, smells like it was dead for a long ass while, and it has

the pointy ass teeth.

"...Welp, sugercube, tha's a bona fide vampire if Ah ever dun' see un',"
Said Cassie-May

All the dried blood on its lips is a hint too.

"Alright, fine. Yew got a shovel?"
Said Nephi

"...Vampire."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano just LOOKS at Cassie.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano LOOKS.

"......"
Said Crystal

"So, when're we gonna stake the bastard?"
Said Callie

"Nephi if you tell us this isn't a vampire I'll punch you."
Said Alexander

Crystal Saint Claire is suddenly very concerned.

"...I don't think we need to."
Said Alexander

"I shot it dead."

Cassie-May O'Brien pulled out her sabre.

"Maybe I'm the only one here that still gotta sense of reason."
Said Nephi

"Ah sure as fuck ain' content wit' that."
Said Cassie-May

"Y'all taken complete leave a'yer senses?"
Said Nephi

"Fair enough."
Said Alexander

Crystal Saint Claire makes a note to research the spread of vampirism.

(wait fuck)Alexander Hauswald:

"You saw me pull bullets out of thin air."

"Listen t'yerselves."
Said Nephi

Cassie-May O'Brien grabs the sabre with both hands and decapitates the vampire.

"You think these corpses were dug out?"
Said Alexander

Roll strength.

qwqCassie-May O'Brien:

Do eet.

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Vampires, walkin dead, and necromancers. All in the first week!"
Said Nephi

lol

"Bleh."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald points at a shovel.

"Get to work, kid."
Said Alexander

"The world makes sense, Alex. It ain't some dime novel where anythin can happen."
Said Nephi

"Yew'd sure fuckin' think tha'."
Said Cassie-May

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers goes over to the wheelbarrow and tries to break off a piece of a handle to use

as a stake

Cassie-May O'Brien shook her hand to take care of the tingling.

"...Kid. Kid, you're working with a woman who uses MIRACLES."
Said Alexander

Cedric bit Crystal.(From Crystal Saint Claire):

"Miracles been happenin for 2000 years."
Said Nephi

Cassie swings the saber down. It gets about a tenth of the way through the thing's

neck. Blood burbles out around the blade. It is dark and sludgelike, either from being dead or being a vampire,

hard to tell.

"You're working with a man who uses magic-"
Said Alexander

Should I be concerned?(From Crystal Saint Claire):

"...Cass. Why can't we just burn it?"
Said Alexander

Maybe.(To Crystal Saint Claire):

"Yew got anythin flammable?"
Said Cassie-May

"When the heck did the world get so weird? Wasn't two years ago, it was all bank

robbers and th'occasional dragon out in the Maze."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"...Fair point."Alexander Hauswald:0

Cassie-May O'Brien puts her foot on the corpse and starts sawing with grunts and groans.

"I got matches. Anyone got any whiskey?"
Said Callie

>whiskey

Like you'd waste good whiskey on this.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Rockett Rimjob holds out her hand to Cass.

"Lemme try.Rockett Rimjob:

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Don't gotta be good stuff. Rotgut's flammableCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

Cassie-May O'Brien grumbles and lets Rockett try.

Rockett Rimjob grabs the sabre.

"...these things are neat."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob proceeds to swing it and try to finish what Cass started.

"Nice chance equalizers, them sure are."
Said Cassie-May

"....So, nobody gonna help me bury Hamilton?"
Said Alexander

Crystal Saint Claire pulls a sharpened pencil and a knife from her bag.

Crystal Saint Claire walks over and hands it Hauswald the pencil.

"Y'all check Hamilton fer bite marks first."
Said Cassie-May

"Bite... marks?"
Said Crystal

"Nah, I know what killed him."
Said Alexander

"We watched him die. It was the manitou."
Said Crystal

"T'wasn't this."
Said Alexander

"Vampire bite marks, eey-oh."
Said Cassie-May

"...Marks?"
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald looks at Crystal.

Crystal Saint Claire looks to Cassie.

"...why... does that matter?"
Said Crystal

"Y'all never dun' read any dime novels? Them vampires make new vampires from their

victims. Suckin' their blood out harder than Rockett 'ere sucks cocks,"

Cassie-May O'Brien:

(Bram Stoker didn't write Dracula yet.)Alexander Hauswald:

...It was after 1870?Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

(This is 1870, right?)Alexander Hauswald:

(when'd Dracula came out?)Cassie-May O'Brien:

When Rockett swings the sabre, the head comes off like a pat of butter coming off the

(Damn.)Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

(...huh. My bad.)Cassie-May O'Brien:

Also, something to note

Vampires were common knowledge before that.

"...Ah loosened it up fer yew, Rockett."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Rockett

"Sure did."

Bram Stoker just codified and popularized the image of them.

"..."
Said Alexander

Dracula made vampires COOL.Crystal Saint Claire:

"Sure did."
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimjob holds it back out to Cass.

Like DnD made goblins cool.Crystal Saint Claire:

Lots of townsfolk staked shit and burned bodies before that.

And a whole host of different things.

"...So."
Said Alexander

No.

Alex Jones made goblins cool.

actually it was lord Byron's friend, a doctor named... Polidori, I think? made the first vampire novel.

The Vampyre.

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers keeps trying to break off part of the wheelbarrow handle to use as a stake

I thought Tolkein made goblins cool.Alexander Hauswald:

Cassie-May O'Brien held her hand out to Rockett for her sabre.

Rockett Rimjob gives it back

Alexander Hauswald hands Rockett the pencil Crystal gave him.

Rockett Rimjob takes the pencil, confused.

doc whyRockett Rimjob:

"Stab him with it and SOMEONE HELP ME BURY THE DEAD MAN."
Said Alexander

What?

"...Uh."
Said Rockett

I didn't do anything.

"'Kay."
Said Rockett

Nephi "Longiron" Delano grabs the shovel

Alexander Hauswald tries to lift the dead man.

Rockett Rimjob stabs

WHISKEY(From Rockett Rimjob):

something-Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

what was that

"...Y'all wanna stake someone, y'alll stake Hamilton."
Said Cassie-May

Must be hearing things Nev.

Cassie-May O'Brien kicks the head away.

"...Cassie. I saw him die."
Said Alexander

there it was againNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Sounds like someone asking for whiskey

I'm hearing a voiceCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"Got nothing to do with the campires."
Said Alexander

"..Ah sure heard somethin' now."
Said Cassie-May

"...You hear that?"
Said Nephi

(heard that too.)Alexander Hauswald:

Cassie-May O'Brien looks around.

"Sounded like someone asking for whiskey."
Said Nephi

"...whiskey, whiskey?"
Said Cassie-May

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers tries to break off the handle harder now.

"..."
Said Alexander

Rockett Rimjob stabs the corpse again with the pen.

Strength roll?Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

Alexander Hauswald leans close to Hamilton and listens.

Rockett Rimjob stabs one more time, then, confused, gives the pen back to Hauswald.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano sighs

"Can we just get done here and go on with our lives?"
Said Nephi

Strength roll yes Callie.

Rolling StrengthCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

"Do I roll strength to lift Hamilton too?Alexander Hauswald:

It takes some doing, but you manage to snap it off.

BBRBRockett Rimjob:

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers looks at her "stake". "Not pretty, but it'll do."

ShhCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

Makeshift stake is best stake

Sacks sees stick.

Sacks barks. Gib Stick.

"Naw, this ain't fer playin. It's fer stakin' vamps."
Said Callie

Sacks wants the stick.

Gib Stick.Sacks:

Cassie-May O'Brien kicks Cecil's head away from the body.

whateverCassie-May O'Brien:

Corpse-dickCallie "Law-Dog" Mathers:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has just been digging another grave while out here

"Miss O'Brien..."Crystal Saint Claire:0

"Eeeyup?"
Said Cassie-May

GIB STICK.Sacks:

"Do you recall any protocol for treatment of a vampire's bite?"
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien scratched her head.

"...Vampire nearly killed her."
Said Alexander

Cassie-May O'Brien:02

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers shakes her head. "Yer not gettin' it."

I HAVE THE POOOOOOWEEEEERRRR

That enough, GM?Cassie-May O'Brien:

To know?

Can I roll strength to put Hamilton in a grave?Alexander Hauswald:

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers kneels down and lines up her stake with Hamilton's heart and then stakes him

very little about what to do if you are bit.

If the vampire wants you to be a vampire, they gotta drain you of blood and you have to be a virgin.

Most of the time.

"...Show me where y'all done git bit."
Said Cassie-May

But.

"The wounds were healed..."
Said Crystal

It is still getting bit by a corpse.

"...Whitney?"
Said Cassie-May

"Whitney. It still hurt, though..."
Said Crystal

Most texts mention that if you do get bit, you should get it treated by a sawbones.

"...I did not enjoy the sensation of having my throat punctured in such manner..."
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien pat-patted Crystal's cheek.

"Yer probably gonna be fahne. But if Ah were you, Ah'd go an' fuck someone. Ah'm pretty

sure y'all gotta be a virgin ta git turned."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"That... Sounds kinda silly."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano rolls his eyes

"...It's Magic, Nephi."
Said Alexander

"It makes sense when you look into it."

"Whole load of hogwash."
Said Nephi

(...Rockett becomes a vampire hunter)Alexander Hauswald:

(yes)Rockett Rimjob:

"Anyway."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald tries to lift Hamilton. Roll strength?

'"...Or wuz it tha' if yer not a virgin when yer turned, yer cooch grows teeth? Ah can't

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Ah'm sure Ah done hear at least one story like tha'."

"...'Bout a vampire hooker wit' fangs in her cunt."

"Load. Of. Hogwash."
Said Nephi

"With how many folks that like ta get bitey, Ah can conclusively say that probly ain't tha case."
Said Rockett

You can lift him pretty well Alex, though touching him feels a little...off.

"...Strange."
Said Alexander

"Eh"
Said Cassie-May

Alexander Hauswald tries to understand why.

"Whuzzit?"
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Crystal

Sacks sniffs Hamilton.

Roll occult.

"That is worrisome."
Said Crystal

Alexander Hauswald:+02+05+0204

wowNephi "Longiron" Delano:0

"Something feels off about Hamilton here."
Said Alexander

Holy shit that's some trash roll bruh.

just spend a chip dudeCassie-May O'Brien:

He made it.

Can I whitechip this?Alexander Hauswald:

ohCassie-May O'Brien:

But, that's some trash rolls.

OhAlexander Hauswald:

Must be some real easy information.

You recall from when you were studying with your mentor Alex. When two

practitioners touch each other there is sometimes a...feeling, that passes between them. The severity and type

depends on each individual's magic.

Hamilton must still have some lingering in him.

"..."
Said Alexander

"There's still some magic left in him."

DID SOMEONE SAY CORPSE BATTERY?

"There's a little magic in all of us, Alex. Don't make him any less dead."
Said Nephi

Alexander Hauswald lays him down again, holding his hand against Ham's head.

"No, like. He should've been empty by now."
Said Alexander

Cassie-May O'Brien looks over curiously.

Alexander Hauswald tries to dig in a little deeper.

"...Huckster stuff, you can call it."
Said Alexander

Sacks tries to get Callie's stick.

Are you trying to dig into his skull?

some magic in him.

Alexander Hauswald:

You can tell that it originates from his head.

And that it isn't going away.

"...Something in his head."
Said Alexander

Doc Mitchell taps Alex on the shoulder.

"...I'm going to ask something and I want all of you to promise-"
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald looks at the doc.

"Need me to perform an autopsy?"
Said Doc

"...Yes. Yes please."
Said Alexander

Rockett Rimjob steps out of the way

Then clear out of the way."Doc Mitchell:

Alexander Hauswald moves aside.

"Please."
Said Doc

Alexander Hauswald was totally not going to break open his skull.

Cassie-May O'Brien crosses her arms and watches.

Doc Mitchell sets his medical bag on the ground and bends to look at Hamilton.

"I have some things if you need to get into the bone"
Said Crystal

Doc Mitchell fishes around in his bag for a moment before drawing out a scalpel. It glints in the light.

(To GM) rolling 4d10kh1!!

Doc Mitchell:+02+0105

Doc Mitchell makes a cut around Hamilton's head at about the level of his eyebrows. Once he completes

that cut, he makes four more. Each of the four cuts starts at the outside of the circular cut and ends at the

top of Hamilton's head. Mitchell puts his scalpel away in his bag. He turns back to the corpse, places a

hand on the top of its head, and peels down the skin.

GUYSNephi "Longiron" Delano:

I GOTTA GO

IT'S SNOWING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 20 YEARS

"...Well, that's something new."
Said Doc

"What is it?"
Said Alexander

(I'll be right back)Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

...oh right. one second.Crystal Saint Claire:

Doc Mitchell scrubs off some of the blood on the skull and turns Hamilton's head so Hauswald can see.

Across the top of the skull is a five pointed star.0

Huh. Snow out here too.Crystal Saint Claire:

"Why the hell's that there?"
Said Doc

"...May Ah see?"
Said Cassie-May

"...Guessin' that's where the magic came from."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald examines said star intently.

Roll medicine.

Vet counts?Alexander Hauswald:

Can I roll, too?Crystal Saint Claire:

You can all roll if you want.

Vet does not count for this one, no.

Crystal Saint Claire:

Well I don't got medicine.Alexander Hauswald:

Roll the associated stat at a penalty.

Cassie-May O'Brien:+0503

What's my penalty?Alexander Hauswald:

Five.

Crystal Saint Claire:+013+09+08+02

( + )-5

Oh fuckin' kay then.

I diagnosed the fucking shit out of thatAlexander Hauswald:

Jaysis.

Dr. HausAlexander Hauswald:

wowCassie-May O'Brien:

jeezRockett Rimjob:

burning does not appear to have caused any trauma to the flesh, only to the bone, as there is no scar tissue from

a previous incision. The sigil was somehow burnt into the skull without damaging anything else, which should be

physically impossible.

"...Someone burnt this onto the skull."
Said Alexander

"But wouldn't that show on the skin?"
Said Callie

"That's the thing."
Said Alexander

"...How the...?Cassie-May O'Brien:

"There's no sign of anything."
Said Alexander

"...Fucking magic."
Said Callie

Alexander Hauswald tries to see if the magic comes from the star itself or not.

You can tell, it is coming from the star.

You do not touch it while ascertaining this.

"...So, do we break that star with a rock, or...?"
Said Cassie-May

"...I'm going to do something stupid and touch the star."
Said Alexander

"Hauswald don't die."
Said Rockett

"If anything happens, that hand's comin' off."
Said Callie

Alexander Hauswald takes a deep breath and touches the star.

Everything stops.

None of you can perceive the stopping, save for Hauswald.

But Hauswald can only watch.

And listen.

"... And a telegraph wasn't quick enough?"
Said Alexander

"A telegraph doesn't have enough style."???:

"And it lacks the personal touch."

"...Right."
Said Alexander

"So. Two things."

"What do I call you? 'Demon' isn't cutting it."

"And two, what's the favor?"

"You can call me..."???:

"...Horn works."
Said Alexander

"And the favor is to head to a town in Wyoming called Felding."
Said Horn

"You'll get the rest of your instructions when you get there."

"Head there soon."

"Or there might be..."

Horn examines his gloved hand, splaying the fingers out and listening to the leather creak.

"Regrettable consequences."
Said Horn

"I'll take care of it when I finish here. I got a vampire and a revenant."
Said Alexander

"I'll deal with them and head over."

"Soon as you leave this town, I want you headed out to Wyoming."
Said Horn

Horn pats Alex on the back.

I'm backNephi "Longiron" Delano:

"See you later."
Said Horn

"...Alright, Horn."
Said Alexander

Horn raises a hand and snaps his fingers.

Time resumes.

The horse appears to be unsettled.

Alexander Hauswald pulls away from the skull, gasping.

"Wha'?"
Said Callie

"...Did it burn yew or sumthin'?"
Said Cassie-May

"...No. Had a visit from that manitou."
Said Alexander

"When we're done here, he wants me to go to Felding, Wyoming."

Do i know that place by any chance(From Rockett Rimjob):

"...Wyomin?"
Said Nephi

Roll me a d20.(To Scotty):

"Wyoming."
Said Alexander

"That's indian country, innit?"
Said Nephi

"Aw hell, tha's Union territory. Don't think they'll take too kindly ta me up there."

Doc Mitchell struggles a little as he walks back over to the cart. He lets the body flop off him and back

onto the ground once he gets there.

"Fuck you, Alex, Ah ain' leavin' a friend alone."

"Yeah. If I don;t come along, y'all are gonna see..."

Doc Mitchell hops back up onto the cart and grabs Sunny's reins.

"All aboard."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano clambers his way on

Said Alexander

"Let's look at the massacre a little better."

Crystal Saint Claire eventually climbs up.

Mitchell drives the cart out close to the old Marshalry office and stops when Sunny

begins to spook.

"S'alright girl."
Said Doc

"Shield yer eyes, ye with little guts."
Said Rockett

"S'a goddamn bloodbath..."
Said Callie

"...Yep."
Said Alexander

The bodies are as you left them, but dried and beginning to stink. Flies orbit the

corpses like planets around a sun.

"Eugh."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien goes to examine the corpses.

"...Aw, shoot. Ah liked this un'."
Said Cassie-May

The one in the entryway was a young Confederate soldier. Now he is two halves of a

young Confederate soldier.

Crystal Saint Claire throws up again.

"MOTHERFUCKER."
Said Sheila

Cassie-May O'Brien examines the blood trail.

"...He crawled, or got dragged?"
Said Cassie-May

(If anything, it might hit the wheel.)Crystal Saint Claire:

Sheila throws the coat away and holds Crystal's hair for her.

"Don't worry. She ain't gonna have much ta throw up in about two seconds."
Said Rockett

"Ah hope."

Rockett Rimjob grabs the two halves of this one.

"Think he crawled, try an' get somethin' solid behind him as a defense maybe?"
Said Callie

"...uh."

The Major appears to have nothing on him, save for his clothes, the slag of a pistol, and the

dynamite in his right hand.

bits scooped inside.

Cassie, you find nothing of any interest other than the dynamite and the pistol slag.

"...He blew himself up."

The paper appears to be an official military form of the Confederacy.

Rockett Rimjob hauls the gore bag to the cart.

"Or... something like that."

Rockett Rimjob grabs the last gun with her bloody hands.

Rockett Rimjob yanks it off its stand

Doc Mitchell jams two fingers into a hole in the cadaver before him. He wiggles them around for a second

or two before drawing back a small piece of lead.

The gun comes off with a loud SKRRRRRANK, Rockett.

she can fit on the cart.

Said Cassie-May

"...They were a disbanded regiment an' failed ta follow direct orders? The hell?"

Rockett manages to get the gun and four ammo boxes onto the cart before the wheels

start to protest.

"How many, Cassie?"
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has finished being sick."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano wipes his mouth with a hanky... Then promptly disposes of it.

Sheila says nothing for about a minute.

"Ah ain't gotta stand here while yew all are makin fun of me."

Sheila puts a hand on the carbine laid across her lap.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano stomps off in a huff.

"I think."
Said Alexander

"How do you know about that?"
Said Sheila

Nephi "Longiron" Delano hops into the cart with Crystal.

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers hands over the papers Alex gave her

"More like we didn't agree too well with the new chain of command."
Said Sheila

"And we did some things to demonstrate 'at."

"Things what got the new honcho angrier'n a yellow jacket nest.

"A vampire went through and killed all your buddies."

"How do we get it back here and kill it?"

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers thinks for a second, then lies, keeping up the Major's story. "Orders from higher

Rockett makes her way to the outskirts of town in a horse drawn carriage with Dobray.

The interior of the carriage is more spacious than most, but feels as small as all the rest due to the pile of Russian

meat sitting across from her.

"Miss Natasha iz excite to see you."
Said Dobray

"Everything oiled down."

"'Cludin' her, Ah hope."
Said Rockett

"Da."
Said Dobray

"Should be arrive in second or three."

"Perfect."
Said Rockett

Dobray turns and knocks on the wall of the carriage between himself and the driver. He lets loose a string

of Russian syllables and waits a moment. He gets a short word in reply and smiles.

"We here?"
Said Rockett

Dobray boots open the door of the carriage.

"Da."
Said Dobray

"Miz Natasha shud be vaiting for you."

"Next to beeg ship."

"Hard to mees."

A massive...thing descends from the sky with more grace than it seems it should

"Maybe Ah should get mahself inta this railroadin' business..."

Rockett Rimjob contemplates this for a moment.

Natasha Minayeva :

Natasha Minayeva grabs her head

Natasha Minayeva kisses both her cheeks before planting a smooch on her lips.

"Good of you to join this evening!"
Said Natasha

Rockett Rimjob giggles quietly as she's greeted, giving Natasha a peck on the cheek in return.

"Good ta be here! How ya been, sweetie~?"
Said Rockett

"I have been good. Every day is good~ Tonight will be even better with you here~"
Said Natasha

"Tell me. You ever flown before?"

"Can't say Ah have."

"Am Ah about to..~?"

"I would not show you White Dragon without offering you to ride her. That is what a bitch

would do and contrary to popular opinion? I am not bitch!"

Natasha Minayeva :

Dobray smiles at Natasha's words and bends down so she can kiss him on the head. He pulls her into a

short hug, and then reverts swiftly back to professionalism.

Natasha Minayeva gives him a firm pat on the back before pulling away. Grinning wildly. "Join us my

friend. I have dinner waiting on the ship."

"Aww, you got me somethin' cookin'?"
Said Rockett

"Ain't that real nice."

Rockett Rimjob smiles a bit.

"Take it yer gonna milk this night fer all it's worth, ain't ya?"

ship proper. "Everyone on this ship has my trust and approval. In fact I was going to ask about that..."

Natasha Minayeva :

"How do you feel about multiple partners?"

"Costs extra,"
Said she

"Somethin' tells me though you ain't gonna have nooooo trouble."

"Do you approve though? Is this something you want to do?"
Said Natasha

"Tha more tha merrier, sweetheart~"
Said Rockett

"I am capable of a great many things. Some may consider uncomfortable...but know that I

will never, ever do anything that you do not approve of."

Natasha Minayeva :

"That is what separates the likes of me from the likes of Rickter or Benjamin." She says, smiling as she leads you

up the steps. "And I am glad you approve~"

"There is Dobray. The pilot. My four gunmen and my bomb technician. Myself included."

Dobray is reticent as Natasha talks about how she's going to have Rockett. There might even be a bit of

blush underneath his eight o clock shadow.

"Ah see. Skeleton crew? Or... are there a few more'n that on board tha airboat?"
Said Rockett

"There is always more. But none that are with us tonight. I did not intend for you to fuck an

entire garrison."

Natasha Minayeva :

"Though if you wish of this you may do so on our own time. My employees would enjoy the distraction."

"Well."
Said Rockett

"Ain't never had a problem clearin' out taverns one-bah-one before."

"Maybe. Depends on how much you wear me out."

" There is plenty to go around I promise you. I would be worried if you were a lesser

... also my phone keyboard hates me

Let's see here.000000000000

Alex excuses himself from the company of his friends and treks to town alone. He

looks over the facade of the square for a particular type of shop. He has no concrete idea of what it looks like, only

a feeling. He soon spots a place that matches that feeling. A shop sign with no filligree, in muted colors and

flowing script that reads, "Gohvis Books."

"...Seems like the right place. Wait here, Sacks."
Said Alexander

"[Buy me a book, okay? I'm behind on my reading.]"
Said Sacks

"[I'll see if they stock Dickens."
Said Alexander

"[Thanks, boss.]"
Said Sacks

Alexander Hauswald walks inside, looking around.

The door creaks a bit as you enter. Warm air envelops Hauswald with a gentle,

beguiling embrace. The smell of the musty pages comes next. It tickles the nose with the promise of knowledge,

old and refined, like wine. There is a small sitting area, and a desk beyond that, and the bookshelves, the many

bookshelves. There is a man at the desk, bent over a tome with delicate tools in his thin hands.

Alexander Hauswald ltakes silent steps as if to not interrupt. "... excuse me."

Gohvis does not look up from his work. He finishes applying something from a pot sitting next to his

elbow into the book and settling a page into place. Then, he raises his aquiline features to Alex.

"Will you be needing, assistance?"
Said Gohvis

"I think I will.Alexander Hauswald:

"Mmmm."
Said Gohvis

I'm looking for a... Specific book. The newer editions are butchered beyond relief."Alexander Hauswald:

Gohvis sets his tools down and covers the pot with his lid.

"I'm sure..."
Said Gohvis

Gohvis rises from his chair and dusts off the legs of his corduroy trousers.

Alexander Hauswald shrugs. "You probably heard people talk about it before. Hoyle's Book of Games?"

"Of course."
Said Gohvis

"Which edition, would you like?"

Gohvis clasps his hands behind himself and peers down at Alex through his half moon spectacles.

"The earlier the better. If I didn't know better I'd ask for first or second but those are

collector's items nowadays."

Alexander Hauswald:

"Mmmmm."
Said Gohvis

Gohvis strolls over to a shelf behind Alex and pulls a black hardback down.

Gohvis flips it open.

Gohvis shuts it back.

Gohvis walks back over to Alex.

Alexander Hauswald lifts a brow at Gohvis.

"Sir?"
Said Gohvis

"Yes?"
Said Alexander

"You appear, to be curious about something."
Said Gohvis

"The fact you stock it is one."
Said Alexander

"At least, you USED to stock it."

"This place stocks many books."
Said Gohvis

"It is not altogether improbable for you to find the one you are looking for."

"That costs extra."

"Right. How expensive are we talking?"
Said Alexander

"What do you have to pay with?"
Said Gohvis

"Money. Guns."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald fishes one of the unidentified coins.

"These, if they mean anything to you."
Said Alexander

(back inna tick)Gohvis:

Gohvis stretches one hand forward and plucks the coin out of Alex's hand. He turns it over a few times,

squinting and widening his eyes to get a good look at it. His other hand drifts to his mouth and taps at his

"Interesting, yes..."
Said Gohvis

"I could get a lot of books with this."

Gohvis looks Alex in the eyes.

"Do you have any more?"
Said Gohvis

UrbanCritter reaches to his pocket and pulls the rest.

(Need to reselect Alex)Gohvis:

(woop)Alexander Hauswald:

"This."
Said Gohvis

Gohvis twiddles the coin in his hand.

"Is a gold doubloon covered in sea muck."
Said Gohvis

"It appears to be Spanish."

"...Well now."
Said Alexander

"Said friend is a lot richer than I thought."

"I think it's safe to say two of these are worth a book?"

"Yes, that one."
Said Gohvis

"I do have another one."

"... Another Book of Games?"
Said Alexander

"Yes."
Said Gohvis

"And others besides."

"...Do tell, then. What else you got that can interest me?"
Said Alexander

"What, are you interests?"
Said Gohvis

"Well, I study... Well, occult things, let's say."
Said Alexander

"That is a broad range."
Said Gohvis

"What occult things?"

"I also have a friend that would be interested in a Charles Dickens book but that's not very

Alexander Hauswald:

"Indeed, he was a good writer."
Said Gohvis

'The Hunting Ground' magic rituals and such. Things about monsters, too."

Alexander Hauswald:

"May his spirit rest in peace."
Said Gohvis

"Their culture is...not easy to win trust with."

"And they pass along most of their information through oral tradition."

""So I heard. Do you have anything at all about magic? Maybe from the European side?"
Said Alexander

"Indeed."
Said Gohvis

"What would you like to know about?"

"Mostly about the stuff that requires me to speak to demons, for example. The things Faust

was inspired by."

Alexander Hauswald:

Gohvis takes out a pad and pencil from a sweater pocket.

Gohvis scribbles down a few things.

Gohvis turns the pad to Hauswald.

Alexander Hauswald examined it.

"Unabridged copy of Faust, Demonology for Beginners, and The Crossroads."
Said Gohvis

"I can also recommend a Dickens for your friend."

"These all look like a good start, sir. What can you recommend in that regard?"
Said Alexander

Gohvis flips the pad closed, tucks it into the pocket if came from, and begins walking along the shelves.

He picks out four books and brings them back to his desk.

Gohvis slides the tome he was working on to the side and pulls a thick metal box out of a large desk

Alexander Hauswald uses the opportunity to close his eyes and focus, trying to see if he can feel a whiff

of the arcane around here.

You can't smell the arcane, but you can feel it. A low hum at first that gets louder in

your mind the more you focus on it. You can almo-

Gohvis snaps his fingers, bringing you back to reality.

"None of that."
Said Gohvis

Alexander Hauswald snaps back to reality.

"I beg your pardon?"
Said Alexander

"Have you ever head, of privacy?"
Said Gohvis

"Heard about it. Didn't think you'd notice. Or know."
Said Alexander

Gohvis throws a glare of utter contempt at Alex.

"Mister Hauswald."
Said Gohvis

"I live in a bookshop."

"I am selling you books that instruct how to cheat magic from the supernatural world."

"Not every storeowner in New York is a Huckster, Mr. Gohvis."
Said Alexander

"Did it occur to you, that I might have read some of them."
Said Gohvis

"Or you will quickly run up a tab."

"Of course, sir."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald has the barest hint of a grin.

Gohvis turns up the intensity of his glare a notch. One thing hand stretches out and his fingers snap

again. Alex's shoes slide forward and stop right in front of Gohvis' desk.

"Seven."
Said Gohvis

"...Seven dubloons?"
Said Alexander

"Seven ears of corn."
Said Gohvis

"Of course seven doubloons."

"Can we settle on five?"
Said Alexander

Gohvis slides three books off the pile.

"Yes."
Said Gohvis

"...Fair enough."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald rolls his eyes and slides seven dubloons over.

Gohvis sets the other books back, takes the coins from Alex, and slides the books over to him.

"A pleasure."
Said Gohvis

Alexander Hauswald examines the book, starting with the book of Games.

On the front is the title of the book. Underneath that, is a large four.

All in silver lettering on jet black cover.

"...Fourth Edition, huh?"
Said Alexander

"Yes."
Said Gohvis

"...Fairly recent. We're, what, fifth, sixth edition nowadays?"
Said Alexander

"Yes."
Said Gohvis

I hear they're working on a seventh already."

chunk of the important stuff."

Alexander Hauswald:

"I know."
Said Gohvis

"It is the best you are currently getting."

"...Hm.Alexander Hauswald:

Do tell me if you ever get an earlier one, then."

"I will endeavor to inform you."
Said Gohvis

"This'll do fine for the moment."
Said Alexander

"Excellent."
Said Gohvis

Alexander Hauswald collects the books and nods at Gohvis.

"... Actually..."
Said Alexander

Gohvis inclines his head a degree to Alex.

"I want to ask about something else. Less related to books."
Said Alexander

"I"m looking for my brother. A bit taller than me, darker hair. Last time I saw him he was clean shaven."

"Forcall I know he was taken to the west against his will by a..."

Alexander Hauswald tries to remember who exactly took him. Something about a pale man?

Pale man, bullets don't do much to him, and appears to have a penchant for causing

trouble wherever he is seen. Including your former beat.

"Pale man. Trouble all around him, bullets didn't do much. You seen someone like that,

heard anything?"

Alexander Hauswald:

"I have heard certain rumors about that individual, or one that matches that description."
Said Gohvis

"Rumor though."

"Any bit helps."
Said Alexander

"Unsubstantiated and difficult to verify."
Said Gohvis

"Several of them do have an interesting common tidbit though."

"Do tell, Mr. Gohvis."
Said Alexander

"Well, since you've patronized my shop so thoroughly, I will."
Said Gohvis

"Relation to the 'Indian' tribes."

"Many of the stories involve people getting warning from those people."

"Either directly, or indirectly."

"...What a coincidence. I'm headed to Wyoming soon."
Said Alexander

"Keep an ear and eye open."
Said Gohvis

"Information like that is valuable."

"I'd certainly want it."

"Will do, Mr. Gohvis. Thank you and have a good day."
Said Alexander

"You as well, Mister Hauswald."
Said Gohvis

"Do come again."

"I definitely will."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald nods and walks out, picking the Dickens book and giving it a quick look before

handing it to Sacks.

"[Oh boy oh boy.]"
Said Sacks

Sacks holds it with his mouth. Gently.

Sacks has gained 1 copy of Barnaby Rudge.

Think this is enough for now?

That's up to you.

Is there anything else you want to do?

Nah. I 4hink we can wrap this up here.Sacks:

"Hope anythin real bad just passes em by."

"Frontier folk tend to be wary."

"You can loosen anyone up with enough drinks though."

"Not my specialty."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano turns pointedly towards Rockett.

"Same reason ah don't touch the stuff, god's word notwithstandin'."
Said Nephi

"You don't need liquor to keep yer mouth a-runnin', sweetie."
Said Rockett

"Might need something hard to shut him up."
Said Sheila

Sheila drums her fingers against the slab behind her for a moment before quirking her head at Nephi.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano just looks confused

"I'm implying you might need a fat cock down your throat before you stop talking sweetie."
Said Sheila

There is a horse outside Nephi.

It looks at you with its horse eyes and its long equine face.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads over and pets the horse

"You won't judge me or curse like a sailor, will ya, old girl?"
Said Nephi

"God'll judge them. Oh yes he will..."

The horse does not appear to understand what you are saying, or the horse does not

care. She does nicker softly as you pet her though.

Rockett Rimjob looks down at Cass.

Cassie-May O'Brien puckers up, tiptoes, and places a big wet kiss on Rockett's cheek.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano groans

Rockett Rimjob chuckles a little, then pulls a 10 dollar bill out of her billfold.

"Here ya go, sweetcheeks."
Said Rockett

"Easiest ten bucks Ah ever made."

The old bird looks up to you with wide green eyes and a face like a prune left out in

the sun too long.

"Looking...rough is not a crime."

"Could you, walk with me for a bit though?"

"I seem to have...lost my way to the butcher's."

Rockett Rimjob kicks open the doors to the saloon and saunters

Nephi "Longiron" Delano follows in behind

"Callie, Nephi, y'all wanna drink?"
Said Cassie-May

You see the bartender at his post. The townsfolk you saw earlier are around a table

playing cards, save one that is drinking alone.

"Ah ain't gonna turn one down."
Said Callie

"Anythin' specific?"
Said Cassie-May

"Not really."
Said Callie

"After you, Cassie."
Said Rockett

"Howdy, pardner. Yew got real petey?"
Said Cassie-May

Bartender takes a mug off the counter and crouches down under the bar for a moment. A fizzling sound

burbles out from under the counter. The barman sets a fresh mug of dark ale down in front of Cassie a

second later.

Rockett Rimjob looks at the mug.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano sits at a table by himself.

"...pff."
Said Rockett

"Ah think there's been a misunnerstandin'."

"...Ah remember yew sayin' tha's a scotch, sugercube."
Said Cassie-May

"You get Scotch."
Said Bartender

"When you show me you can afford Scotch."

"Yeah. Cass here's lookin' ta get me some scotch."
Said Rockett

"Believe it 'r not, she's takin' up after me. Did some tutorin' earlier. Turns out she ain't half bad."

"Made ten bucks off 'er first customer."

"..."
Said Cassie-May

"Mmmm."
Said Bartender

Rockett Rimjob just looks at Cass with a sly grin

Cassie-May O'Brien pulled out a ten dollar bill from her bra and gave the bartender a deadpan stare.

Rockett Rimjob starts -giggling-

Bartender pulls a dark bottle down and sets a short glass in front of Cassie.

Bartender takes the ten.

Bartender sets down a second bottle, much like the first.

"Tha's bettur. An' a milk in th' cleanest glass yew got ta th' beanpole boy sittin' alone at th'

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Bartender nods.

"Put a cherry garnish on it, too."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien gave Rockett's ankle a light kick and leaned in.

Rockett Rimjob quirks a brow at Cass.

Cassie-May O'Brien whispered.

Rockett Rimjob nods once.

Cassie-May O'Brien pulled back and smirked.

"Ah'll just take a beer."
Said Callie

"Yer gonna make us down these two bottles ourselves?"
Said Rockett

"Come on, Cal."

Bartender pulls another glass out. This one taller and wider than the shot glass. He opens the icebox,

pours something white out of a bottle into it, and takes it over to Nephi.

"...Oh, they're making fun of me again, aren't they?"
Said Nephi

Bartender sets the glass down in front of him.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano sighs, not about to complain.

Rockett Rimjob looks over her shoulder and stares at Nephi with a... curious expression.

Cassie-May O'Brien ignored the shot glass and just took a swig from the bottle.

Rockett Rimjob waits until he takes a sip.

Bartender takes a bottle of maraschino cherries out of his apron.

"Dunno."
Said Bartender

Bartender sets one down on the rim of Nephi's milk.

"...Well, ah guess it ain't all bad."
Said Nephi

"Jesus traveled with the sinners, not the saints, after all."

"Died next to them too."
Said Bartender

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks back at Rockett as he picks up the drink, holds it up, then takes a sip.

Bartender walks back behind the bar.

"Yep."
Said Nephi

Bartender slides the ale over to Callie.

Rockett Rimjob subtly reaches in her dress and adjusts her bra as she sees Nephi take a sip. She was

almost nippin' in plain daylight.

Rockett Rimjob turns back to the bar.

"..."
Said Nephi

"...She couldn't have."

"Dollar and fifty cent ma'am."
Said Bartender

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks back at it.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks back to rockett

"...fer milk an' a cherry?"
Said Rockett

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks back to the drink

Cassie-May O'Brien looked over at Nephi with a wide grin and raised her own whiskey bottle in a toast.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano mimicks Cassie's motion.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano does so quite reluctantly.

"Milk, cherry, and vodka."
Said Bartender

Cassie-May O'Brien sips her drink, maintaining eye contact.

"Ain't got no straight milk left."
Said Bartender

"Oh boy. That poor boy's in fer a surprise, ain't he."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob digs out two dollars and gives it to the bartender.

Bartender takes the bills and tucks them into his apron.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano continues to lightly sip, quirking an eyebrow.

"Weird cows they got around here..."
Said Nephi

Callie "Law-Dog" Mathers stifles a giggle

"...Welp, now th' bluff's got real."
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimjob snickers quietly to herself.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano continues to almost enjoy his "drink"

"Wit' how much yew drink, Rockett, yer own titmilk woulda be boozed up fer sure."
Said Cassie-May

"Ain't they supposed to have that Andrew fella in here?"
Said Marbh

"Probly."

"...Somethin's real off bout this."

"Probly tastes like tobacco, too, 'round this time'a year."

"Guess it's probably just nearin the throw-out day."

"Don't know...heard from the other boys while I was out cuttin' he's a strange fella."

"..Dunnaw, Rockett. Ah woulda have ta try mahself."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano proceeds to eavesdrop.

"Wears a...thing like them Indians right?"

Denard takes a long sip from his coffee stained mug.

Rockett Rimjob lightly elbows Cass.

"Yers'd probly give me tha jitters, all that coffee ya drink."

"Nah, supposed to be...more. Look like actual bird."
Said Denard

"Must be one of them fuckin' wonky Northerners."

Said Gnawly

"Mn?"
Said Cassie-May

"Ah've seen you guzzle that shit."
Said Rockett

"Put mah habits ta shame."

Rockett Rimjob opens her bottle and takes a sip.

"Careful."
Said Bartender

"Want to pace yourself with a drink like that."

"..."
Said Rockett

"Yew know, sugercube. Coffee means Ah gotta sleep less."
Said Cassie-May

'Ah could drink anyone in this bar unner tha table. Ah know mah own pace."Rockett Rimjob:

Rockett Rimjob lifts the bottle to her lips and takes a couple indignant gulps.

"Can you now?"
Said Bartender

"Tha's fuckin' Rockett Rimjob. 'Course she can."
Said Cassie-May

"I know Marbh over there is pure blood Irish."
Said Bartender

"Fucker pisses better whiskey than they have in most bars up North."

"Looks tha part."
Said Rockett

"Think you can get him?"
Said Bartender

"If ya give 'em five shots ta catch up."
Said Rockett

"Mmm."
Said Bartender

"HEY MARBH."

Marbh Teine slams his tankard against the table.

"WOT?"
Said Marbh

Rockett has not had five shots. She has had three and wants an edge.(From Rockett Rimjob):

"LADY OVER HERE SAYS SHE CAN OUTDRINK YER."
Said Bartender

"FUCK OFF."
Said Marbh

"SHE'LL PONY UP FOR IT IF YOU WIN."
Said Bartender

Cassie-May O'Brien glugs another sip of her whiskey down.

Marbh Teine slides his chair back and waltzes over.

Marbh Teine throws his an arm over Rockett's shoulder.

"Ayyy lass."
Said Marbh

"Yew got noice knockers."

"Ay think them, and you, is fulla hot ayr though."

"'Fraid not, beardboy. Ires got nothin' on me."
Said Rockett

"I'm not draggin' him home."
Said Beaumont

Bartender pulls two bottles down and pushes them toward Teine. He pulls another one down and pushes

it to Rockett.

"Five, Marbh."
Said Bartender

Rockett Rimjob takes her bottle.

"Aye, Aye, kayp yer panties pressed."
Said Marbh

Marbh Teine takes one bottle, pops the top off, and swigs. His adam's apple bobs five times. The red

haired man sets the bottle down.

"Alright."
Said Marbh

"Less go."

"You got five in ya?"
Said Rockett

"Course I do."
Said Marbh

"Mebbe a bit more."

"Figured you could use a bit o' help."

Rockett Rimjob rolls her eyes. "Ah ain't tha one that's gonna be needin' help after this..."

Rockett Rimjob looks at the Bartender.

"Yer tha ref here."
Said Rockett

Bartender nods.

"Get started."
Said Bartender

"Shot each."

Vigor check for both.

I don't know deadlands wellRockett Rimjob:

Both of them take the first shot smooth as butter.

"Next round."

Rockett Rimjob grabs her shot.

Rockett Rimjob:+03+0104

Just wait.Bartender:

I'll roll all ones for you.

( + )-3

Neither one appears to be getting too far ahead, though Marbh didn't cough after he took his shot.

"Looks like one of you is going to be paying for a couple bottles."

"Keep going."

Rockett Rimjob knocks it back

Rockett Rimjob blinks a few times.

The Irishman looks fine though.Bartender:

"...'nother."
Said Rockett

"S'like water."
Said Marbh

Rockett Rimjob holds her hand out to the bartender, staring at the Irishman as she does.

Cassie-May O'Brien takes a sip herself at her own slow, steady pace/

Bartender places a shot into Rockett's hand.

Bartender slides one over to Marbh a moment later.

Rockett Rimjob shucks it straight down her hatch.

Rockett Rimjob:+01+0202

this is getting WORSE

Bartender slides two more shots to the participants.

Rockett Rimjob swipes it and slams it.

Rockett Rimjob:+03+0506

"Ooooo, you got a little fire in ya."

Marbh Teine sucks his down.

Marbh Teine:+03+04040000

Rockett Rimjob hiccups.

Bartender sets a bucket on the counter.

"If you need to chuck."
Said Bartender

Bartender slides tow more shots over the bartop.

"Ah don' need'a chuck!"
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob yells, taking the shot and knocking it back.

Rockett Rimjob:+06+0506

"...Welp then."
Said Cassie-May

Marbh Teine:+03+0601

Cassie-May O'Brien glugged her own whiskey.

Cassie-May O'Brien:01

"Come on."
Said Bartender

"One of you needs to win."

"I'm not made of whiskey."

Bartender pours another two shots.

Rockett Rimjob buuuurps.

"Hey. Yew two."
Said Cassie-May

"THAS ME."
Said Marbh

Rockett Rimjob wipes her mouth.

"AH'M MADE A WHISKEY."Marbh Teine:000

"Winner gits a flash of mah tits."
Said Cassie-May

"It ain't gonna be YEW!"
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob looks at Cass.

Rockett Rimjob goes deadpan.

Rockett Rimjob takes the shot

Rockett Rimjob:+03+0907

Cassie-May O'Brien waggles eyebrows.

"Them tittays is mine."
Said Marbh

Marbh Teine slugs it.

Marbh Teine:+03+0206

Marbh Teine face falls onto the bar for a second. He's not looking too hot.

Cassie-May O'Brien snickers.

"Knew thut's gunna motivate yew."
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimjob swallows hard.

Cassie-May O'Brien popped the top button off.

Rockett Rimjob leeeeans back a little, but steadies herself.

"...y'gunna... faceplant, bucko?"
Said Rockett

Bartender sighs and pours the next two shots.

"Pizz off."
Said Marbh

Rockett Rimjob takes it, almost spilling it in her haste, and then swallows it down.

( )-3

Marbh Teine:+01+04+04

Marbh Teine is barely keeping himself upright.

Rockett Rimjob is blushing, swoozy, and having trouble focusing.

"Ayl getcha."
Said Marbh

Rockett Rimjob hiccups.

"Come on Marbh."
Said Bartender

"You can do better than this."

Bartender produces two more shots. These may be the last.

"Shet up."
Said Marbh

Cassie-May O'Brien grabs the bucket, spins in her seat, and places it between her legs in Marbh's

Rockett Rimjob grabs it, stares at it with crossed eyes for a moment, and then pours it down her throat.

Rockett Rimjob:+06+0506

I think she just got more soberCassie-May O'Brien:

Marbh Teine:+05+02+04

Marbh Teine pitches over and hits the floor with a resounding FHWOOMP.

"..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob raises her fists into the air in victory!

"AH WIII--"
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien returns the bucket to the bartender.

"Me azz iz grazz an' fans pans...."
Said Marbh

Rockett Rimjob bends over and wretches onto the bucket.

Bartender holds Rockett's hair back.

Cassie-May O'Brien patpats Rocket's back.

Cassie-May O'Brien glugs another shot of her own whiskey... should I roll, GM?

Rockett Rimjob hurls a couple more times. It reeks of stomach acid and cheap whiskey.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is feeling a little ill himself now.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has finished his drink and is feeling oddly woozy.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano attempts to stand up and head over towards poor Rockett.

Rockett Rimjob finishes up, wiping her mouth and coughing once or twice.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano wobbles for a second then straightens.

"Whoa."
Said Nephi

"Sh'weird stuff, that was."

"Yew won, Rockett."
Said Cassie-May

Go ahead and roll CassieBartender:

Cassie-May O'Brien:+03

Nephi "Longiron" Delano wobblesteps his way over to the others.

"...ooohf..."
Said Rockett

You feel a little buzz, but nothing you can't handle.Bartender:

"Who won?"
Said Nephi

"There, there, sugercube. Rockett sure did win."
Said Cassie-May

"...whooth' fuck d'ya think..?"
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob looks proud. She also looks like she's had a stroke.

Rockett Rimjob burps. It smells awful, Cass.

Cassie-May O'Brien wrinkles her nose.

Gnawly Garret picks Marbh up by the neck of his shirt.

"...Real lady."
Said Cassie-May

"...sorry."
Said Rockett

"Fergiven."
Said Cassie-May

"You still alive?"
Said Gnawly

Rockett Rimjob hiccups loudly.

Marbh Teine moans a pitiful, drunkard's moan.

"Yep."
Said Gnawly

"Bartender, y'all got sumthin' ta make coffee in?"
Said Cassie-May

Gnawly Garret tosses the semi-conscious Marbh over his shoulder and walks out of the bar.

"Let's get you home."
Said Gnawly

Rockett Rimjob stands up off her stool, trips a bit, and slumps onto Cass.

"I can make some coffee, if that's what you mean."
Said Bartender

"Whoa!"
Said Cassie-May

"Nah. Ah got mah own coffee."

Cassie-May O'Brien patpats Rockett

"...sssssoo, how's abooout... yew help me get back... ta mah room..?"
Said Rockett

"We... Urf. We gotcha rockett."
Said Nephi

"Yooou maaade a proooomiiiiiise, Cass..!"
Said Rockett

"Let's just get her back. Had en... Oof. Enough fun for one night."
Said Nephi

"Ah sure did, sugercube. Ah sure did. Cummawn."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien chuckled, taking the rest of her bottle.

Cassie-May O'Brien:

Everyone roll Nimbleness to remain upright and get Rockett to her room. -4 for Rockett and Nephi. -1

for Cassie.

Cassie-May O'Brien stood up and tried to lead the drunk woman out.

Rockett Rimjob:+03+0401

( + )-4

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:+01+0201

Cassie-May O'Brien:+02

The three of you make it to the stairs, but find them a bit difficult.Bartender:

It is a miss Cassie.

( )+3

Nephi is...well he's not great, but he does help Cassie drag Rockett up the stairs and over to the room.

He stops once they get to the top and wanders away. Cassie and Rockett pile into a room above the saloon

"Yew sure yew dun' wanna wait wit' yer reward until yew can see straight again, Rockett?"

Be right backBartender:0000

Rockett Rimjob stumbles a bit, but manages to grab Cass' shoulder.

Rockett Rimjob then proceeds to shove her face in Cass' bosom. Nephi could likely hear a very loud

motorboating as he walks away.

"..."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Nephi

"Why. Why do ah travel with these people."

"...Ah said flash, not a feel, ye perv."
Said Cassie-May

"brbrbrrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrb"
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien did literally nothing to move away or stop her, though.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano groans and goes off to go find Whitney to get away from the ludicrous amounts

of PURE SIN coming from that room

Rockett Rimjob stops after a short moment.

Rockett Rimjob pulls back. She tries to flash Cass a grin, but it's drunken and disfigured. She them

hobbles over to the bed, faceplants, and sprawls out.

"...Cassie-May O'Brien:

Cassie-May O'Brien just covers her mouth with her hand and starts chortling, tipsy herself.

"Yer incorrigible."
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimjob grumbles something. Her words are muffled by bedsheets, though.

Rockett Rimjob does not move otherwise

Cassie-May O'Brien puts her bottle away and puts one knee on the bed, leaning down to Rockett.

"Whut wuzzat?"
Said Cassie-May

"...smgrbngh,coffh..."
Said Rockett

"...Coffee...?"
Said Cassie-May

"...Strong coffee?"

"..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob nods.

Hot coffee~Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"...Sure do, sugercube. Y'all wait here."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien wobbled back downstairs and asked the bartender to give her access to coffeemaking

You got some.

PURE SIN

Tenting your pants.

Something something I'll be in my bunkNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Gonna go now, peace out

Bai buckaroo

Cassie-May O'Brien uses up like half a pound of her coffee to make two mugs of tarlike substance that is

to coffe like rectified spirit is to beer

Cassie-May O'Brien goes back upstairs and offers Rockett one

The air molecules distort around the steam from this brew.

What hath the percolator wrought?

CoffeeCassie-May O'Brien:

Rockett Rimjob grabs it

Rockett Rimjob almost spills it in her drunkenness

Rockett Rimjob sipps

...

Rockett Rimjob blinks.

Roll Nimbleness.

Rockett Rimjob:

Rockett spills a little bit of the coffee, it lands on the side of the bed. Some of the

sheet melts.

"..."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien sipped from her mug of eldritch coffee.

"Coffee. Strong."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob sips again.0000

Your mind is addled with booze and coffee. Hands grow jittery and restless. Toes curl and uncurl of their own will.

Eyes widen. Teeth go on edge. You're going to have to burn off some of this excess energy.

(To Scotty):

"Ain' it great?"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien glug glugs

Rockett Rimjob vibrates.

Rockett Rimjob physically shakes.

Rockett Rimjob twitches her leg.

Cassie-May O'Brien is down half her mug already

"...Y'alright there?"
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimjob looks at the nightstand.

Rockett Rimjob reaches out with a shaky hand and sets the cup down

Rockett Rimjob lies back down on her back.

Cassie-May O'Brien sits down next to her

Cassie-May O'Brien reaches out

Cassie-May O'Brien rufffles up her hair

"...whahy'dye puttin' that drink..?"
Said Rockett

"Coffee. Water."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob twitches and shakes all over

Rockett Rimjob tries to tuck herself in with her fumbly, twitching, drunken hands

"Oh shush. Lemme."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien tucks her in

"Want a lullaby?"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien smirked.

"..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob jitters a bit more.

"..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob hiccups.

"...mmmaayb' should... pass out... annan..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob twitches.

Rockett Rimjob seems to be confused, alarmed, and drunk.

"Shh, shh..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien strokes through Rockett

Rockett's hair*Cassie-May O'Brien:

Rockett Rimjob calms down a bit, but is still twitchy.

"...Eh, fuck it. Why nawt."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien continued to pet Rockett and cleared her throat, then started singing a nice lullaby.

Cassie-May O'Brien:+04+0605

Performin' (Singing)

Rockett Rimjob calms down. A little. There's not much that can be done about the caffiene in her system,

but she tries to relax.

Rockett Rimjob closes her eyes

Rockett Rimjob looks pale.

"...Darn, Ah didn' sing in a while."
Said Cassie-May

"...Y'all awkay, Eockett?"

"...Ah think... mah heart's gonna explode..."
Said Rockett

"Ah can hear it beatin'..."

Rockett Rimjob is breathing at a disquieting pace for someone who's lying on their back.

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien checked Rockett pulse on the neck

thumpadumpadumpadumpadumpRockett Rimjob:

Heart's beating like a rabbit's.

"Deep breaths, sugercube."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien stroked her cheek with a thumb.

Rockett Rimjob breathes heavily

Rockett Rimjob slooowly starts to calm down.

"Therrre we go."
Said Cassie-May

"Y'all gunna be alright?"0

Rockett Rimjob pauses for a bit, then nods a couple of times.

"Want meh ta stay?"
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimjob looks up at Cass.

Rockett Rimjob nodnods.

"Awkay, yew big cute idjit."
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimjob shivers a bit more, and nestles herself in the covers.

Cassie-May O'Brien finishes her coffee, puts the mug on the table, slips her boots off and flops on the bed

next to Rockett.

Rockett Rimjob jitters and shakes all the while, trying her damnedest to calm down.

"...So. Did yew like 'em?"
Said Cassie-May

"...h-huh..?"
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob is confused, and a little too concentrated on trying to keep her heart from stopping.

"Mah tits. Yes sure done a lot ta see 'em."
Said Cassie-May

"...smelled nice. Felt nice. Soft. ...n-not sure Ah'd wanna... coffee from 'em, but..."
Said Rockett

"Hyuk. Cummawn, jus' cuddle up."
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimjob reaches out for Cass. She's uncoordinated, but succeeds in giving her a hug, at least.

Rockett Rimjob squeezes. She's also shaking in her boots, which are still on.

"...Want meh ta git yer boots off?"
Said Cassie-May

"...please."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien untangled herself from the hug and pulled Rockett's covers away, so she could get to

her boots. Soon enough, the boots joined Cassie's own on the floor.

Rockett Rimjob mutters some sort of thanks. It's hardly audible or intelligible.

Rockett Rimjob muffles a burp with her hand.

Cassie-May O'Brien tucks the covers over herself and Rockett, snuggled up to her.

"There we go."
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimjob nods once. "...uh-huh."

"...'zit hot in here...?"
Said Rockett

"Yer act'alleh hot, or jus' lookin' fer an excuse ta git our clothes off?"
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Rockett

"...tha first one."

"...Well, sugercube, shucks, whut can Ah say. Yew sure are one hot gal."
Said Cassie-May

"...takes one ta know one..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob calms down a bit, but still has an awfully fast heartbeat. Cass could feel it against her own

"...an' Ah... don' mean ta ruin tha mood, but... ffhgh, Ah don' feel so good..."
Said Rockett

"Ah ain' surprised. Can Ah help?"
Said Cassie-May

"...jus' stay there, it'll... wear off... Ah think..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob gives ACass a squeeze.

"Mmmhm. Ah'm 'ere fer yew, sugercube. Naw worries."
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimjob closes her eyes and tries her damnedest to sleep. Her heart gradually starts to calm the

fuck down.

And I think that's the cut because it's like 4:23 AM hereCassie-May O'Brien:

go sleepRockett Rimjob:

I need to get the pellet stove working again

this was funCassie-May O'Brien:

this was funRockett Rimjob:

Cassie-May O'Brien:

So cute.

What is it that you need me for?

Gotta throw a bunch of stuff off a map.

Alex has been up tonight trying to drown the memory of his brother and the chalk

skinned man who took him in a bottle of whiskey. He has made it through one and is starting in on a second when

the Bartender leans in and taps the table in front of the former lawman.

"We got talking to do."
Said Bartender

UrbanCritter looks up from his glass, lifting a brow.

"What about?"

Alexander Hauswald squints, trying to see if this is the Bartender or Horn's poker buddy he's talking to.

"Favors owed."
Said Bartender

Bartender pulls a cloth out of his apron. It smells like beer. He holds it out to Alex.

"...Ah."
Said Alexander

"Clean up a little, you're a mess."
Said Bartender

Alexander Hauswald wipes his face, trying to go from 'drunk' to 'capable'.

As Alex wipes the cloth across his face, he senses a change in the atmosphere of the

"I'm saying what I already said. I'll head to Wyoming when I'm done here-"
Said Alexander

Horn lays both hands flat on the bartop and looks over Alex with his sunken sockets.

"I'm here to give you some detail."
Said Horn

"What, being cryptic got tiring?"
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald sets his glass aside.

"No, there have been developments."
Said Horn

"I need to keep you abreast."

"Since we're business partners, and you will be representing me."

"Fair enough. Go ahead."
Said Alexander

Sacks is wondering where his boss is.

Sacks, you are outside. You are tied to a post. You have a bone. The bone is good.

You also have your copy of Barnaby Rudge.

"... Eloquently named. What's his name?"
Said Alexander

"He's old, he's Indian, and he could tear your throat out at a moment's notice."
Said Horn

"His name is Lyoop."

"Be polite."

"...Right. an old Indian called Lyoop. What's the occasion?"
Said Alexander

"You need him to find a man."
Said Horn

"A man with a red right hand."

"... I'm going to need a little more detail, Horn."
Said Alexander

"That's all the detail I can give you at the moment, other then what you need to do when you find my man."
Said Horn

"What do I need to do, then?"
Said Alexander

"You need..."
Said Horn

Horn leans a little further over the counter of the bar, pushing a few mugs out of the way.

"To shake his red, right hand."
Said Horn

"Do not let anything stop you from doing this."

"...Shake his hand and bring him to Lyoop."
Said Alexander

"Yes."
Said Horn

"Lyoop will have more for you when you get to him."

"He has to abide by fewer, restrictions."

"Strange rituals you're concocting."
Said Alexander

"Still. I do this and we're even. Correct?"

"You do this, and all debts are paid."
Said Horn

"Mine to you."

"And yours to me."

"...Except one."
Said Alexander

"I know."
Said Horn

"This is the way to him."

"m.."
Said Alexander

Horn takes his hands off the top of the bar and steps back. He holds both of them out to his side open

"What?"
Said Horn

"Don't you trust me?"

Alexander Hauswald 's grip around the glass tightened.

"I'm worried, Horn.Alexander Hauswald:

"I know you hold your deals."

"It doesn't mean I'm any less worried."

"Good."
Said Horn

"That means you're not an idiot."

"But I want you to know something."
Said Alexander

"If I end up being swindled. If I find my brother with a bullet in his head..."

Alexander Hauswald takes a long sip from his glass.

"Not even hell would keep me from getting justice."
Said Alexander

"Good boast."
Said Horn

"If you haven't got anything else to intimidate me with, I'll be going."

"I've got other business needs seeing to."

"Much more pleasurable business."

"I believe that'll be all, yes."
Said Alexander

"Bye Hauswald, enjoy your drink."
Said Horn

Alexander Hauswald looks at him coldly, and closes his eyes, rubbing his temples.

Horn takes a bottle of whiskey out from under the bar and pushes it over to Alex.

Alexander Hauswald examines it when he opens his eyes.

Horn holds out his hand.

Alexander Hauswald looks at it suspiciously. Before shaking.

"..."
Said Bartender

"I want my rag back."

"What- oh. Sorry. Dozed off."
Said Alexander

"No problem."
Said Bartender

"Happens all the time."

Alexander Hauswald hands him his rag back, trying to pretend he didn't just shake the man's hand.

Bartender takes the stained piece of cloth and tucks it back into his apron.

"So. You said something or was it just the booze playing with my mind?"
Said Alexander

"Just telling you to make sure you don't out drink your own wallet."
Said Bartender

"Oh. I think I'll be fine."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald idly examines the bottle Horn pulled out, before setting his glass.

"...I think I'll be done after this glass."
Said Alexander

"Alright."
Said Bartender

"Tab is five dollars."

"((Horn's bottle is just whiskey, then?))Alexander Hauswald:

Alexander Hauswald slides a fiver on the counter, finishing his glass.

"Have a good evening, sir."
Said Alexander

Roll Cognition.Bartender:

"You too."

((on mobile. Remind me what to roll?))Alexander Hauswald:

Alexander Hauswald:+03+03+03

The label says that it is a simple bottle of whiskey from a local distillery. Popping the

cap off and smelling the liquid inside tells you that is not the case. Smells older, more distinguished. It's probably

"..."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald stashes the bottle. He'll have to get Cassie to take a better look.

((I guess we can end here, for now?))Alexander Hauswald:

I dunno

All black :c

I didn't know we're that deep South

Why does Rockett get top billing0

Or rather, the biggest name by a country mile

Sacks gets a billing when he earns it.

Hai

can i have my chips from last time please

be part of this one.

Have at the chips while I rev up the story.

... White white red white

Yes.

All of you get your chips.

K

Five points for Sneak 3

dimVitrarius spent literally all of hs points so far on new Aptitudes

dimVitrarius one of them is singing

All things considered, I should have saved my points or cashed in another red so I could go to Shootin 7

poke me on Discord if anything

Looks like no Rockett and no Whitney today.

...so hey yall

fun fact

We can't have more than ten chips at a time, according to the manual

It has been an interesting time, but as of today it is time to do as sages past have said

time after time, get the hell out of Dodge. Normally, for the distance you folks need to travel, it would take a train

ride and a full set of horses. It is a good thing you are travelling with Rockett and her magical, mystical cooter. She

banged her way into getting passage for the lot of you on an expensive airship captained by one of the railroad

baronesses. You think it is a Miss Natasha, but everyone on the airship besides you guys speaks with a gratuitous

Russian accent that it renders their speech near incomprehensible. The important part is that the ship gets you

folks where you're going. It touches down just outside of Moose, Wyoming. Whitney, Crystal, the tiny bandit boy,

fuck the railroad baroness, respectively. The rest of you head out into the forest as Alex tries to explain what little

he knows about the current mission from hell.

"Finally. Weather that doesn't make ya feel like yer boilin in yer own skin."
Said Nephi

"..."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald just looks grimly into the horizon.

"...Yew've been real quiet the whole trip, Alex."
Said Nephi

"...Care ta fill the rest of us in on what's goin on?"

"...More spooky stuff."
Said Alexander

"Horn talked to me before we left."

(Varmus are you back?)

The four of you emerge into a clearing. There's a burble of water nearby.

"...An' whut 'e wants?"
Said Cassie-May

"He told me who we're supposed to meet."
Said Alexander

I only see white screen with Alex's tokenCassie-May O'Brien:

I assume it's still loading then.

"There's an old Indian called Lyoop. He's our contact here, and he's not bound by Manitou

bullshit so he'll be more talkative."

Alexander Hauswald:

Or I moved you too close to an edge or something.

imma refreshCassie-May O'Brien:

"...M'gonna take your word for it. You're our resident expert on demons."
Said Nephi

"He also wants me to shake hands with a man with a red hand."
Said Alexander

"Hang on."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald pulls out the Brandy-in-whiskey-bottle out of his packs.

Alexander Hauswald hands it to Cassie.

"He also gave me this."
Said Alexander

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien does not take it

(You guys got full control and can see)

Cassie-May O'Brien leaned on the rock

"It's... alcohol. I think. Was hoping you'd know more."
Said Alexander

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien takes the bottle

Cassie-May O'Brien examines

Roooool scrutinizing or Cognition at a penalty.

Rold Gold.

Cassie-May O'Brien:+05+0107

It says on the outside that it is a whiskey produced by the Doge Distillery Est. 1832.

Opening the bottle and taking a sniff determines that to be a lie. The booze inside whiffs of expense and age.

Probably brandy, you'd have to taste it to be sure.

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien took a swig and rolled the liquid in her mouth, but didn't swallow

Nephi "Longiron" Delano goes around the other side of the rock.0

"We're real close to Indian territory now, aren't we?"
Said Nephi

Yep, Brandy with an undercurrent that you can't identify offhand...

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is mostly looking at the ground and his gun.

(To GM) rolling 1d10

Nephi "Longiron" Delano slowly inches forward, making sure there aren't any traps or foot snares or

anything in front of him.

Cassie-May O'Brien spits the liquid out on the ground

Nephi, a rock sails right past your head.

"!"
Said Nephi

"...Brandy. Weird one."
Said Cassie-May

Nephi "Longiron" Delano jumps up and starts waving his rifle around in confusion

(Always Sunny card: "Nephi gets caught in a trap")Alexander Hauswald:

"...Must be gene-"

Alexander Hauswald saw Nephi and the rock.

Cassie-May O'Brien closes the bottle back and hides it in one of her pockets

"...Oh boy."
Said Alexander

"Who's there? Show yerself!"
Said Nephi

"Can't help that you be blind, boy."
Said Drawls

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks across the little river.

Lyoop is perched on a rock, barefoot. The Indian has a small stack of stones next to him.

Alexander Hauswald takes a step closer.

"...Welp. Howdy."
Said Cassie-May

((Can I gift-o-gab him?))Alexander Hauswald:

Wossat do.Lyoop:

Gift of Gab lets me speak any language I heard before.Alexander Hauswald:

He's speaking english.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

He is speaking fine, if badly accented and odd sounding, English.Lyoop:0

"...Lyoop?"
Said Alexander

"Horn sent me."

Lyoop picks up a stone with his right hand and tosses it up in the air a few times.

"Mmmm..."
Said Lyoop

Lyoop skips it across the river. It lands somewhere around Alex's feet.

"You look it."
Said Lyoop

Alexander Hauswald tries to not flinch.

"I look like I make bad decisions?"
Said Alexander

"Hey there, compadre."
Said Nephi

"Eeeeyup."
Said Cassie-May

"And he's right, Alex."
Said Nephi

"You do."

"The beard, for instance."

"Fair enough."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald looks at Nephi.

Lyoop says nothing in response to Alex or Nephi. He does pick up another stone.

"Grow one of your own and then talk to me about beards."
Said Alexander

Cassie-May O'Brien put her thumbs in her pockets.

"Going to sit on other side of river?"
Said Lyoop

"Don't think I can."
Said Nephi

"Are yew gunna throw them stones at us th' moment we try ta go over tha' log over there?"
Said Cassie-May

"Will you stop throwing rocks at us so we can pass?"
Said Alexander

"Da couldn't. Not fer lack of tryin."
Said Nephi

"Afraid of stones?"
Said Lyoop

"Ain't afraid of nothin."
Said Nephi

"..."
Said Cassie-May

"No, but I am afraid of getting brained."
Said Alexander

"Bad liar."
Said Lyoop

Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads over to the big log over the stream."

"Ain't lyin."
Said Nephi

He lyin.

"Ah swear, Alex, pushin' tha' boy's button's easier than pissin' sittin'."
Said Cassie-May

Alexander Hauswald snickers.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano hops up on top of the log and walks over.

"It's a good pasttime."
Said Alexander

"You both are TERRIBLE friends."
Said Nephi

Lyoop skips the stone in his hand downstream. It bounces on the water five times, then blips down under

the current.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano does a little spin as he jumps back on the ground.

Sacks sniffs everything. He was a city dog. Trees smell funny.

Lyoop tosses a stone underhanded. It lands on top of Nephi's hat.

(be back inna tick)Lyoop:

"...So, Lyoop."
Said Alexander

"Nice eye."
Said Cassie-May

"...Ey!"
Said Nephi

Alexander Hauswald sits down beside the tree-bridge.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano reaches up and fishes the rock out of his hat.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano leans against a nearby tree.

Cassie-May O'Brien just stands on the log's end.

"...Welp?"
Said Cassie-May

"If someone can fill us all in on the situation;, it;d be mighty appreciated."
Said Nephi

"Alex here ain't exactly been sharin much."

"Horn talked to me before we got here. He wanted me to talk to Lyoop and bring him a red-

handed man.

Alexander Hauswald:

He also said Lyoop will be more talkative."

"Th'blazes that supposed ta mean?"
Said Nephi

"He meant it literally, I think."
Said Alexander

"He also wanted me to shake that hand."

"Well then. We found Lyoop. Now all we need's a red-handed man."
Said Nephi

"You find him in the forgotten places."
Said Lyoop

"Place got no glory or power left in it."

"Y;all can git more cryptic?"
Said Cassie-May

"Ya."
Said Lyoop

"...See, I was hoping for real answers."
Said Alexander

"Horn said you're following less rules."

"I'm gonna take you there myself."
Said Lyoop

"Sounds good to me."
Said Nephi

"Whut's the catch?"
Said Cassie-May

Nephi "Longiron" Delano stretches.

"No catch."
Said Lyoop

"I'm payin debt, same as you."

"...What he got you for?"
Said Alexander

"Alreadeh makes me nawt trust yew none."
Said Cassie-May

"Ain't somethin' he got me for."
Said Lyoop

"What choice do we have, Cassie?"
Said Nephi

"Somethin' I got him boss for."
Said Lyoop

I should probabyl add myself [Intolerant:Indians] Flaw(From Cassie-May O'Brien):

"...Right."
Said Alexander

Intolerant INJUNS.(To dimVitrarius):

"Let's do this already."
Said Alexander

"Welp, we can jus' turn an' walk away Ah guess?"
Said Cassie-May

Nephi "Longiron" Delano spins his rifle in his hands and whistles.

"No more questions?"
Said Lyoop

"No we can't."
Said Alexander

Lyoop looks to Cassie.

"You, can."
Said Lyoop

Lyoop points to Alex.

"He, no can do."
Said Lyoop

"I'm stickin with Alex."
Said Nephi

"You wanna go back to the others, that's fine."

"...That's sweet, Nephi."
Said Alexander

"I ain't abandonin a friend in need."
Said Nephi

"...Not again."

"...Ah sure ain' either."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien cracked her knuckles

"...Thanks, guys."
Said Alexander

"Sacks says thanks too."

"Besides. I'm sure you both would do the same fer me if it were my brother in trouble."
Said Nephi

"Cheer up, fellas!"

"We're on an adventure!"

Nephi "Longiron" Delano throws both hands into the air, laughs, and takes a step towards Lyoop.

"You're on an adventure. I'm paying a debt."
Said Alexander

"Doesn't mean you can't have a good time."
Said Nephi

"Ma always used to say there was no such thing as adventure."

"We just got problems, conundrums, fightin, pain, and sex."

"It's when we survive and tell it to someone else that it becomes an adventure, right?"

"...Sex? Ain'cha mormon?"
Said Cassie-May

"Cassie."
Said Nephi

"We have lots of sex."

"Just between couples."

"How d'ya think I got seven siblings?"

"So no sex for Nephi."
Said Alexander

"Oy!"
Said Nephi

"...Gewd un'."
Said Cassie-May

"Yew know whut's th' diff'rence between Nephi an' eggs?"

"Eggs get laid?"
Said Alexander

"...???"
Said Nephi

other people. You can't remember right now. Point is, Alex and Cassie and Nephi left to go and do something. You

aren't missin' out on it, and you especially ain't missin' out on teasing Nephi.

(To Scotty):

"Eeeeeeyup."
Said Cassie-May

"...Whot..."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano quietly fumes.

Cassie-May O'Brien grinned at Nephi.

"Ah can get a girl if I wanna."
Said Nephi

Sacks makes a noise. You think it's laughter.

"Prove it."
Said Cassie-May

"All I'd have to do is head back home, serve a mission."
Said Nephi

"Ladies are all over returned missionaries."

I'm on mobile, gimme a bit(From Scotty):

"You took a look at Rockett and fainted."
Said Alexander

"...Once!"
Said Nephi

O key.(To Scotty):

"..."
Said Cassie-May

"And that was more than a look, she was drapin herself all over me!"
Said Nephi

". . ."
Said Cassie-May

"Ain't proper is what it is!"
Said Nephi

"She could probably make you faint again."
Said Alexander

Cassie-May O'Brien hooked her arm around Nephi's neck and bumped his hip with hers.

"Don't think that boy ever seen a titty not on a cow."
Said Lyoop

"Whut 'bout meh~?"
Said Cassie-May

"Is everyone we meet gonna be on the devilish side of pleasures of the flesh?"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano huffs again, louder this time.

"Sure do, yer mom's right. All sex on them adventures."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Nephi

"...Come on. Let's go before Nephi faints."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks at Cassie for a long second. His face is, as ever, as readable as a book.

"Ah don' think Ah got boobs big enuff' fer tha'."
Said Cassie-May

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is not thinking church-approved thoughts, at least for a second.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano shakes his head.

"C'mon let's get goin."
Said Nephi

Cassie-May O'Brien bounced her small chest with her other hand.

"Defineteleh smaller than Rockett, eh?"
Said Cassie-May

"A-ah wouldn't kno."
Said Nephi

"...Not like I was measuring."

"Yer got them eyes."
Said Cassie-May

Am here(From Poage):

"I come back and get anyone else after I get you folks there."
Said Lyoop

"Don't be like that. Now let's go before Horn comes up with something else."
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano does have big eyes.

"...Awkay, awkay."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien pulls back

Lyoop stands up and hops off the boulder he's sitting on.

"...But ah, Cassie. While we're on the way, think I could ask ya somethin?"
Said Nephi

"Sure?"
Said Cassie-May

but I wanna wait for a good time to come in(From Scotty):

"...Whaddya think Whitney might ah... Like?"
Said Nephi

Said Alexander

"I'm plannin for the holidays, y'know."
Said Nephi

I'm gonna get these guys to the next bit and then handle the rest of you guys.(To Scotty):

BOLDFACED LIIIIESNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Alexander Hauswald blinks for a second.

"Sure yew are.Suuuuuuuure yew are."
Said Cassie-May

Alexander Hauswald starts laughing. Like, actual laughter.

"Ah mean, yer a lady. Yew know what the ladyfolk like."
Said Nephi

"Ah think she'd sure apprecciate lots if yew gave her a new copy of th' Bible or sumthin'."
Said Cassie-May

"Ah ain' exactleh th' girliest lass out there y'know."

Most everyone went out on some sort of nature hike you think? It has something to do with Alex, but

you forget what exactly. It sounds nice though, so you followed Rockett as she went to find them.

(To Poage):

"A bible works."
Said Alexander

Cassie-May O'Brien puts some distance between herself and the Indian.

Alexander Hauswald wipes a tear.

"Anyway"
Said Alexander

"Are you sure they went this way?"
Said Crystal

"...Yew think Crystal an' Rockett's followin' us?"
Said Cassie-May

fuck's sake I need another refresh

"It'd be nice if they were. Would save us a trip."
Said Nephi

(Gimmie a second)Lyoop:

"...are you sure they went this way?"
Said she

(I have, terrible bowel movements tonight.)Lyoop:

"...I have been following you..."
Said Crystal

"... Sure hope so."
Said Alexander

"An' Ah've been followin' you..."
Said Rockett

"...what'n God's name made you think followin' me was a good idea..?"

Rockett Rimjob sounds groggy and miserable.

"...I seem to recall hearing in situations like this, the first idea thing to do is find shelter."
Said Crystal

"Then food and water... I have some food with me..."

Cassie-May O'Brien holds up a hand and jogs on the log.

"Oi!"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien whistled on her fingers

"We'll try to-- ?"
Said Crystal

You got sight and movement?(To Scotty):

(you might wanna draw your Fate chips)Cassie-May O'Brien:

"...huh. Guess we were goin' tha right way."
Said Rockett

"Howdy, yew two."
Said Cassie-May

(BWWW)Crystal Saint Claire:

BRWWRockett Rimjob:

"Nice of you two to join us."
Said Alexander

"Hey Crystal!"
Said Nephi

"Told me you were bringing this many, I would have made a peace pipe."
Said Lyoop

Rockett Rimjob wipes her tired face with her hands. She doesn't look too hot.

"...Y'all okay, Rockett?"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien steps off the log to give the two space to cross

"Finding you was hard."
Said Crystal

"...Sorry to hear."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald pauses. Something dawns on him.

"Crystal."
Said Alexander

"You said a while ago you were interested in learning about huckstering?"

"...Ah can drink whiskey 'til tha sun comes up. Rum treats me well, an' even tequila of all things

ain't too bad tha day after."

Rockett Rimjob:

"But... fuckin' vodka..." she mutters as she walks by.

"...Yew need a coffee?"
Said Cassie-May

"Coulda make yew a mug."

"I can get her something better."
Said Alexander

"If it's watered down."
Said Rockett

"...For sobering."
Said Alexander

"Or normal."
Said Rockett

"...Waterin' down mah coffee?"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien looked offended.

"Ah'm sober, Alex. Ah jus' got a hell of a hangover."
Said Rockett

"I need water and I'll sober her up."
Said Alexander

"I did say that, Hauswald..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire pulls out her canteen.

"Big chest."
Said Lyoop

"Come over."

"Yeah, waterin' down yer coffee. Otherwise it'd give me a heart attack."
Said Rockett

"Oh! Hello!"
Said Crystal

"...It ain' that strong."
Said Cassie-May

((What did I learn coffin vqarnish for))Alexander Hauswald:

"Horse shit it ain't."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien looked over at the indian.

"...Rockett. Ever had Coffin Varnish?"
Said Alexander

"Other one."
Said Lyoop

Alexander Hauswald nods at Crystal. "I'll have to talk to you about that."

"Rockett, Ah think tha's yew."
Said Cassie-May

"Ah had a real bad cough last week, yeah,"
Said she

"Crystal's even flatter than meh."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Crystal

"Wut?"
Said Rockett

"Alex there's a river literally two feet from yew."
Said Nephi

(Does my mess kit have a pot?)Alexander Hauswald:

Crystal Saint Claire looks sad and squeezes her chest.

Do you have a canteen?Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"I might still grow..."
Said Crystal

Nephi does if you don't.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"..."
Said Alexander

Lyoop digs around in his leather shirt for a moment before pulling a large, hand rolled cigarette out of a

Nephi "Longiron" Delano fills his canteen with water from the stream while he's here.

"Honey the only thing growin' in yer case is a pedo's tentpitcher."
Said Rockett

"Help with hangover."
Said Lyoop

Alexander Hauswald heads to the river and fills his canteen.

Alexander Hauswald pulls his gun out and closes his eyes.

Rockett Rimjob reaches out and takes it, looking at it.

"...huh. Thanks, mister. You make this?"
Said Rockett

"Whut's in it?"

"Everything but the paper."
Said Lyoop

"... Right."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald closes the canteen.

"Tobacco, mostly."
Said Lyoop

"...this ain't gonna make me see sounds an' feel like a lizard queen like tha last thing Ah smoked

on tha reservation, is it?"

Rockett Rimjob:

"Careful, Rockett;. Might be pubes in."
Said Cassie-May

You do.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

If it's a red, you pass

If it's a black, you fail.

That's it.

"Don't know you good enough to give good stuff."
Said Lyoop

(Fetch me my deck of cards, then, please.)Alexander Hauswald:

((KING OF REDS!))Alexander Hauswald:

You just click the macros tab and you can show and draw the deckNephi "Longiron" Delano:

It's a red. Your magic works.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Alexander Hauswald taps on the canteen with his gun. It glows.

"...There we go."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald hands the canteen to Rockett.

"...whuddyew do?"
Said Cassie-May

"Made coffee."
Said Alexander

"Or what a very angry manitou thinks coffee is."

"...Yew can make coffee outta thin air?"
Said Cassie-May

"Pperently so."
Said Nephi

"..."
Said Cassie-May

"No, I can make coffee out of water."
Said Alexander

"It's bad coffee."

Rockett Rimjob looks at the cigarette. "...well. Ah don' think you'd like mah choice in tobbacco, but

Cassie-May O'Brien GLUGS

Said Cassie-May

"If I sold this I couldn't call it-"
Said Alexander

Said Nephi

Cassie-May O'Brien gives Rockett the canteen

"..."
Said Alexander

"...Yew okay there?"
Said Nephi

"...Alex."
Said Cassie-May

"...Cassie."
Said Alexander

"Mighty thirsty."
Said Lyoop

Crystal Saint Claire looks at Lyoop.

Crystal Saint Claire looks up at Lyoop.

"Yew jus' found a way straight to mah pants."
Said Cassie-May

"Oh yeah. Crystal, this is Lyoop, our new Indian friend."
Said Nephi

Also just for the record it tastes like it can't be legally called coffee.Alexander Hauswald:

Lyoop looks down at Crystal.

"Hello."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire offers a smol hand to shake.

"...That's good to know, Cassie."
Said Alexander

"Dr. Crystal Saint-Claire. Nice to meet you."
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien passed the canteen to Rockett

"How. I'm Lyoop."
Said Lyoop

"..."
Said Rockett

"Lyyyyyooooooop."
Said Crystal

Rockett Rimjob just holds onto the canteen and focuses on puffing whatever the hell this indian gave her.

Lyoop shakes Crystal's hand with his leathery callused one.

"That's a fun name to say!"
Said Crystal

"Mmmm, thought so too."
Said Lyoop

"Why I took it."

how much money did rockett make from russians(From Rockett Rimjob):

"C'mon gals. Let's get goin."
Said Nephi

"Lyoop, lead the way."
Said Nephi

((Out of the Lyoop))Alexander Hauswald:

((Reeeeeeeeeeee))Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

You feel a calmness spreading through you Rockett. Not really fuzziness or lack of focus or

distracting visions or thoughts, just calm.

(To Scotty):

Also twenty bucks.(To Scotty):

"Why did we go here.. It was... someting you had to do, right Hauswald?"
Said Crystal

"Yes."
Said Alexander

"Did you ever figure out what it was?"
Said Crystal

"Horn said 'Red-handed man'."
Said Alexander

"All of you ready?"
Said Lyoop

"Yep."
Said Alexander

Lyoop takes a few steps towards the edge of the clearing.

Crystal Saint Claire follows close behind.

Alexander Hauswald follows, trying to talk to Crystal.

Cassie-May O'Brien follows, hand near her revolver

"...So as I was saying."
Said Alexander

"Follow me, don't try to leave path I'm walking."
Said Lyoop

Crystal Saint Claire tries to stay as close as is safe, because if she gets to far away she might loose sight

of Lyoop.

"Don't take anything."
Said Lyoop

"Yes sir."
Said Crystal

"Or...?"
Said Cassie-May

"Bad things."
Said Alexander

"Different things."
Said Lyoop

"Might belong to something else."

twenty bucks for that? all right(From Rockett Rimjob):

"Might be poison."
Said Lyoop

take it she's givin' us a ride(From Rockett Rimjob):

"...Eeish."
Said Nephi

"I did mention an interest in learning the Huckster's trade..."
Said Crystal

"Good."
Said Alexander

Lyoop walks off into the dark embrace of the woods.

"I bought Hoyle's Book of Games a while ago."
Said Alexander

"Oh, good! That should help, no?"
Said Crystal

"It's almost neccesary."
Said Alexander

"Hoyle hid every spell he could find inside the book- it's all in complex codes and diagrams.

Cassie-May O'Brien listens in to the two

the fourth edition there's a good chunk left."

Alexander Hauswald:

"So between me and the book, I think I can teach you some Hexslinging."

"I would be more comfortable starting with theory, if that is okay..."
Said Crystal

"Of course. First we just have to see if you can crack the code."
Said Alexander

"Code-crackin', yew say?"
Said Cassie-May

"You're a smart girl but Huckstering isn't an exact science-"
Said Alexander

"I just said. Hoyle hid his lessons and spells in the book."

Lyoop takes all of you on a winding path through the woods. As you get further in, it

feels like you should cross the path you were walking before, but the trees are perpetually unfamiliar. At some

stones are getting less moss covered as the path winds on. The woods get darker, and darker. Soon, it is difficult

to see the bright colors in Lyoop's clothes. Then, the Indian pushes through a dense patch of brush and emerges

into sunlight. He motions for the rest of you to follow.

Crystal Saint Claire follows, shielding her eyes from the sudden light.

Rockett Rimjob puffs

can't see(From Rockett Rimjob):

Give us a tick.

Alexander Hauswald follows as well.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano feels weird.

Lyoop stands back from the rest of the group and does not set foot on the path.

"Whut's this place?"
Said Cassie-May

"Old lumber town."
Said Lyoop

"Forgot by most people."

"Only a few remember it."

"...It's so green."
Said Nephi

"Is there somewhere to sleep? I am... suddenly exhausted..."
Said Crystal

"...Ain't seen this much green in a long time."
Said Nephi

Lyoop points to the furthest building.

Crystal Saint Claire takes a deep breath...

Alexander Hauswald just smiles gently.

Crystal Saint Claire exhales.

"Big dining hall."
Said Lyoop

"Sure they can accommodate in there."

There is a statue sitting in a pool in the middle of the town square.

It looks ancient.

Moss is growing over the base of it.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads over to look at it.

Crystal Saint Claire makes a note to look at it when she's not exhausted.

"...Yew two comin'?Cassie-May O'Brien:

Alexander Hauswald gived the statue a look.

"This is not a place for me."
Said Lyoop

"Ah'm comin', jus'... sumbitch, this headache..."
Said Rockett

"That wus not worth twenny bucks..."

"I'll be waiting outside, if you want to go back."
Said Lyoop

"Hello..."
Said Crystal

Lyoop turns and goes back through the hole in the brush.

Crystal Saint Claire yawns...

you never told me how much brass knuckles would cost(From Rockett Rimjob):

Hod turns to look at Crystal. His eyes are unfocused and his clothes are ragged.

"Hello."
Said Hod

"Who is it?"

"...oooh."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob peeks her head in

Sigyn crosses her arms across her chest and looks down at Crystal.

"A little girl, Hod."
Said Sigyn

"My name is Crystal..."
Said Crystal

"Anythin' interestin'?"
Said Cassie-May

"Hola, amigos."
Said Gun

"D...do you have a bed available? I can pay, if that helps..."
Said Crystal

Is that the same gun runner(From Crystal Saint Claire):

"Amigas,"
Said she

Please let that be the same gun runner(From Crystal Saint Claire):

"...And Hauswald."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob looks as he enters.

Alexander Hauswald nods.

It should always be the same goddamn mexican(From Crystal Saint Claire):

"You see something you like?"
Said Gun

"...I don't suppose I can turn in a few guns?"
Said Alexander

"Buenas tardes."
Said Rockett

It is, and for a reason.(To Poage):

Rockett Rimjob looks at the guns on the table.

"This is the feasting hall...but..."
Said Hod

Is he Crazy Hassan? Some sort of highly powerful being?(From Crystal Saint Claire):

"I'm sure I can make a bed for you."
Said Hod

"Do you have a blanket and a table I could sleep under?"
Said Crystal

"I am not picky..."

The shotgun is beautiful Rockett. A fine double barrel with a stout stock on it.Gun Runner:

"...Oooh."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob picks it up and inspects it.

"I'll make you a bedroll sweetie."
Said Sigyn

"Were those your friends out there?"

"Careful with the merchandise."
Said Gun

"Yes..."
Said Crystal

Cassie-May O'Brien inspects the rifles

"I have several guns too many. Any chance I can turn them in?"
Said Alexander

"Ah break it, Ah buy it. But speakin' of buyin'."
Said Rockett

Crystal Saint Claire stretches, and her sleeves slip down a bit before she tugs them back in place.

what's the stats(From Rockett Rimjob):

"Friends?"
Said Hod

"How many?"

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire mentally counts.

"Five..?"
Said Crystal

I'll make up stats in a bit. Know that it is a decent upgrade from a regular double barrel.(To Scotty):

(brb getting coffee)Alexander Hauswald:

The rifles look to be well made, even if they are all the same. A reliable looking lever action with no

apparent model number or maker's mark.

Gun Runner:

"Let me see what you've got to sell man. I'm sure I can cut you a deal."
Said Gun

"...Where ya got 'em from?"
Said Cassie-May

"Oh... do you know anything about a man... with red hands?"
Said Crystal

"Fell off back of a wagon."
Said Gun

"Hmm."
Said Cassie-May

"Clumsy wagon drivers chu know."
Said Gun

"Eeeeyup."
Said Cassie-May

"Hauswald was supposed to find someone."
Said Crystal

Gun Runner turns to Rockett for a moment.

"Que?"
Said Gun

Cassie-May O'Brien doesn't even touch them

"Ah, that one."
Said Gun

Crystal Saint Claire holds her bag tight to her chest.

Rockett Rimjob looks a little confused. "Fifty? Fer somethin' that fell off tha back of a wagon?"

Alexander Hauswald reaches into his pack and pulls out two colt navies.

"What'll you give me for these?Alexander Hauswald:

Hod stays silent as Crystal speaks. The lips of the woman beside him flatten against her face for a

moment. Her eyes show a flash of pain. The man touches one hand with the other, absently.

"No one like that here."
Said Hod

"For those?"
Said Gun

"Okay... Sorry to trouble you."
Said Crystal

"I will find somewhere to sleep. Thank you for having me under your roof."

"And Miss, I did not say that one fell off the back of a wagon."
Said Gun

"That one."

"She is my prize."

"My baby."

Crystal Saint Claire is not particularly perceptive.

"Where'd you get 'er?"
Said Rockett

"Five dollars for both?"
Said Alexander

"Rich guy, liked to hunt a lot."
Said Gun

"Ordered custom made."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks over the guns.,

"Unfortunate."
Said Gun

"Got mauled by bear."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks back to his gatling rifle, then shrugs.

"So, I kept the gun."
Said Gun

"Damn shame."
Said Rockett

("Such is life in the North")Crystal Saint Claire:

"It come with tha case?"
Said Rockett

"And yes, five for both beard man."
Said Gun

"...Fair enough.Alexander Hauswald:

"is a good deal."
Said Gun

Alexander Hauswald hands the guns.

Rockett Rimjob cracks open the action. 10 or 12 gauge?

I gtg, sorry... Can Crystal bunk down and pass out?(From Crystal Saint Claire):

"...I don't suppose you have a a two-action .44 revolver?"
Said Alexander

Yes. The red headed woman takes Crystal to the side and gives her something to drink before going

to find a bedroll for her.

(To Poage):

Ten gauge Rockett.Gun Runner:

"I might, I might."

Crystal accepts the drink, and drinks it.(From Crystal Saint Claire):

"Look over on the other table."
Said Gun

I gotta head out, all. I'm excited to see where we go!Crystal Saint Claire:

The drink is sweet, and warm. It tastes like honey.(To Poage):

Alexander Hauswald nods and heads over to examine the table.

Rockett Rimjob rests the gun on her shoulder, crook of the action on her collar bone. Then, she digs out

her wallet.

"Fifty, ya said?"
Said Rockett

Sacks sniffs the things. Sacks sniffs all the things.

"Feef tee."
Said Gun

It smells old Sacks, very old.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano wonders just how old this place could be.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano rubs his chin.

"...Hmm..."
Said Nephi

"Something doesn't add up..."

"Whuzzin 'ere?"
Said Cassie-May

"Nothin' but me."
Said General

"Dunno. Looked like more shops."
Said Nephi

Sacks tries to sniff all the old.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has his hands in the pocket of his duster coat.

General Store Owner has his legs propped up on the counter as he reads through a book.

"Ah got an ol' scattergun, too. How much would you fork over for it?" she asks, holding out a $50

bill to the man.

Rockett Rimjob:

"Not in bad shape. Ain't in great shape, but... y'know, function over fashion."

"How long's this place been here, mister?"
Said Nephi

((...Remind me what does C&B means, ammowise?))Sacks:

Cap and Ball.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Means reloading takes way longer.

Alexander Hauswald picks them up, examining them gently.

You get one round per two or three actions instead of one round per action.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Cassie-May O'Brien eyeballs through the shelves in search o anything that would catch her eye.

The black one looks like it might be a double action. One next to it is a little older, and the one on

the far end looks to be a single action. Calibers seem to be .44, .44, and .32.

Gun Runner:

"I'd have to see the gun senorita."

"See anything you like, Cassie?"
Said Nephi

"Probably about seven bucks for a shotty."
Said Gun

Alexander Hauswald lifts the first two, examining them closely.

Rockett Rimjob yoinks it out of her pack, holding it by the barrel.

Rockett Rimjob holds the handle out.

There's several things here Cassie, but you know what you're really looking for. They got

General Store Owner:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano just watches Cassie go about her shopping

Cassie-May O'Brien licked her lips and examined those closer

Nephi "Longiron" Delano had never gone shopping with Cassie before

Gun Runner grabs the gun by the handle. He examines the outside for a minute before cracking open the

leaves it closed.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is starting to get more than a little unnerved.

"Is good, for you, I will make it eight dollars."
Said Gun

Gun Runner takes Rockett's fifty and her gun. He hands back a five dollar greenback and four one dollar

Rockett Rimjob takes the money. Then, she holds out one coin back to him.

The coffee comes in only one size, the big tin. Picking it up and smelling in between the

join of the lid gives you a strong odor that tingles somewhere at the base of your brain. This is the good stuff.

General Store Owner:

Gun Runner holds his hands up in protest.

"Senorita."
Said Gun

"...Uuuuunnnnh.."
Said Cassie-May

"Please."
Said Gun

"...What's that coffee?"
Said Cassie-May

"Five an' three makes eight. You gave me four coins."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob holds it out.

entire gun feels heavy in your hand. The lighter colored gun's action is single, but it works like a dream. It is a

balanced weight in your hand, not too much, not too little.

Gun Runner:

Gun Runner takes the coin back.

"Maybe I was trying to get in on your good side, hey?"
Said Gun

"..."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald sets the heavy one down, smiling.

"Good coffee."
Said General

"How much for this little beauty?"
Said Alexander

Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads inside here, and waves hello

"Don't go snortin' it up now."
Said General

Nephi "Longiron" Delano takes a look around

Rockett Rimjob chuckles a little, at that. "Hey, now. Ah work fer ev'ry dollar Ah earn," she says simply.

"Pleasure doin' business, though."

"That much Ah can smell... Where'd yew git it from?"
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimjob packs the shotgun into the case, then takes it with her.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano seems increasingly... Distressed, the more time passes.

"Is it someone new?"
Said Hod

"Looking for something dear?"
Said Sigyn

"Maybe. Dunno."
Said Nephi

"Ain't we all?"

There's also the smell of something like honey and roasting chicken.

That's it.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has only ever seen swords in the art the church puts out every so often.

"...Are you two blacksmiths?"
Said Nephi

"Good shooting cactus flower."
Said Gun

Cassie-May O'Brien stares at the coffee tin for a long moment, then hastily puts it back on the shelf

"Because that looks like a forge, over there."
Said Nephi

"For that one beard man..."
Said Gun

Rockett Rimjob gives Sacks scratches.

"What is this place?"
Said Cassie-May

"Twenty."
Said Gun

"A good place that people forgot about."
Said General

"...Hrm."
Said Alexander

"Forgot how long ago, eh?"
Said Cassie-May

"Never met a blacksmith that still makes swords, though."
Said Nephi

Alexander Hauswald looks at the gun.

"Do you have somewhere I can test it?"
Said Alexander

"That is not a forge."
Said Hod

"That is where we roast the chickens."

"Sometimes goat."

"Huh. My mistake."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks at the... dog?

"Wouldn't shoot it around here."
Said Gun

"How long you think?"
Said General

"Longer than people are alive."
Said Cassie-May

"...How long are yew here?"

"Didn't think you do. Would trading my old Colt Army help the price any?"
Said Alexander

Cassie-May O'Brien looks on edge

"Me?"
Said General

"Ain't been around too long myself."

((...Now I'm wondering things.))Alexander Hauswald:

"...Numbers, pardnah."
Said Cassie-May

"And every town exists longer than some folk are alive."
Said General

"Depends on the folk you're talkin' about."

"I know a fair few of the founders done kicked the bucket."

"...Lyoop told us nawt ta touch or take anythin'."
Said Cassie-May

"...did 'e?"
Said Rockett

Gm. Still taking a look at this "Dog"Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Knock it down to..."
Said Gun

Alexander Hauswald is currently holding a gun

"Eh..."
Said Gun

"...An' nawt many lil' towns happen in the middle of nowhere wit' indians leadin' us to after

Manitou told 'em to."

Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Thirteen dollars."
Said Gun

"Eeeyup, Rockett."
Said Cassie-May

"..."
Said Rockett

"...Thirteen works."
Said Alexander

Rockett Rimjob looks at her braaaand new shotgun case.

"Don't worry Miss."
Said General

Alexander Hauswald pulls out the money and the gun.

I'll try again later.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"That's on the way here."
Said General

Alexander Hauswald squints at the seller, trying to understand if something does seem off or he's

Ok sorryNephi "Longiron" Delano:

"...On th' way where, exactly? Whut's the name of this place?"
Said Cassie-May

Valdyrbinda is curled up next to the man with ragged attire. The dog is covered in what looks to be

brands. Chain like brands. The fur on it is black as pitch.

"...Nice dog."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is increasingly unsettled.

"You can pet him if you want."
Said Sigyn

"I've only known him to bite Tyr."

"...Sure."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano gently pets the dog a few times after letting him smell his hand.

((Should we make an order so Doc doesn't have to run back and forth between all of us?))Alexander Hauswald:

Said Alexander

Valdyrbinda tail wags a few times as Nephi pets him. He stretches and gets up to sniff at Nephi's pants

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is certain there's something wrong with this town, now.

I pet a dogValdyrbinda:

CONSPIRACIES CONFIRMED

Well hold on I was getting there.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"...On th' way where, exactly? Whut's the name of this place?"
Said Cassie-May

"Town's called Aldin Fold."General Store Owner:000000

Nephi "Longiron" Delano sighs, pushing it away for a moment.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano just pets the dog.

"You came here through the forest path didntcha?"
Said General

"...Eeeyup."
Said Cassie-May

"Y'all have a nice day, I'm going to see my other compadre's."
Said Nephi

"That's the way."
Said General

I'm going to go find the others.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

(wait your turn neph)Sacks:

"Need a guide for that path."
Said General

I'm finished for now.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Them's a red-handed man 'ere?"
Said Cassie-May

"Goodbye for now dear, come back soon."
Said Sigyn

"Not in town, but I'm sure you'll find who you're looking for if you look around enough."
Said General

"...Right."
Said Cassie-May

"Hey ca-"
Said Nephi

"Bye for now."
Said General

"You want anything young feller?"

"Ahem."
Said Nephi

Cassie-May O'Brien storms out and - after spending a moment to catch her thoughts - looks at the

fountain properly.

"You got any of those ah... Trail rations?"
Said Nephi

"Could use some food for the road."

"Down there behind you."
Said General

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks around for a few cans o'beans, canned bread, that sort of thing.

"Next to the travel canteens."
Said General

Nephi "Longiron" Delano picks out a few days worth. Just in case.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano tries to get as good a spread as local conditions will allow.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano brings them over to the counter when he's done.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano will wait til Alex is done.

"...On second thought, here's 20. I'll keep my old gun."
Said Sacks

HERE'S SOME HAIR OF THE DOG THAT BIT YAGun Runner:

BLAM BLAM

((Also it's 4:15 for me let's wrap it up quick and go to bed?))Alexander Hauswald:

Gun Runner takes Alex's twenty and stuff it into his pocket.

"Have fun with that piece."
Said Gun

"What can you tell me about it?"
Said Alexander

"Got it from a smuggler."
Said Gun

"Wanted something a little bit bigger."

"Was a hard to get it though."

"Damn gringo got me to up the trade in for his sentimental value."

"...Did you get all of your guns from other people?"
Said Alexander

"Don't grow on trees."
Said Gun

"You know what I mean."
Said Alexander

"I do, but you gotta learn how to ask the right question gringo."
Said Gun

"...Are these all dead men's guns?"
Said Alexander

"Smuggler's not dead that I know."
Said Gun

"And the factory made those rifles sure ain't dead."

"Hm. Fair enough."
Said Alexander

Alexander Hauswald is suspicious again but not enough to raise accusations yet.

"Good day, sir."
Said Alexander

"See you later beard."
Said Gun

(Eh. NPC me if needed.)Alexander Hauswald:

KGun Runner:

((Still got things planned for this sesh?))Alexander Hauswald:

I can keep doing things as long as you guys keep looking around at stuff.General Store Owner:

If you want to pause it here, that's fine.

Gimmie a tick.General Store Owner:

Ball is in my court with this one.

I'm fine with pausing rn so I could sleep and Doc could negotiate a surrender tready with

his intestines

Alexander Hauswald:

General Store Owner looks over the vast array of tinned fish that Nephi has brought to the counter. There

are sardines and anchovies and more sardines. The variety is stunning.

WaitNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Is that all there was?

Not just a variety of fish, a variety of everything!

There's tinned fish, nuts in a jar, and some good looking jerky.General Store Owner:

Don't worry.General Store Owner:

That comes later.

Got some of all three.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"I'll take it. How much?"

"Looks to be about...four dollars worth."
Said General

Nephi "Longiron" Delano pays!

How many days worth of food?Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

General Store Owner takes Nephi's money and pops it into the register drawer.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano pays in four one-dollar coins from the coin purse he keeps hidden on his body

Nephi "Longiron" Delano puts it in his pack

Cassie-May O'Brien storms out and - after spending a moment to catch her thoughts - looks at the

fountain properly.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano thanks the shopkeep and then heads out to the fountain

facial features look familiar. You've seen cheeks and a nose like that somewhere before.

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien wracks her brain, trying to figure out where she saw that face before

Roll knowledge.

Just straight Knowledge?Cassie-May O'Brien:

Do you have any subsets that would be relevant?

Occult and Home County I guess?Cassie-May O'Brien:

Neither of which would be helpful in this case.

Home County refers to the region you grew up in.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

You didn't grow up here. Probably.

Cassie-May O'Brien:01

That's it.

It was on a delivery to a settlement out by the seashore.

A little place called Aegir.

There were lots of tall, muscley dock workers around there.

Most of them blond.

"......"
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien looks for any inscriptions on the fountain or figure

"A grr?"
Said Nephi

"A grrrl?"

"Aegir. 'S name of tha' lil' settlement Ah visited once..."
Said Cassie-May

Just, go ahead and roll to punch Nephi.

"...You been here before?"

There is a small inscription at the base of the statue.

"Here? Naw. But them people there had faces like that."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien pointed at the writing.0

"Them's Norse words."
Said Cassie-May

Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads over to take a look

"Norse?"
Said Nephi

"What's that?"

"Scandinavian. Old world."
Said Cassie-May

"Oh."
Said Nephi

"Tha' means nothin' to ye, eh."
Said Cassie-May

"Might mean somethin to my da. He's French."
Said Nephi

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimjob fucking facepalms.

Cassie-May O'Brien pinched the bridge of her nose

It's Nephi, in this case.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"..."
Said Cassie-May

"That's close enough, right?"
Said Nephi

In this case

"No."
Said Rockett

Nephi's dad is a doctor of Engineering, not geography.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

shet I forgot to do the thing with the history and stuff(From Rockett Rimjob):

"Whut's a fuckin' Viking statue doin' in th' middle of America?"
Said Cassie-May

And he's generally more interested in-Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Oh my god is this Brigadoon?

watCassie-May O'Brien:

"...these folks don't look like Norskis."
Said Rockett

Brigadoon. It's a movie from about 50 years ago about an Irish village that only

appears once every 100 years.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

how do I add points for knowledge of stuff(From Rockett Rimjob):

"But the statue gal sure does."
Said Cassie-May

It's a beautiful peaceful place that's still in the middle ages more or lessNephi "Longiron" Delano:

And it can appear anywhere and is generally wonderful and nice even though it usually happens to be in the

middle of a bog or something.

I have never heard of that.

Look it up, it's very interesting if you like classic movies.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

can I roll to knowledgeify thisRockett Rimjob:

does it have anything to do with history or is it some other horseshit rockett knows nothing about

Mythology.

sooo noRockett Rimjob:

There you go.

can i try anywayRockett Rimjob:

You can always try.

Rockett Rimjob:

Rockett thinks really hard. She can remember that this is totally something to do with

Norse stuff, but that's about it.

"...Hm."
Said Rockett

"...never really could focus on that chapter," she mutters to herself.

"Ah dunno," she says, turning to Cass. "'M stumped."

Cassie-May O'Brien scratched her head.

"...Whut if Ah say Ah'm gunna let yew count th' freckles on mah ass if yew think harder?"
Said Cassie-May

"Somethin real weird's goin on here."
Said Nephi

"...Cass."
Said Rockett

"Eye candy ain't always tha solution."

"You fellas seen the dog they keep around here?"
Said Nephi

"Sides. Ah've done that anyway."
Said Rockett

"...When?"
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimjob looks back at the statue.

"An' whut dog?"
Said Cassie-May

"In the big building."
Said Nephi

"They got a dog in there."0

"Oh. Ah wuzn' there yet."
Said Cassie-May

"...A uh... "
Said Dog

"Makes Sacks here look like a showdog."

"...Er... No offense, Sacks."

"...Ah just..."

"Places like this make me feel real uncomfortable."
Said Nephi

"...It's too... Nice."

"Even home's not like this."

"Sumthin's definetely off 'bout this place 'ere."
Said Cassie-May

"The best parts of Salt Lake City still got more smog than you can fan away."
Said Nephi

"..."
Said Rockett

"But everything's nice and green here. The people are nice enough."
Said Nephi

"Ah've been to better homes. Ah think you unnerestimate parts of Salt Lake."
Said Rockett

"Some'a them pastors have real nice homes."

"I don't want to hear about it, Rockett."
Said Nephi

"Some of those men might have been my bishop at some point."

"Couple of 'em ain't bishops no more."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob says nonchalantly as she drinks from the flask she got from Hauswald.

A dun fucked the holy out of em.

"To be expected. It's not a permanent appointment."
Said Nephi

"...I didn't grow up in the nice parts, anyways."

"...Anyway."
Said Cassie-May

"Wouldn'Nephi "
Said Longiron

t know where to look to find em, ah guess."

"Somewhere outta town where they're outta range of pitchforks an' torches."
Said Rockett

"Think Ah ain' gunna think up anythin' else. Ah need sum' sleep, as much as Ah hate it."
Said Cassie-May

"I was gonna mention it."
Said Nephi

"Yew got a real coffee problem, Cassie."

"And I mean a PROBLEM."

"...An' ya weren't kiddin' when ya said ya toss an' turn a bunch,"
Said she

"A sorta bishop-pulls-you-out-of-sacrament kind of problem."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano nods along to what Rockett says, then...

"...Wait, how would yew know?"
Said Nephi

Cassie-May O'Brien crossed her arms.

"Shared a hotel room not long ago. She kicked me a few times."
Said Rockett

Cassie-May O'Brien looked away.

"Same night Ah drank ten bucks worth'a whiskey.Rockett Rimjob:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks at Cassie's reaction then at Rockett's reaction.

'Woz worth it, wuzn' it."Cassie-May O'Brien:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano quirks an eyebrow.

Said Cassie-May

"...I'd say somethin about god not likin when yew do that, but..."
Said Nephi

"...I don't think it'd make any difference, really."

"...Just... Keep it clean, alright ladies?"

"Aye, dad."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien rolled her eyes.

"...Naw, that's Alex."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano grins

"She ain't payed me money. We was clean."

"...Enh."
Said Nephi

"Why would..."

'"Yew started it."Cassie-May O'Brien:

"Feel free ta git kicked more by me in mah sleep, if yew wanna."
Said Cassie-May

"Keep your eyes open."
Said Nephi

"Can't sleep like tha', Nephi."
Said Cassie-May

"Cassie."
Said Nephi

"If anyone could find a way."

"It would be you."

"Snerk."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien grinned and shook her head

"Y'all ain't the only ones that can bring some sharp tongues to the table, y'know."
Said Nephi

"Ah know. Sacks got a foul mouth on him like tha'."
Said Cassie-May

"Dogs're like that."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano slowly leans down with his back to the base of the fountain, sitting on the

ground with his rifle leaning up against his shoulder.

"...Actually."
Said Nephi

"You know what's missing here?"

"For anyone."

"Why does nobody here have a bed?"

"...Got a strange feelin' man nightmares gunna be werse than usual tonight."
Said Cassie-May

"...Them don't need sleep?"

"Cassie, not everybody drinks coffee like you."
Said Nephi

". . ."
Said Cassie-May

"Maybe we should ask tha folks here."
Said Rockett

"Folks need sleep."
Said Nephi

Cassie-May O'Brien suddenly blanched a bit.

"I looked in every building in this place and there's not a single bed."
Said Nephi

"Where are the beds"

"...Mahbe we oughta set up watches."
Said Cassie-May

"Naw beds... Them's only a few critters tha' don't sleep in beds."

"Don't know about that."
Said Nephi

"But I know it's mighty unusual."

"Suspicious."
Said Cassie-May

". . ."

Cassie-May O'Brien swung her backpack off

Cassie-May O'Brien knelt down

Cassie-May O'Brien pulled out one of the coffee tins

Nephi "Longiron" Delano watches with some interest.

Rockett Rimjob looks.

Cassie-May O'Brien looked at the fountain suspiciously

Cassie-May O'Brien shook her head

Cassie-May O'Brien just fucking ate like half a pound of coffee from the tin like a wild animal

"..."
Said Rockett

"Ah'm takin', munchmunch, first watch."
Said Cassie-May

"gross"
Said Rockett

"...Cassie."
Said Nephi

"Please never do that again."

Cassie-May O'Brien licked her fingers from coffee grounds and packed back up

"That's the most disgusting thing I've seen and I've seen my da's anatomical

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Okay holy shit.

"Ah've seen worse."
Said Rockett

That is actually goddamn terrifying.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano visibly moves away from Cassie after that

"Yew need HELP."
Said Nephi

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien G U L P S .

"...Buh."
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimjob rubs her eyes.

"...Yew know I got a canteen too, right?"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano holds it out.

"Just... fethin take it."
Said Nephi

"...gonna go see if they got anywhere ta rest," she says, turning to head north.Rockett Rimjob:

"...oh."
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimjob holds her canteen out to Cass.

"Rockett. They don't."
Said Nephi

"Crystal asked."

"An' they said no?"
Said Rockett

"Yeah."
Said Nephi

"Think so."

Crystal is literally in there napping on a bed roll.

OhNephi "Longiron" Delano:

Cassie-May O'Brien takes the canteen and takes a few gulps, sloshing then around in her mouth to clean

off the coffee residue

"Thanks."
Said Cassie-May

"...You know what else I realized this town doesn't have?"
Said Nephi

"...Why tha shit..."
Said Rockett

Rockett Rimjob was gonna look at Crystal and see where she got the bedroll but then she notices the

fucking viking weapons

"This town doesn't make any sense."
Said Nephi

"Howd-"
Said Cassie-May

"Hey, Miss, you're one of the little girl's friends, right?"
Said Sigyn

"Guess so."
Said Rockett

Nephi "Longiron" Delano stays by the fountain, still armed, watching and waiting.

"I'll get you a bedroll and some mead."
Said Sigyn

"There's chicken roasting too, if you want some."

"...Naw. Naw, thanks."
Said Cassie-May

"Ah had coffee."

"...is that a no to the..."
Said Sigyn

"Both."
Said Cassie-May

"Okay."
Said Sigyn

Sigyn looks at Rockett instead of the crazy ass lady.

"..."
Said Cassie-May

"Well, I'll get things set up for you."
Said Sigyn

"What's with tha..."
Said Rockett

"Medieval stuff?"

Rockett Rimjob gestures to the table.

Cassie-May O'Brien just leans on the wall, pulling her hat deeper over her eyes.

"Something we brought over from the old country."
Said Sigyn

"You always have to keep something from home with you."

"You from Norway?"
Said Rockett

"We came to America from there, yes."
Said Sigyn

Hod bends down to scratch behind the dog's ears.

Rockett Rimjob glances at the dog, but doesn't stare for long. "Explains a few things. Ah was worried y'all

were Swedes fer a second," she teases.

Hod chuckles for a moment as he lavishes affection on the dog.

"No, not quite."
Said Hod

"We came from our home to America seeking a new world."

"We found it."

"And it has lost us."

Cassie-May O'Brien looks up

"Whut were yer names again?"
Said Cassie-May

"I am Hod."
Said Hod

"Whadaya mean, it's lost ya?"
Said Rockett

"This is Valdyrbinda."
Said Hod

Hod pats the dog.

"And that is Sigyn."
Said Hod

Hod raises an arm and an open palmed hand in the direction of the red haired woman.

Rockett Rimjob gives her a nod.

"A pleasure."
Said Rockett

How much would Cassie know about Norse mythology though?Hod:

from a tattered, leatherbound tome. Sigyn was the name of one of the characters. The wife of a mischief maker.

"..."
Said Cassie-May

"...Sigyn. Ah recognize that name."

Sigyn quirks her head at Cassie.

"Do you?"
Said Sigyn

"From tales of mah mom... Sigyn, wife o' mischief maker."
Said Cassie-May

"...Yew got no beds,"

"Or outhouse,:

"Not here, this is the feasting hall."
Said Sigyn

"And we've never had a problem using the natural bounty of the forest."

"Ya never gone tha way of tha deer, Cass?"Rockett Rimjob:00

"There's a real darn old viking statue in th' yard an' we're in th' center of Montana."
Said Cassie-May

"Just squat an' use a fern after,"
Said she

"Things from our home."
Said Sigyn

"...An' yew got name o' old god. An' them's axes and swords an' all here."
Said Cassie-May

Sigyn leans on the mead fountain.

Cassie-May O'Brien angrily pulled her glove off to scratch at the sun-like scar on her palm.

"...Y'all ain' exactly human, are yew."
Said Cassie-May

Rockett Rimjob looks at Cass like she's snorted a little too much coffee grounds.

"...Cass."
Said Rockett

"Now dear, what would give you an idea like that?"
Said Sigyn

("They're Norskis. Not negroes.")(From Rockett Rimjob):

Goddamit. I snorted.(To Scotty):

"Experience."
Said Cassie-May

"Mahbe it's th' fact we got led here by a damn injun who warned us nawt ta take anythin

"Mahbe it's 'cuz he done that fer a Manitou."

Hod has stopped petting the dog. He stands and regards Cassie with blind eyes.

"Mahbe th' fact this place jus' doesn' fit in Montana."
Said Cassie-May

"Or mahbe it's jus' mah gut feelin' tha' sumthin's off here."

"...Cass maybe ya need a little sleep,"
Said she

"We do not seek to harm you."
Said Hod

"Whut's the catch?"
Said Cassie-May

"There is no catch."
Said Hod

"This hall welcomes any who come to it."

"Why?"
Said Cassie-May

"Because it does."
Said Hod

"Everyone needs a place to rest."

"To eat and drink and be in good company."

"I remember when it was filled to bursting."

"The laughter and the joy."

Hod paws at his ragged garments as his eyes wander across the room. His head turning to look at

something that only he can see.

"Soon, it will be empty."
Said Hod

"...Who are yew...?"
Said Cassie-May

"I am Hod, as I always have been. As I always will be."
Said Hod

"..."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien stumbled back a step.

"...Ah think... Ah think Ah oughta git some sleep after all."
Said Cassie-May

Cassie-May O'Brien looks mindfucked.

Cassie-May O'Brien just slumped in the corner

"Sleep well, all of you."
Said Sigyn

"You can meet the others in the morning."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano sits by the fountain and just watches...

"...y'all got any bread an' mead?"
Said Rockett

All of you get situated in your places and turn in for the night. Most in the feasting hall,

others by the fountain. At some point, Sigyn and Hod leave. They do not close the door of the hall. There is no

door to close. Night falls soon, and each of you dreams deep of strange places. Some dream of a cave with three

pillars. Some dream of the feeling of mistletoe. Some dream of a wolf swallowing the moon and the sun.

of the others with Rockett. When you come out, you realize it is rather early in the next day. You exit the town and

take a look at the forest for, well, no reason at all. Certainly nothing to do with anything behind the scenes. As you

walk from the town of Moose into the lush forest around it, you come upon a clearing. A brook burbles, leaves

You can move and see and junk right?(To Yuppie b.):

yes(From Yuppie b.):

Whitney G. Elieen felt groggy...among other things. Best not to think about those other things just yet. No

what she needed to do was to walk. The clearing looked as good as any.

The noise though was curious...Whitney G. Elieen:

Whitney G. Elieen clunked her way forward, towards the babbling brook

Lyoop sits on a boulder on the other side of the brook. He is dressed in old, sun tanned leather, furs, and

feathers. A small pile of stones sits next to him. He watches Whitney as she approaches, picks a stone up,

and skips it across the brook. It comes to rest on top of Whitney's left shoe.

Whitney G. Elieen looks down at the stone that was thrown towards her. Bending downward to pick it up.

Grasping it tight in her hands, she smiles and waves her free one at the native0

"You."
Said Lyoop

"Got look about."

"With the others?"

"The others...yes." She says, noticing his broken English. Perhaps this would be a good time

to brush up on her native. She could not speak in tongues, at least not yet, but she did have a gift for them.

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Yes I am with them."

Lyoop gets up with a slow, fluid grace. He steps off the rock and lands on the ground in a crouch. The

"Come."
Said Lyoop

"Show you the way."

Whitney G. Elieen nods her head as the giantess makes her way out towards the log...

Roll nimbleness.Lyoop:

Whitney G. Elieen:

I fucking spit out my drink.Lyoop:

YesWhitney G. Elieen:

of wood. The log snaps in two and dumps you into the stream of water. It is cold. Your fingers go numb before you

can push yourself up and out of the water. You're pretty sure your nipples are about to shear through your dress

as you crawl up the bank.

"A..aaah!!"
Said Whitney

Lyoop walks over and holds a hand out to Whitney as she attempts to leave the brook.

Whitney G. Elieen her massive weight snaps the very log in two! Sending the poor woman falling into the

cold water! By the time she is out of there, she is soaking and miserable...

Whitney G. Elieen reaches her hand out...

(brb dinner)Whitney G. Elieen:

(tell me when you get back)Lyoop:

"Hmm..."
Said Lyoop

(I mean here)Poage:00

"Can't leave you in cold, wet clothes."
Said Lyoop

"Make a detour for you, before we go to where your friends went."

Lyoop pats Whitney's sopping wet shoulder.

Gettin' Whitney to were you guys are at, give me a tick.(To Poage):

No problem!(From Crystal Saint Claire):

Crystal is still nappin' in a bundle of blankets under a table.(From Crystal Saint Claire):

Nevermore is here

BLBLBWhitney G. Elieen:

I return

"Yes...yes thank you..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen said, holding her shoulders in her own hands.

"M..much appreciated..."
Said Whitney

(just a tick)Lyoop:

Lyoop walks towards the dense forest. Once he gets to the edge of it, he turns and looks at Whitney.

"You comin'?"
Said Lyoop

should there be music playing?(From Poage):

I can't hear anything(From Poage):

Whitney G. Elieen follows right along, making full use of her long stride

"R..right behind you..."
Said Whitney

Lyoop walks through the woods, following a winding path that seems to turn in on itself several times.

There is no familiar terrain though, every tree looks different than the last. Lyoop takes a hard right after

what feels like hours of walking and emerges into the light. He keeps the branches and brambles parted

for Whitney to pass through.

emerge into a place with no greenery, the only break in the dirt and rocks is a blue steaming spring.

"Here."
Said Lyoop

"Throw clothes onto rock to dry."

"Warm in spring."

"I smoke and wait."

Whitney G. Elieen feels herself led along the long, confusing path. Distracted by the alien terrain as she

contends with her discomfort. Eventually though, after a time, they come across a site most welcome...a

smile tugging at her lips.

"God bless. Thank you..."
Said Whitney

Lyoop nods, then walks over behind the rocks as he takes a small tin out of a pocket of his leather shirt.

Whitney G. Elieen makes sure he is well outside the limits of her sight before she begins to undress...

Whitney G. Elieen folds her clothing neatly on a pile, leaving her things alongside it before walking into

the warm waters

A small plume of smoke emerges from behind the rocks. It is difficult to see the gray of

the tobacco smoke against the white steam coming from the spring.

The water is hot, but nor uncomfortably so. It teases the tension out of your body and leaves only a warm

fuzziness behind. It would be easy to spend hours, days, weeks here.

Large as she was, she found herself sinking as low as she could go in the warm, comfortable

waters of the spring...how long had it been since she found such respite? Her body relaxed. Her eyes closed. For

once she opted to simply enjoy the moment. A reminder that not all in this world was corrupt and horrific...

Whitney G. Elieen:

(Can ze spectators see now?)

(Ye)Crystal Saint Claire:

Laying back in the spring and floating amidst the soft current of water is relaxing.

easy to...

"Hey."
Said Lyoop

"You awake over there?"

out. Stretching her arms out above her body.

Whitney G. Elieen:

"I am now at least..."

"Need to go soon."
Said Lyoop

"Best not to fall asleep here."

"Lose time."

Whitney G. Elieen says in a relaxed tone

"You are right...yes. One moment..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen gets herself up

Whitney G. Elieen goes over to her clothes pile

"...I am sorry to disturb you but my clothing is still wet..."
Said Whitney

"I would ask you if you had another dress but..."

Whitney G. Elieen frowns

"No, should be fine. Warm up on the way."
Said Lyoop

"Right..."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen slowly places the considerably less pleasant clothes back onto her body. Piece after

piece until she was fully clothed and suddenly much more eager to go.

Whitney G. Elieen sighs

"Thank you very much."
Said Whitney

Lyoop steps out from behind the rock. There are several hand rolled cigarette buts lying on the ground,

and plenty of ashes. How long were you in there?

"I appreciate it very much..."
Said Whitney

"Welcome."
Said Lyoop

"And I am not very sure."
Said Whitney

"Maybe too long"

"I lost track of time..."

Lyoop looks at you with an odd expression for a moment. Then he turns and walks back into the forest,

motioning for Whitney to follow. Why should she go though? Her clothes are still wet, best to stay at the

hotsprings. The old Indian is a fool to leave.

"...I am sorry. I do not mean to impose but...do you think I can stay for a little bit longer? My

clothes are still very uncomfortable...I fear I will catch my death if I go now."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"They will dry up soon I am sure."

Lyoop walks back into the clearing and grabs Whitney by the arm. His face is flat and serious.

"Leave, now."
Said Lyoop

"Is..is something wrong?"
Said She

"Please be careful..."

"Been here too long."
Said Lyoop

"Need to leave."

"Not a place meant to stay."

"It won't be forever! Perhaps you could even send some of my friends here to get me? I mean

I don't want to impose on you if you have business...and I know a few of the others would enjoy a soak."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"The poor things must be so tired."

Lyoop looks at Whitney for a long few seconds. Then he physically drags her back into the forest with

him. Whitney can feel something poking into her arm as he does.

"O..ow!"
Said Whitney

Do you resist Whitney?Lyoop:

Whitney G. Elieen drags her arm back as she follows along

she does inspect her arm after thatWhitney G. Elieen:

Lyoop lets of her once they are both back into the forest. The opening in the brush where the Spring was

is nowhere to be seen. It is too dark to see, but running your fingers over your arm tells you that your

shirt is torn in five places. You can feel something warm in those spots.

"Time to go."
Said Lyoop

"Friends waiting."

Is Lyoop a werewolf? That's dope as hell(From Crystal Saint Claire):

"..."
Said Whitney

He might be.(To Poage):

Or he might be something else.(To Poage):

Whitney G. Elieen looks at her arms more closely. Feeling at the warm spots of her now torn up shirt. Was

that from falling into the brook, or...

"Why are you so eager to go? What is it that you are afraid of...?"
Said Whitney

"Not good to stay here."
Said Lyoop

"At the spring."

"Or here."

"In between."

"Why? What is wrong?"
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen asks as she runs her hands down her arm

"What was that poking into my arm?"
Said Whitney

"Must have been my fingernails."
Said Lyoop

"Get long."

"Living out in wild."

Lyoop starts walking further into the forest again. He checks back every few steps to make sure Whitney

is there.

Whitney G. Elieen follows along close behind him. Uncertain of what is going on or even the intentions of

this stranger...this was in God's hands now. Surely she would deliver her through whatever danger this

place posed.

"Right..."
Said Whitney

Lyoop continues through the forest with Whitney behind him. He moves swift through the foliage. He

brushes his right hand against his shirt a few times. Small stones begin to appear underfoot. Is he,

brushing his lips with his right hand? The stones develop into something resembling a path, they are

covered in moss. Lyoop steps through the brush into the light again. He holds the hole open for Whitney.

fountain with a statue standing in it.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is snoozing lightly next to the fountain

drank from the water.

Crystal Saint Claire is asleep, snuggled up in a blanket on a haybale. She only needed one hay bale to

sleep on.

It is a bedroll and a pillow.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano hasn't moved for hours.

"mrrh... G'mornin'..."
Said Crystal

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has his rifle in as tight of a grip as his dozing self can manage

Crystal Saint Claire blearily wipes sleep from her eyes.

(One momentO)Whitney G. Elieen:

"Morning little one."
Said Sigyn

"Your friends are still asleep, try not to wake them."

"Oh! Good morning Miss Sigyn..."
Said Crystal

"I asked the others to be quiet as they could."
Said Sigyn

Crystal Saint Claire whispers to her.

"I will try to avoid waking them."
Said Crystal

"Do you know where I could find something to eat?"

"...thank you very much." She says, looking at the sleepy little town with a curious raise of her

brow. Turning to him with a smile and a bow of her head.

Whitney G. Elieen:

"God bless you for your hospitality and your guidance."

"Of course, we've got the meat for today spitted and roasting."
Said Sigyn

"I'll carve you some."

"Thank you..."
Said Crystal

Lyoop bows to Whitney. then walks back into the forest.

"Be waiting for when you want to come back."
Said Lyoop

"Be safe."

Crystal Saint Claire walks over to the roasting boar.

Crystal Saint Claire sleepily stretches, yawning a squeaky yawn, and turns to see if the sun is up yet.

Sigyn picks up the sword laying next to the fire pit and slices off a leg for Crystal.

Whitney G. Elieen steps forward, step after heavy step...

"Hod, mead and a plate?"
Said Sigyn

"That is a lot of meat... I am unsure I will finish it all."
Said Crystal

"...Nephi?"
Said Whitney

Hod wordlessly takes a mug of mead from under the flowing spigot and holds out a plate to Sigyn. The

woman slaps the leg onto, takes the plate and the mead, then gives it to Crystal.

"Here."
Said Sigyn

"Thank you. May I eat outside?"
Said Crystal

"You may eat wherever you wish."
Said Sigyn

"It is a beautiful morning."
Said Crystal

"Only, bring back the dishes..."
Said Sigyn

"Yes ma'am!"
Said Crystal

Sigyn peters off as Crystal runs outside.

Crystal Saint Claire peeks back through the door. "To you, or to Mr. Hod? Where do the dishes go?"

"I apologize, I ran off..."
Said Crystal

"...Mmnmh.":Nephi "
Said Longiron

"Just leave them by the mead casks."
Said Sigyn

Nephi "Longiron" Delano lifts his hat up

"...Whitney?"
Said Nephi

"Oh good gracious, Whitney!"

Nephi "Longiron" Delano jumps up and, without even really realizing what he was doing, hugs her

Sigyn leans against the stones of the fire pit.

Hod rubs at his filmy eyes with a distracted hand.

"Yes ma'am!"
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire toddles off

"Yes! Yes so good to see you again..."
Said Whitney

"Whitney we gotta get outta here."
Said Nephi

Crystal Saint Claire sets her lunch down next to the fountain. She's still a bit groggy, and half-blind, so

she doesn't notice Whitney... until she speaks.

"Whitney!!"
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen smiles at him...and her smile grows all the wider as Crystal walks into the scene!

"Something really weird's going on around-"
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is still hugging

Whitney G. Elieen reaches her arms out!

Crystal Saint Claire almost TACKLES Whitney.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano realizes this and coughs, backing up

Whitney G. Elieen engulfs Crystal in a hug. Picking the much smaller woman up

Crystal Saint Claire hugs Whitney as tight as she can. Which... still isn't very tight.

"God be praised that I may see you again!"
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen says as she sets Crystal down

"...Er."
Said Nephi

"When y'all two are finished."

"How worried I was...sorry. I may have come sooner had it not been for falling into the river."
Said Whitney

"There's funny business goin on around here."
Said Nephi

Whitney G. Elieen turns her head over to Nephi

Crystal Saint Claire is still hugging onto Whitney's leg.

"Now what mean you by "Funny business" She says, still holding Crystal close to herselfWhitney G. Elieen:

She's sort of babbling half to herself, half to Whitney the whole time.Crystal Saint Claire:

"Somethin real WEIRD. This place is wrong."
Said Nephi

"Cassie knew more, but I think she's..."

"We went through the woods and it was dark and scary and I almost got lost and Lyoop has

a nice name and Miss Sigyn gave me some food and a place to sleep but it's meat so you can't eat it but I bet they

have something for you and if they don't I have some trail rations you can have"

Crystal Saint Claire:

"...Ah dunno. I was..."
Said Nephi

Crystal.

There's some red on your dress that was not there before you hugged Whitney.

"..."
Said Crystal

Crystal Saint Claire immediately gets serious.

"You are injured. Show me."
Said Crystal

"We're gettin out of here soon as we find the red-handed man."
Said Nephi

"...one at a time."
Said She

"I think I must have scratched it when i fell..."

Can I roll Medicine?Crystal Saint Claire:

Yes.

Wow the dice are cursed today.

You take Whitney's left arm and examine it. There are five neat puncture wounds

there. Each one is leaking a little blood, but not much. You should get these disinfected and put a bandage on.

"Does anyone have some alcohol? Something stronger than mead would be preferable...

Or... garlic, garlic might make a suitible antiseptic..."

Crystal Saint Claire:

Crystal Saint Claire attempts to lead Whitney to the dining hall.

"...I do. If cider can be counted as such..."
Said Whitney

Crystal Saint Claire takes her cup of mead.

"Cider is insufficient. Something like whiskey."
Said Crystal

"Follow us nephi. There is much we must discuss of this place"
Said Whitney

Crystal Saint Claire picks up her plate.

"Miss Sigyn do you have any garlic?"
Said Crystal

"Whitney is hurt..."

"Ye-."
Said Sigyn

Whitney G. Elieen enters the building with a great big thunk

"Oh, I should have something for that."
Said Sigyn

Crystal Saint Claire takes a bite of meat and chews a little.

"Hello" She says, bowing her head.Whitney G. Elieen:

Sigyn digs around in the table in front of the mead casks.

"I am Whitney Elieen. I was led here by your friend..."
Said Whitney

"We need to clean the wound out, and dress it. Something that will not get infiected would

be good, a poultice of some sort."

Crystal Saint Claire:

"Greetings."
Said Hod

"Best for puncture wounds."Crystal Saint Claire:0

"Yes."
Said Whitney

"..."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano places a single hand on Whitney's shoulder. With effort.

"The native."
Said Whitney

Nephi "Longiron" Delano makes a face

"I heard someone was hurt?"
Said Kyri

"Yes...a simple injury"
Said Whitney

"I must have sustained it when i fell into the brook"

Whitney G. Elieen says as she holds her arm out

Sigyn bumps her head on the table as she emerges.

"Oh, Kyri, thank you."
Said Sigyn

"The blond haired woman."

Kyri nods and walks over to Whitney. She takes the injured arm and looks at it for a moment.

"...and is there something you need Nephi?" She says, turning her head to look at the much

smaller man attempting to put his hand on her shoulder

Whitney G. Elieen:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has to stand on tiptoes to manage it

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has a worried expression, but... Eventually sighs and pinches his nose

Hod scratches his chin for a while. He shrugs, and continues to set up mugs on the mead table.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano eventually wanders away to stand with his back to the wall

Kyri takes a strip of white cloth and a small bottle from a bag at her side. She uncorks the bottle and

pours it over Whitney's arm. The liquid stings for a moment. The red haired woman is winding the strip of

cloth around Whitney's arm in an eyeblink..

"This should keep you."
Said Kyri

"Are you a doctor too?"
Said Crystal

"What ho friend, I have not seen you in this fine hall before."
Said Honir

"What do you think of the mead?"

"I ease pain."
Said Kyri

Crystal Saint Claire sips at the mead.

"I would not call myself a doctor."
Said Kyri

"So you are a medic."
Said Crystal

"Thank you very much."
Said She

"God bless you and the work you do."

"...thank you."
Said Crystal

Whitney G. Elieen clasps the hand of her afflicted arm...

Crystal Saint Claire goes back to holding on to Whitney's leg.

Kyri nods to Whitney and Crystal. Then walks back over to her spot at the far left table.

"A fine community it seems you have here..."
Said Whitney

"We are few, but we do get by."
Said Sigyn

"Mmmm..."
Said Hod

"There are many nordic communities here...few seem to follow in the old style though."
Said Whitney

"I am sorry to trouble you further...but I am both terribly thirsty and a bit hungry. Have you any fruits or

"Our friend that kept the apple orchard has fallen to time, but I have kept up her duties."
Said Hod

Hod reaches under the counter and produces a box. He opens it to reveal it is full of apples.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is standing with one foot against the wall, arms crossed, eyes darting back and

forth every few minutes. Especially because there were more people here before his, ah... ""Watch""

than before*Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Perfect"
Said She

"Not talkative I suppose..."
Said Honir

"I do not have much but i can spare some payment for your genorisity"
Said Whitney

"It is appreciated, but not necessary. The feasting hall is open to any who come."
Said Hod

Whitney G. Elieen bows her head and reaches for an apple. "Thank you again...before i leave i hope to

return your kindess."

"Thank you Miss...?"
Said Sigyn

"Whitney Elieen."
Said Whitney

"A beautiful name."
Said Sigyn

"I am Sigyn."

"The man with the box of apples is called Hod."

(I gtg, sorry)Crystal Saint Claire:

"The man over to the right is called Honir."
Said Sigyn

(See you later!~)Whitney G. Elieen:

"And you have met Kyri."
Said Sigyn

"The one sitting with her is called Tyr."

"I see...it is a pleasure to meet you Sigyn. Hod. You have a lovely home here...what of the

one in the woods?"

Whitney G. Elieen:

"The native?"

"Do you know him?"

"He showed me the way when I was lost."

"I'm afraid I do not know."
Said Hod

"Could you describe him?"

"Hhmmm...he seemed to have picked up a smoking habit..."
Said She

"He smoked several cigarettes during our time...not a very clean habit but I am not one to judge."

"...his nails were also long apparently."

"Sigyn...?"
Said Hod

"I don't know."
Said Sigyn

"Perhaps if Odin were here, but he has been gone for many winters."

"Odin...?"
Said Whitney

"Was this the one who tended to the orchids?"

"No, he was the wisest among us."
Said Sigyn

"He kept our knowledge."

how much norse mythology would witty know(From Whitney G. Elieen):

"I see...where did he go to?"
Said Whitney

You the one with the character, tell me.(To Yuppie b.):

"A task befitting of the name."
Said Whitney

"At least what I know of the theology of the nordic people...a student of history?"

"Where might he have gone do you think?" She says with a frown. "It is always a hard

thing...to leave home that is."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"We do not know."
Said Sigyn

"One day, he was simply gone."

"At first we believed he would be back."

"It is not the first time he has left on a sudden trip."

"How long ago was this?"
Said Whitney

"I am very sorry to hear this...where did he go on these sudden trips? Did he ever say?"

"It was...long ago."
Said Hod

"I cannot recall, it must have been...at least a decade."

"Perhaps more."

"He has gone on most trips to find dear friends of ours who have fallen to the ill will of others."

"...I see. Quests of discovery and recovery...he sounds like a noble soul."
Said Whitney

"Only God might know where he is at this point. And she never tells easily...he is in my prayers. Wherever he

might be. As you are all in mine."

"This place is...I can't quite put my finger on it...there is a peace here, though maybe it is my time in the spring that

makes me say so."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano is still standing by the wall. Quietly listening in.

"We try to keep this place as it has always been."
Said Sigyn

"A place to rest and recover."

"And so it has been." She says with a smile. "Though speaking of rest...I feel I must sit for a

Whitney G. Elieen:

"Perhaps enjoy this apple you have kindly offered to me."

"Go ahead."
Said Sigyn

"Enjoy our hospitality, as we enjoy having you."

Whitney G. Elieen bows her head and smiles

"Thank you...and God bless."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen walks towards Nephi, with Crystal in tow

"Shall we dine outside then?"
Said Whitney

"...Yeah."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano looks at every one of the fellows he could see and, ultimately, doesn't see

anything worth starting a fuss over.

"Nice day for a picnic anyways."
Said Nephi

"Of course."
Said Sigyn

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has to step around Whitney, unable to get to the door because of her prodicious

"Come back if you need anything."
Said Hod

Nephi "Longiron" Delano heads out to the fountain, and turns to Whitney.

"So."
Said Nephi

Whitney G. Elieen nods once before walking out.

"...yes Nephi?"
Said Whitney

"...You're not feeling bothered?"
Said Nephi

"Everything here's... Too nice."

"Way too nice."

"Even the nice bits of Salt Lake ain't like this."

Whitney G. Elieen clenches her injured arm

"S'just..."
Said Nephi

"The strangeness is not lost on me, I assure you."
Said Whitney

"Am I insane for thinkin it's all just wrong somehow?"
Said Nephi

"Any normal folk come here they'd probably be goin on about how wonderful everyone is."

"...I just get scared."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano slumps down by the fountain's base.

Nephi "Longiron" Delano has a bite from some bread from his rations.

"My experience in the woods has me worried as well...but I trust you are basing this off more

than just a strange feeling?"

Whitney G. Elieen:

Whitney G. Elieen said as she takes a bite of her apple

"What Cassie said."
Said Nephi

"This place shouldn't be here."

"Especially this statue because it used to be on the east coast or somethin like that."

"There's some kinda powerful mojo goin on around here."

"Alex'd probably know more but he's been practicin his devil magic or whatever he does for a while now."

"Look at that statue, Whitney."

"Looks like it's been here bout a hunderd years, yeah?"
Said Nephi

"...hmmm...I may talk with Alex myself soon enough."
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen looks to the statue

"Either this place is older than the Union or there's somethin mighty strange goin

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"These lands have been here far longer then any kingdom of man..."
Said Whitney

"...who is to say what is true or not? The native who led me here..."

"Are you familar with him?"

"Whitney. We're in what was once Indian lands."
Said Nephi

"Ain't no way something like this could be here."

"Which is why it bothers me that it is so much."

"The native?"
Said Whitney

Whitney G. Elieen says with another bite of her apple

"Did you know him?"
Said Whitney

"No."
Said Nephi

"The one with the long finger nails."
Said Whitney

"Someone told Alex about him.?Nephi "
Said Longiron

"Who told Alex about him?"
Said Whitney

"What did he have to say?"

"I think it's whatever dark power Alex dealt with."
Said Nephi

"He's in debt to the same thing Alex is."

Whitney G. Elieen nods her head."

"...I see."
Said Whitney

"I will need to speak with Alex...and the demon."

"I don't think any demon would exactly be willin to talk to a man o'god... Or, eh,

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"If there is one thing demons love to do."
Said Whitney

"It is to talk"

"Besides. We have met before remember?"

"And to try to lead us astray, yeah."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano nibbles on more bread.

Whitney G. Elieen sighs before taking a bite of her apple

"The native said if i wished to return to the spring that he would be back..."
Said Whitney

"...I'm here for ya, Whitney. If you need my gun or another man of faith, y'know?"
Said Nephi

"I will await his arrival again." She said, smiling softly at him.Whitney G. Elieen:

"And thank you very much Nephi."

"This has been a...trying time for me. For us all..."

"But through God we can find strength."

"Heh. Where's all the Son of Joseph business you usually go with~?"
Said Nephi

"Even in the face of darkness."
Said Whitney

Nephi "Longiron" Delano offers her an unbitten slice of bread

Whitney G. Elieen takes it with a smile. "It has been a long journey here...and besides. Son of Joseph or

not...we are all children of God."

"Your teacher is not my teacher but the gift is universal."
Said Whitney

"We sure are."
Said Nephi

Whitney G. Elieen bites into it.

"Aw, shucks, I ain't never had the gift."
Said Nephi

"I've seen what the prophets and the Twelve can do."

"Nobody in my family's got it."

"Cept maybe my ma."

"They say every man with the priesthood can call down the power of the angels, but... Only a few of em can do it

on the regular, y'know?"

"We are all offered salvation, and so we all have the gift. That is the grandest miracle of

all...all else springs from the same fountain."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"It is hard to say why God does what she does...and selects who she does. But there is power to the word and to

faith. A real power...for the longest time only the greats of ancient times could be said to do what I can also do."

Whitney G. Elieen says as she produces her holy mug

Whitney G. Elieen drains the top a little before sipping

"I take it a sign that the second coming approaches...soon."
Said Whitney

"Miracles..."
Said Nephi

"...Yer an adventist, right?"

Whitney G. Elieen hands the mug over to him

"Yes."
Said Whitney

Nephi "Longiron" Delano takes a little sip.

"Didn't they have that whole kerfuffle a while back?"
Said Nephi

"Are you refering to the great dissapointment?"
Said Whitney

"Yeah."
Said Nephi

"...Mostly I remember my bishop laughin bout it. Seemed kinda mean."

"He wasn't the nicest fella. Er, not to talk bad bout the lord's servants."

"That is correct, yes. Miller falsly believed in his divine mathmatics. Our family was hit hard by

this...but from disappointment and failure can come greater faith and understanding"

Whitney G. Elieen:

"and it is fine"

"My father was not all that nice either."

Whitney G. Elieen said with another sigh. "For a man of God that is."

"Yeah. I remember hearin bout that. My condolences."
Said Nephi

"But hey, we ever end up in Junkyard, yer comin for dinner."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano says matter-of-factly.

"My folks love meetin my friends, after all."
Said Nephi

"Ma's cookin is to diiie for, mmh."

Whitney G. Elieen smiles yet again after a brief moment of melencholic silence.

"I would like this very much Nephi."
Said Whitney

"I always enjoyed meeting others."

"Alma and Lehi would love to meet you too."
Said Nephi

"I just hope Helaman hasn't come back home."

"...He's more Rockett's speed."

"If you understand what I'm saying."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano frowns.

"I see..."
Said Whitney

a kid doesn't have a good time with their folks.":

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

Nephi "Longiron" Delano gives Whitney her water back.

It was not water, but cider! Cold and crisp it seemed from the small sip you took.Whitney G. Elieen:

Ooh.Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"It was just the one. The great disappointment turned him cruel and harsh. He blamed himself

and his family for his perceived damnation. It has been a long time..." She says in a distant tone. "They are in

heaven now. All but two of us. My mission calls me to rise above the scars of the past."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"To heal others and lead them above. That is my mission. Wounds of the past will remain there and will eventually

be wiped clean by the grace of God."

"Well, you've been doing a good job of it so far."
Said Nephi

"It is not enough. I pray God will grant me the power to do more soon. To fend off evil and to

heal the sick. Of body and mind."

Whitney G. Elieen:

"All you have seen comes from her. And it is only the begining."

Whitney G. Elieen sighs again as she takes a bite of her apple

"I just hope to be a worthy vessle. Now especially as we face darker powers..."
Said Whitney

"Yeah."
Said Nephi

"Haven't really started tusslin with the real bad ones just yet."

"They're out there, though. I seen one of them."

"One of them?"
Said Whitney

"Who did you see?"

"I call him the Ivory Rider."
Said Nephi

"He... Probably killed all mah friends."

"..."
Said Whitney

Nephi "Longiron" Delano falls quiet, and dark.

Whitney G. Elieen goes stiff...ridged

"Tall? White?"
Said Whitney

Nephi "Longiron" Delano grips his rifle tight enough for his hand to go pale and start leaving a mark in the

"That's the one."
Said Nephi

"I'm not common to all these stories of vampires and whorewolves and gribbly-gnawies."

"...But he's probably The Adversary's right-hand man."

"I told you bout my... Old friends, right?"

"Used to have another posse I traveled with."

"...you mentioned them before I believe..."
Said Whitney

"One was a doctor from engaland. A priest from some parts of the east of Europe.

Some two-bit drifter, a union soldier, and..."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"Heh. "Mister Alexander Hardin, No Relation". Always made me laugh a bit when he said that."

"We were all lookin for a treasure buried out in Kansas when it... Happened."

"He showed up. Everything went dark. I heard screams."

"I ran for my life."

"Ran and ran the whole night through."

"...When the mornin came around, I found my way back to the campsite."
Said Nephi

"...Blood on the ground."

"Never found no bodies."

"..."
Said Whitney

"It seems wherever he goes...he brings horror in his wake..."

"If anyone survived, it was probably Hardin."
Said Nephi

"Old man took a shotgun blast to the chest and walked it off the next day."

"...But he showed up again, just before we left Dodge."

"I mentioned it."

"He carved somethin into my pop's rifle too."

"...what did he carve?"
Said Whitney

Nephi "Longiron" Delano moves his hand, showing it

(Can't remember at the moment, help me out Doc)Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

"...hmmmm..."
Said Whitney

"I see..."

(It was before christmas man cut me some slack)Nephi "Longiron" Delano:

(I was talking about details from the last couple of sessions that you done got

(Never backsass the GM.)

"I'm the only one that gets to carve stuff in my gun..."

Nephi "Longiron" Delano grumbles a bit about it

"..."
Said Whitney

"I am so very sorry Nephi..."

"Yeah..."
Said Nephi

"I am sorry you had to endure such an insult..."
Said Whitney

"I'll get him back for it. Someday."
Said Nephi

"Demon or not. I'll put him in the ground."

"Hmm. You want to wait out here til the others get back or wake up or what have you?"

(I'm heading off for the night.)

"I think...I am going to wait for the native to return..."
Said Whitney

"If he serves the one Alex serves, then i must speak with him."

"Yeah. I'm gonna go back to... Er. Keepin watch, yeah."
Said Nephi

Nephi "Longiron" Delano pulls his hat down over his eyes
