# Chapter 1

"The information will be released in half an hour. You have until that time to transfer a third of the assets controlled by avenue Q. You do not need to know routing numbers. You do not need to know who we are. All you need to do is remove firewall protections for the following TCP ICP route. Leave it down for five minutes. We will take this, and only this, as your agreement to the deal. Any other actions will be taken as refusal of the deal."

The stallion sitting in the chair is shaking by this point. His face is flushed. His eyes are wide. Searching all over the room for something. Anything to take him out of this. Eyes rove over the paintings in his penthouse office. One covers a safe. The other covers a small armory. This is despite the fact that he has bodyguards protecting him at all times. At first, I believed it was because he didn't trust them. Now, now I know that it's because they provide a certain theater for him. At least, that's what I think. Zigzag is a difficult stallion to figure out. Though I only needed to dig so deep into him to be a secretary. Someone afforded just enough access to be useful. Both to him, and to my team on the outside. I may not have been able to use the info I collected to do anything, but they could.
"Crow?"

I look over to him. My eyes focus. My mask of worried concern solidifies a little more now that he's called my name. He knows that I was listening. He knows I can find the implication of how much this bothers him in the tone of his voice. The light sweat budding on his brow. 

I don't know what the images were over the audio, but it's enough that he believes there's evidence. Enough that he believes that isn't all the evidence that he just saw. His mind already working at a furious pace to consider how much these people could know. How much they could have. No good answers.

"Yes, Mister Zigzag?"

The voice seems natural to me at this point. It's the voice that Zigzag hears every day. The voice that Crow's friends have heard since she moved here five years ago. The same voice her parents hear on the nightly calls. It's a little strange that the same person hasn't been talking to them for two of those years. 

"Can we get a trace on that connection?"

"Yes sir."
It takes only two clicks to bring up the tech department. I send them the request. The air in the office is tight. The tension sharp in both our chests as we wait for the answer. Though what we hope for is different. 

The reply shows up. I push it to Zigzag's monitor. 

The address and all identifying features mark it as coming from a building in the district just off the boardwalk. Where the street markets are.

Zigzag switches his attention to the phone. He orders a squad of plainclothes Q operatives in the area to check the building. 

Another few minutes pass. I work on things with the tech boys. Forwarding them info they're asking for. A few words pass my lips as I do that. Telling Zigzag what he needs to know. They don't get much further by the time the field crew checks back in. They found the connection, and the device that was used to relay the message. I see a picture of it as Zigzag does. The crew sends it to all those that are currently marked as working on the issue. 

A cheap laptop. Chunky. A single message, not being displayed by the screen, but scrawled over it. 

"Tut, tut. Not that easy. :D"

Zigzag smashes a hole into his desk with one hoof. I jump. Not because I don't expect it. He's a violent stallion. I jump because it's what Crow would do. It's been at the forefront of my mind so much. What she would do. It's sometimes hard, in the night, when I'm not playing a part, to remember what I would do.
That's when the text appears on the screen. It starts to scroll down. Times, places, descriptions of video footage that shouldn't exist anymore. Witnesses that are supposed to be dead. Each of them coming with one thing blacked out at the end. There are two parts that aren't blacked out. A comma. Two small circles. Degree symbols. Enough for someone to put together that those are coordinates. If even a tenth of those are still out there. It means very, very bad news for the avenue. 

Zigzag is distracted enough by the list to not notice the ticking of the time. He looks up when there are ten minutes left before the leak happens. I can hear his teeth grit from across the room. It doesn't sound like I feel it should. It sounds just enough like popcorn to feel familiar, but unlike enough to make it feel wrong. Sickening. 

I get five pings from the tech department asking what they should do. That the text is scrolling down over every company computer. 

Zigzag doesn't ask me to do anything. I assume that, if he's going to capitulate, he wants to make sure as few people are involved in it as is possible. I hear him almost beating the keys of his computer to send the message. 

Then he sits in his chair. He watches the door. His eyes are wide. His pupils small. His face making small contractions. Moving a lip to the side here. Snout twitching there. Subtle indications of something boiling under the surface.
He sends me home shortly after that. After that day, all of us know we're being monitored. Every single person that's had any access to the things implied in that information leak. It's a week and a half after that I actually get exfil. Zigzag, by that point, has been calling in employee after employee for an interview. Most of them leave it in one piece. Some don't. Some that leave end up disappearing in the days after the interview. I have no contact with my outside team at this point. It feels lonely. It's at night, when I'm wondering whether I will actually get exfil, that it happens. A light in a building opposite Crow's apartment. It flashes once. Three seconds pass. It flashes again. Two seconds. Flash. I don't get up immediately after that. I take some time. I keep staring out the window. Then I get up. I open the nightstand and take out the cigarette pack. The lighter. I pull on clothes over my pajamas. Out to the balcony. I light the cigarette. I put it to my lips. I take a pull. The cherry lights up in front of my face. Two drags. Smoke pouring over the balcony. The cigarette mostly out. Still held between my lips. Enough that it burns the edges of my muzzle. The slight rush of air. The feeling of the concrete edge scraping them. The view of the city underneath. Rendered small. People down there looking like ants. I suck in a deep breath.
I jump.

I fall. 

The cigarette is carried away from me by the air currents. 

It floats away. One red mote in a sea of blues and blacks in the night. 

I don't know if it will actually happen. 

I keep my face turned up as I hurtle down towards the street. I want to watch the moon. 

My heart beats so fast. It feels like someone is giving me chest compressions with a jackhammer. 

There's a sudden punch from the side. I stop falling down. I start falling to the side. Then, gradually, I stop falling at all. I travel through the night with someone holding me tight. The air is cold. Though I can't feel it quite right. It's as if it's from a distance. Getting info on my body through a telegraph connection. Just dots and dashes of things. The warmth of someone against me. The whips of my hair around my face. The slight burn on my lips from the cigarette. 

I let go of things for a little while. I don't need to think about all of this. My body goes limp. Weight I'd been carrying for so long drops away. 

"Chel?"

The name startles me out of my reverie. 

"Chel are you okay?"

I cough. I don't know when it happened, but I'm laying down, looking up at a concerned face above me. Half hidden by goggles. I remember her name after a few moments. 

"Yeah."

I raise a hoof. Black, with holes running through it. It takes me a second of looking at it with a confused expression to realize that's my hoof. The way it's supposed to be. 

"They got Deb."

It takes me a minute to process. I feel a rush of hot blame run through me. Could I have done anything? Did I miss a step somewhere down the line? I push it down. It doesn't matter. 

"Alive?"

"Yeah."

I push myself up. A rush of energy that I was sure wouldn't be there for weeks. Maybe months, comes back. I can't stay down. Can't rest. Not now. 

"Who am I?"

Grauss passes me a packet. 

"Penni."

I take the package. I glance at the photo. I nod. The green flames are already brushing over me. 

Back to the double life.
# Chapter 2

I rouse myself out of bed. I reach over to the nightstand to check my phone. It's around ten in the morning on a Sunday. I can smell eggs, bacon, and coffee downstairs. It's a few minutes of sitting there and looking at the time before I actually hit the point where I wanna do stuff. Well, not where I wanna. Where I can move myself around again. Not just exist in that half asleep space. 

My hooves hit the floor and I head over to the closet. I pull out my frilly, fluffy, pink robe. It's a bit big on me, but I like it that way. It feels like wearing an entire bed around me. I put on my matching pink, fuzzy slippers. My phone tucks neat and tidy into the right robe pocket. I start heading downstairs after that. The smell of breakfast is all over the house by now. It's one of the best things about Sunday. Getting to indulge a little with food. Junk food. Real food is always good and all, but getting some of the...I dunno. The taste. The texture. Not just the feeling and the fullness. That scratches an itch that all of us have. I've never met a drone that didn't want at least some junk food every now and then. 

Down the stairs, around the corner. There's a long table in the dining room. Drones trot around. Drones sit down at the table. Drones carry things back and forth. At the stove are two of them. One wearing a big pair of round glasses and a chef's hat that's almost as tall as she is. The other wearing the same chef's hat actually looks like he should be wearing it. 

"Morning Lexi. Morning dad."

"Morning sugarbug."

Lexi doesn't say anything. She just turns and gives me a cheery wave with the spatula she's holding. Then she turns back to the stovetop. 

It's easy to find my seat at the table. Dad saves it for me. The seat next to the head of the table. I can see Nymph right across from me. Her head rests on top of her hooves. Eyes closed. Probably barely awake. I decide to let the more pleasant sound of a plate clacking in front of her with bacon and eggs on it wake her up. She looks good resting there. Breath going in and out of her chest, nice and easy. 

While I wait for bacon and eggs to be ready, one of the other drones slips up. I look down. A pair of big, blue compound eyes look up to me. One of the younger ones. Still getting used to responsibility. Still with a little grub fat around his cheeks. He pours me a cup of coffee from a carafe held in his magic. He sets it down in front of me and wiggles up a little closer to my chair. I reach out to pat him on the head. 

"Thanks Melano. I appreciate it."

He wags his head up and down with a grin plastered on his face. I watch him speed away to check that everyone else at the table has coffee. 

I look to my coffee. Then, I pull my phone from my robe pocket. I waggle my hoof over it in a pattern that has little to do with my mind and a lot to do with my muscle memory. It opens. I scroll through the recent texts. I can see a few from the rest of the crew. Deb is recovering well. There's a few jobs that have been posted that got pushed to me from Brigg's setup. I leave them on the notifications tab so I can look at them later. What else. There's a text from Gaddy about settling into her mom's place. She sent me a pic of her room. I hold up my phone and snap a quick pic of me, then of my dad and Lexi at the stove. I send both of them to her.

"Ooooo, who you texting?"

One of the other drones is looking over at me. I can tell from the earrings and the two blush dots that its Harmonia. She's twisting in her seat looking at me. Probably drank too much coffee already. 

"Just texting the guys."

"Sure, sure..."

She pauses for a minute. Her eyes half lidded. Then she blinks. Her head tilts. She puts her hooftip to her right cheek. 

"Wait, aren't most of your friends from your like, little college groupie thing, girls? Wouldn't you call them girls then? Not like...guys?"

"It doesn't sound right. It's more like...most of them are *guys* kind of girls."

"So pretty much all the girls are butch then?"

"...kinda."

"Okay, that makes sense."

"Mmm."

I look back down to my phone for long enough to see a new notification from Gaddy.

"But you're *totally* texting someone else aren't you?"

"I don't want *everyone* to know my personal business, Har."

"Would I tell everyone?"

She puts on the pouty face. 

"Yes. By tonight the entire hive would know and probably a decent chunk of the people in the city."

"Oooo, flattering me. My streaming audience isn't *that* big."

She snickers. One hoof goes over her mouth to cover it in a way that does a good job of *looking* demure, without being anything close to it. 

"Yet."

"I'm sure it'll get there."

"Thanks Chel, you know you're *always* welcome to come on again. I got some *super* good clips from that time we played Gloom Forest."

"Sure. I'll think about it."

A shadow falls over my shoulder. I look up to see dad, looking down at me.

"Finished cooking. How you doing sunshine?"

"I'm good dad, you?"

I can feel a little grin tugging at the sides of my lips. He knows how much that nickname gets to me.
