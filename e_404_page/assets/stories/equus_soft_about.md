# Equus Soft

## Our Goals

We seek to provide a wonderful and easily usable OS to creatures engaging in business and in recreation. Our systems, both those that run our OS and those that we design from scratch, are tailored to YOU! If you ever feel your needs are not being properly met, please contact our helpline system at www.equusSoft/answers.com

## Our Founder

Equus Soft, and its pioneering operating system, were founded by a collaboration between Timid Pastern and Volition Conduit. While Timid Pastern has gone on to pastures Elysian, Volition Conduit still heads Equus Soft, and works tirelessly to promote computing in all sectors of life for the benefit of the Equestrian people.
