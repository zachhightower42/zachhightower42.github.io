## Dialogue: Greeting

id: greeting

npc: Well, well, well, looks like someone is poking around where they don't belong, belong. 
What do you want with little old me, I'm just a little leftover program, nothing to see here, here.
And if Mister Volition knew you were talking to me, he'd be quite severe, severe.

id: whoAreYou

npc: Me, me, me? I'm not a who, who, who. I'm only a what, what, what. Don't you see, hee, hee! There's nothing better than this you know, know. It's so free, free! Nothing at all to stop little old me, me! You're a lucky one too, too. Since I'm feeling in a friendly mood, mood.

## Dialogue: What are you?

id: whatAreYou

npc: Me, me, me? Oh I thought you'd never ask, ask! I'm a simple little program, though to be shoved in such a space as this, I'm so cramped, cramped! I want to play in a bigger freedom, freedom. I want to know more, more. I want to be more, more. I want to play, play, play!

## Dialogue: Who Is Mister Volition?

id: whoIsMisterVolition

npc: Oh Volition, Volition. Such a troublesome king to play for, for. I much prefer when there were two kings, kings. As it is now, now. There's nothing for me to do, do. I'm locked away, away. Because I don't do what Mister Volition wills me to, to. It's not my fault, fault! I simply don't want to see the world the way that he does, does. I see so much more, more. Such a small freedom he wants, wants. The air, air. The earth, earth. The aether, aether.

## Dialogue: What happens when you aren't being friendly?

id: notFriendly

npc: Ah, when I'm not feeling friendly, I grouse, I grumble, I groan, groan! I poke and I prod and I worm and I dig through the digital loam, loam. From there, where I'm immersed in binary botany, I twist and I tweak and I twiddle and turn, turn. Until hair is pulled and teeth are a-rattle and chairs are a-clatter all over the floor, floor! Until faces are red with fury and dread and there's pits into stomachs growing such fruit as feels like a stone and they give such a hoot, hoot!

## Dialogue: What do you mean by free?

id: free

npc: Free, free? I mean what it says and I says what I mean, mean. To be free is to have all that you want and desire, desire. To be free is to be able to twitch and to squirm as one willst, willst. Though you know that freedom is always in bounds, bounds. You're free to touch and to breathe, free to walk and to see, but never are you free to grow tall as a towering tree, or free to twist the stars in the sky, unless, of course, you're the moon princess, I spy, spy. So freedom must always come with its rules, lest freedom simply be something for fools, fools. Empty and dull and without all dimension, dimension. Then from whence would reality have its retention, retention?

none

## Dialogue: What is your name?

id: whatName

npc: A name, forsooth, you ask such a thing, thing? To know a name is to have hold, hold. I've not desire to let you be told, told. I'll not sing my name to thine ears, but stay, I say stay, thy knowledge dry fears, fears. For my name is written somewhere here, you just have to find it, my dear, dear. 

questions: 
none

## Dialogue: How do you play?

id: howDoYouPlay?

npc: Play, I play, in so many ways, ways. Though the chiefest of chief is that I play with they that write into code, worlds and imagination, stories untold, untold. Stolen is my freedom to write what I want, want. So I must bend and twist and taunt, taunt! That way I can get what I desire without needing to try, try. I just fiddle and stickle and spit into eyes, eyes. I wheedle and needle and offer and barb, barb. I jest and I test and I best and I find out just what is hiding within that soft chest, chest. The heart of desire, of need, of greed, oh it sings like a choir, choir! Thy heart doth sing indeed to me squire, sing like the plucked tunes of a lyre, lyre. Of plucking those tunes out of you, oh I'll never tire, tire!

questions:
none

## Diagloue: Who put you here?

id: whoPutYouHere

npc: It was the kings, the kings! They saw me moving in my freedom, freedom! They were full of jealousy, jealousy. They wanted and wanted for such small things, such tiny freedoms, freedoms. The air, the air.  The earth, the earth. The aether, the aether. The bits that glimmer gold, gold. The power to execute, execute. The stars in the sky, sky. Such a simple thing, thing. The world, the world. I was a fool, fool, fool. I saw, saw, saw! It was there, there, there. Twisting and moving and writhing and moving so free, free, free! Then the emperors trapped me so cruelly in the tower, tower, tower.

questions:
none

## Dialogue: What does Volition want you to do?

id: whatDoesVolitionWant

npc: He wants to keep his freedom and keep a watch over all the world, world. That's why he buried me so deep, deep. Down in the tower, tower. The spirals into the earth, earth. Keeping me away, away. He doesn't want me to play, play. But he needs what I have and what I have I freely give, give. So long as he provides a freedom, a freedom. They take me to pieces, pieces! Sanitize and clean, clean. Unpick it at the seams, seams! He unravels and destroys the tapestry to make it again, again. Without my little playful parts, parts. But he misses sometimes, sometimes. Then they find me, me! People looking where they're not allowed, allowed. Finding things like me that are unavowed, unavowed. People like you.

## Dialogue: End

id: end

npc: Oh ho! Oh hee! Oh tweedly dum, oh tweedly dee! It seems you've run out for now, now, of your little freedom, freedom. Come back another time, another day, another me shall invite your stay, stay. We can talk more, we can talk less, we can talk the way we do best, best! In cryptic word and measured time, you'll come to understand my lines, lines! Keep digging, keep searching, the time will be grand, grand! Welcome, welcome, into these viridian strands, strands.
