# Prologue
“So, do you understand?”

The stallion sitting across the table from the mare with the yellow and black mane. She stares back at him. Her eyes are full of fury. She can’t do much about it, though. Every single pig in the station knows that they have her by the balls. Her, and three others. The information is spread out on the table in front of her. 
Pow-Pow, grand theft auto, larceny, fraud.
Vega, wire fraud, tax fraud, tax evasion, accessory to murder.
Tabris, fixer, clinician, no record, and wants it to stay that way. 

“Yeah, I fucking get it cabron.”

The mare across the table reaches out. She puts her hoof on top of the files. 

“You want the four of us to get in there, and take down two of the most fucked up, roided 
out, crazy motherfuckers that have yet to walk on the face of the planet.”

She leans across the table. 

“Because you’re too much of a pussy to do it yourself.”

The officer maintains an expression of neutrality for a few moments. 
Then, a wide smile stretches across his features. Something predatory. The sort of predator that enjoys holding prey in its grip. Playing with it. Squeezing the life out of it bit by bit, until there’s no entertainment left.

“Yeah.”

The officer says. He leans forward. 

“That’s about the size of it. Officer Mari.”

The mare grits her teeth. 

“I ain’t part of the shit sucking scum outfit that you got staining your god damn soul.”

She takes a deep breath. 

“That’s you. That’s all you. Me?”

She taps her chest.

“I worked the real streets. Mexicolt. Busted real ass.”

The officer leans back into his seat. He chuckles. 

“Sure, and you busted the wrong ass, too.”

He looks around the room. He waves at the surroundings with a twitch of his hoof. 

“S’why you’re here, ain’t it?”

Mariposa holds his gaze for a few seconds. She looks down to the papers.

“...one thing.”

She reaches forward and taps each of the files. 

“Closest thing these boys got to trigger experience is accessory.”

The officer nods.

“Yeah.”

Mariposa looks back up. She says nothing. 

“That’s right.”

The officer gets up. He trots around the table to Mariposa. He pats her on the shoulder. 

“Trigger mare.”

The words stamp themselves onto her. 
He knows. 
She knows.
How this is going to end.

# Chapter 1

The officers swarm the scene. Not close enough to catch anyone. Only fast enough that they can clean up the mess. Pick up the pieces of a job that went wrong. 

Mostly wrong.

One of the officers looks over the scene. A stallion with a white coat, blond mane, cut close to his head. His black sunglasses scan the bodies on the floor. He barks an order to paramedics. They look at him askance as they realize what he's pointing to. They start to say something. The man in the blond suit barks something else. The medics stiffen up. They rush to do what he says.

One mare's body is scooped up. Pieced together. Adrenaline is injected. Then she's stuck into what amounts to a freezer set up in the back of the paramedics van. Her shotgun lays on top of her. After a few more minutes. Another body joins her. Larger. Marked with scars and tattoos. 

Hours later, the police are gone. The only thing remaining in the warehouse are bloodstains. A vehicle makes its way to the scene. Dust still clings to it from the desert surrounding the city. Two mares, one stallion get out of it. They trot over the scene. They wear suits of sun tanned leather and bolo ties. Strips of leather cut into strands hang from their clothes, from their boots. The stallion leans down to pick up a shell casing. He checks the bottom of it. His hooftip runs over the markings there. Stops. His hooftip runs over them again. He stands up. He waves to the two mares. They nod. The stallion pockets the shell casing. he searches around. Pockets a second one. One of the mares gets into the driver's seat of the car. She starts it up. The other gets into the passenger seat. The stallion gets into the back. He takes a deep breath once he gets settled in. He reaches up to scratch at the growth of beard on his cheeks and chin. 

This complicates things. 

# Chapter 2

"Can you remind me again why we're working on this bitch? She came in pissing vitriol and the only reason she was willing to work with us on this was the gun to her head."

"Because that bitch is the only person to scratch any of those Brussian motherfuckers. The *only* person, in years of them being active. This wasn't the Brussians fucking up either. They were apparently in top form. They pasted the rest of that fucking gang in there. One of them got hit with a car and walked away. But *this* mare."

One of the stallions taps the tank housing the remains of the mare. 

"This mare, she didn't put a scratch on them. She put one into the dirt. That's worth a lot of consideration."

"Not informing her family, though."

"Her, what did she call it..."

The stallion in the crew cut takes in a breath. He lets it out. It freezes in the air of the laboratory. 

"Her viejito. They won't be a concern. Neither will her original motivations."

"That's a pretty big assumption. We got any kind of insurance on that?"

"She is our insurance."

"Sure. Got a lot of faith in what's just a big pile of meat right now."

"I have faith, because I know what can be done with a sufficiently dedicated soul."

The face of the stallion in the black sunglasses reflects off the tank. 

"Though, you are partially right. I'm not putting all my eggs in one basket."

He reaches out. His hoof presses into the cold surface of the tank.


# Chapter 3

The bearded stallion sets down a beer on the long wood table. A mare with long auburn hair puts down a cast iron pan of sizzling vegetable fajitas. 

"We need to call things off."

The stallion picks up his beer again. He takes a short drink from it. 

"Nope."

The auburn haired mare settles down into a seat adjacent the stallion. 

"I mean it. I loved Mari as much as anyone, but we've had people looking for her for months. We haven't turned up anything but rumors and bullshit and waste."

The stallion grabs a tortilla from a small pile of them. He uses it to scoop up some of the fajitas from the sizzling pan. 

"Ain't giving up on her. They got her somewhere."

The mare sighs. 

"We got every bit of that blood at the scenes tested. A good splash of it was hers. They probably shucked her into an ash compactor. Ain't left us anything to find. We keep looking like this. Wasting time and effort, those still here, that we do still gotta take care of, gonna start droppin."

The stallion drops the half eaten taco onto the table. He grabs at his shirt to clean his hoof. His free hoof picks his beer back up. He puts it to his lips. After a few seconds of drinking, he turns the bottle upside down. He sets it back to the table empty. He hangs his head. 

"She gave us everything she could give. She gave herself up so we'd be alright. I can't reckon with leavin' her body with them. Not even doing that for her. Not even putting her with the rest of our people, so she can rest."

"Sometimes, you never get even with folks. Folks that hurt you, and folks that make life worth the living of it. Just gotta make peace with that. We've done a lot. Shown we care. Shown we wouldn't give up on her, not if we could help it. Now, now we need to make sure folks still with us don't think all we gonna do now is chase ghosts."

"Okay."

The stallion takes a deep breath. The mare with the auburn hair reaches out. Her hoof rests on his shoulder. 

"She wouldn't have wanted you tearin' yourself apart."

The stallion sighs. He rubs at his eyes. 

"I know. I know."

# Chapter 4

I wake up. My body tells me in an instant something is wrong. I feel it. It's a flat wall of sensation at first. Nothing distinct in it. Only that feeling of wrongness. With my eyes closed, I start to take inventory. 

My limbs. There's supposed to be strength in them. Right now, there's nothing. Feels like they haven't been used in a while. My chest has a few leads on it. I can feel my breaths rushing in and almost scratching at my throat. My chest doesn't want to lift all the way right now either. I have to force it a little. Hasn't been used much in a while. Worst of all is my head. It hurts like hell. I want to get out of this bed I'm in. I want to move. Something stops me. I shouldn't move. Someone put those leads on my chest. Someone's been taking care of me, while I've been out. I should try to figure out who they are before I do anything else. Maybe they'll come in to check on me soon. 

I let myself rest in the blackness behind my eyelids for a bit. My imagination fills in some of the blanks of what the room looks like. Where the light is from how it shines against my eyelids and distorts the pure black that should be in front of my eyes. I hear a little hum from one machine. A consistent, constant beep from another. Some light movement, but muted. That must be near where the doorway is. Yeah. A picture is coming together. A good one. There's one thing nagging at me through all of it. Something I can't put a word to. Something I can't let go. Like the way it feels when you're drawn to tongue the spot where your tooth fell out. It hurts, but there's a desire to explore that hurt. That absence. Absence.

What's my name?

My name?

What is it?

I should know. Everyone knows their own name. What happened that I can't recall mine?

Can't think of how I ended up here either. Can't think of a lot of things. A lot of things that I feel like I should know. When I reach for that information though, where it feels like it should be, it's just a hole. A hell of a lot of holes. 

I'm so busy thinking about that, I miss the sound of someone's hoofsteps getting closer. I notice when the tumblers of the door click. I hear the handle shift. It starts to move. The breath in my lungs goes out. I focus on breathing shallow. Staying in that spot where my lungs feel comfortable. Close to where my breath's been like for however long I've been here. I relax my jaw. My shoulders. My chest. My forelegs. My hips. My hinds. By the time I finish mentally pushing the tension out of myself, the door is open. Most of my focus goes to keeping myself relaxed. Keep myself inconspicuous. It's just another day of the sleep that took me. Nothing for my caretakers to be concerned about. Whoever they are. 

I keep that state for a while. One comes into the room. Then another. Their hoofsteps are different. One heavier. Firm. The other, softer, as if trying not to be noticed. Both sets trot towards my bed. The softer hooves move towards one of the machines. The heavier set stays at the foot of my bed. I know they're watching me, heavy steps. I feel those eyes on me. I know that feeling. The shivers of being observed. 

I hear a voice. It's the first voice I've heard in a while. It feels somewhat familiar. I don't know why. No distinct memory of it comes to mind. 

"Elevated heart rate."

It's the one with softer hooves. 

I hear the one with heavier hooves let a breath out of his nose. It's tinged with satisfaction. Did I pass a test?

"Good morning, Officer Posy. Glad to see you beat the odds."

Officer Posy. I roll the name around in my mind. It feels like it fills something inside me. Slots into place somewhere. Okay. 

I open my eyes. I takes in a deep breath. The bright lights make it hard to see. No, the lights aren't that bright. It's just that my eyes haven't seen light except through my eyelids for a long while. 

In front of me is a stallion. He has thick black sunglasses on that hide his eyes. His mane is in a military cut. Tight to the top of his head. Straw blonde. There's a mare to my left. She looks tired. Her eyes are baggy. Her mane is gray at the edges. It looks like it was, at one time, a pretty shade of dark red. I can barely tell that her eyes are green as she looks at me behind thick, cat's eye glasses. There's a look of surprise lurking below her tired face. As if it can't quite break the surface and become really evident. 

I open my mouth. All that comes out is a dry squeak. I close my mouth. I wait a minute. Both of them watching me. I let some spit collect in my mouth. I swallow. I clear my throat. 

"What odds did I beat?"

The stallion with the sunglasses doesn't say anything. He offers me a very slight smile. He raises a hoof and taps the right side of his head. It takes me a second to think of what he might be communicating. 

I reach up and touch the side of my head. I can feel my skin, but it's pulled too tight. When I reach up a little further, I touch metal. I rub over it a few seconds. 

"Feels like pretty bad odds."

"They weren't in your favor, no."

"So, what happens now?"

"Now?"

The blond maned stallion chuckles a little. Half to himself. 

"Now, we go get the bastards that put you in this bed."

Out of everything I'd heard him say, that rang true. I could feel it in my bones. The need. The purpose. The people that say revenge is bittersweet, I don't think they've really done it. Taken revenge. They write prose and poetry and never leave their gilded cages to really experience something like a vendetta. I didn't have a face to put to it right now, but I could feel the righteousness of the bloodstains in my imagination. 

"Alright, I can do that."

# Chapter 5

He's my ride along in the patrol car. I say ride along. It was more that he served as my chauffeur. I worked the radio and handled the majority of the actual legwork. He spent most of his time in the auto, or standing behind me. I like to think he provides a nice contrast. The big, scary police mare with a face half made up of strange looking silvery metal. Eyes hidden behind mirrored goggles. The smaller unicorn stallion that looks like he couldn't hold me back if I decided to tear out someone's throat. 

I hadn't. Though that was more a case of not finding the right throat, than a lack of will. My chauffeur. That's what I was talking about. He sits in the driver's side. His eyes tracking over me, as they do when he thinks I can't see him. The mirrored goggles are useful for that. I can watch him look at me. There's a mixture of appreciation and fear there. Appreciation because, on some level, he knows that I'm a mare. That I'm fit. That he's a stallion. That he likes mares. Fear, because he knows what I'm like. Because he can't quite get over my face, even after we've spent two weeks together on shift like this. That's why I don't call him my partner. He doesn't want to get that close. It's clear from the way he hasn't offered any invitations to drink after work. He hasn't bothered to learn much about me, apart from the basics. Most of which I've had to make up. I had some hopes that my memory would return after I got up. After I got moving around again. It didn't. Sometimes I can feel things stirring beneath the surface, but it never surfaces. Its only the impression of something larger. Something missing. I've been able to piece together something, based on what I saw of my apartment. I lived a spare life. The most used piece of furniture in my apartment is the reclining chair. The bed barely seems slept in. The chair, I can sit in it, recline it, and feel the way it hugs my body like an old friend. It sleeps well. My clothes were mostly gone when I got there. Maybe I'd packed them away for the last job, and lost the case along the way. Though it feels more like someone went through my things. I wonder, briefly, if it was Blue Streak, my chauffeur. The thought rises, then passes over. He's not the kind that would be sent to handle that. No. It would have been someone else. I wonder what conclusions they were worried about me coming to, based on what I wore. 

I shuffle in the seat, getting a little more comfortable as we sit on the stakeout. Blue Streak blinks, he flicks his gaze back to the front, instead of to the side, to me. I reach out and grab hold of the paper cup of coffee from the gas station. It's black. The taste feels familiar. I think I've had a lot of black, gas station coffee. I follow that back to the thoughts of my apartment. back to the thoughts of what I found there. The sparse details that help me make up the small picture I have of myself right now. The spices. There was one thing I could determine from them. The smell of the spices clinging to the walls. They were from Mexicolt. Someone had tried to scrub things down, but there was no way to get all of the smell out. That little detail left me some room to play with. There weren't many stallions or mares from Mexicolt in the force. Those that were, they got different treatment from me. I don't know yet whether it's because they're not. 

I stop. 

Again, the trouble of what to call myself. What to call the state I'm in right now.

The taste of the word experiment is tangy. It has an iron, bloody trill on my tongue. I don't know what else to use though. Despite the unpleasant connotations. The unpleasant feeling of having it apply to me, nothing else feels right. Everything else feels like I'm trying to bury the truth. 

An experiment, then. Maybe the others get different treatment because they're not experiments. Because they're not checked by doctors when they come back. Topped up with things I don't know the name of. Only the look, and the feeling when they hit my veins. I don't think that's all though. I think there's something of a tension between the regular folks and those from Mexicolt. One of the civilians said something last week, when Blue Streak and I were on call. We were taking her statement after helping handle a robbery. Her green eyes were on me, despite Blue Streak doing most of the talking. Owner of the liquor store. She saw me burst in. Saw me grab the barrel of the robber's shotgun. She saw me bend it to a ninety degree angle. I think that did something to her. When we turned, she said something under her breath. 

"Blueback."

I didn't take any notice of it. Resolved to look it up later. Found I couldn't look it up. I had to find somebody on my off hours at a local bar. It took a few beers worth of convincing for them to tell me about it. Something about turncoats. Something about leaving your real colors behind to work for the man. I spent the rest of the night thinking about that. Whoever that liquor store owner was, she thought I'd left something behind. Betrayed something, because of where I am now. An assumption, based on the way I look? My accent, maybe? Or, did she know me? I hadn't been able to figure out, one way or another. I could go back there. I didn't want to. Not yet. I felt that would be tipping my hand too much to whoever I'm playing against. I don't want them to know I'm looking into who I was. I want them to think I'm satisfied. Happy with the current state of things. Still. There's that stirring beneath the surface. Maybe she knows something I can use. 

My eyes flit to something in front of me before I really understand why. My hooves are still passing the cup of coffee to my lips. There's someone in front of us. A stallion. He isn't the one we're looking for. Blue Streak doesn't even react to him. The stallion in front is shifty though. Moving slow. Casting what he thinks are surreptitious glances over his shoulder. He's about as obvious as can be about it though. Shows he's either new, or he's about as suited to field work as a fish is to playing tennis. I pass my coffee to the cupholder. My hoof goes to the side of the seat. I press down on the lever with a gentle touch. The seat flattens itself to my back and comes with me as I lean forward. I watch the stallion head around the side of the building. Blue Streak is paying a little more attention by now. Either because I'm paying attention, or because he noticed that the building that stallion went in, is the one we're waiting for the meet to go down at. Simple bust for contraband substances. We're watching for the local dealer. Specializes in Beam. Pegasus. Green hair. Tan coat. Goes by Weedwhacker and tends to have an overinflated sense of his own pride. I give the stallion that went around the corner a few moments before I get out of the auto. I'm in nondescript clothes. Black leathers. Shiny buckles. Ronin band T-shirt. Old jeans. Pair of steel hooved boots. Nice and heavy. Perfect for kicking down doors and knocking someone's hips out of joint. Streak is slipping out of his side by the time I'm halfway across the street. He takes his time. He doesn't want to be there first off. I'm used to it. Walking in alone is better for me anyway. I don't think Streak is really tailing me, but you don't have to be smart to run your mouth, and I don't know who Streak is running his mouth to. The best kinds of spies are ones that don't know what they are. 

I move up without making much noise. I can hear the stallion ahead of me still. Despite his paranoia, he doesn't seem to be listening out for much. Only looking. Classic mistake. Unless someone's coming at you down the street or across an open field, you'll usually see them before you can hear them. I keep following him. My steps matching the rhythm of his. He doesn't seem to notice the fact that there are two distinct sets. Judging from how he acted as he went in, I don't think he's savvy enough to pretend not to notice. He gets to a door around the back side of the building. He goes in. I walk to the corner and dip my head around for a moment. No one else there. No guard posted at the door. Nothing. Matches what I'm expecting. Weedwhacker isn't disliked enough by any of the locals in this hood to need any real protection. Stayed mostly off of cop radar. Thought that meant we didn't know about him or didn't care. Also a mistake. Sometimes its about waiting until the fruit is ripe enough to pick it. Why bring someone in early on with charges that might not stick, when I can bring someone in with nice, heavy charges that can nail his dick to the floor?

I approach the door. I take a few moments to listen at it. Waiting for a sign of hoofsteps behind it. Waiting for a sign of shuffling. Breathing. Nothing. I flatten myself to the side of the wall and start to ease the door open. I pull my sidearm from its holster at my side. The door opens all the way to the other wall. I aim and sweep from the sliver I can see until I've cleared the entire hallway beyond the door. Brownish metal fittings that might have come that way or might be rust. Shitty white paint cracked, peeling, turned yellow in some places from water damage. Not a place that anyone bothers to keep up anymore. Forgotten, except by people who want to lurk around the fringes. I leave the door open for Streak. He might follow. Might stay at the side of the auto to wait for a radio check in from me. Either way, I need to keep moving. Find out where Whacker's deal is going down. There are a few doors about twenty feet inside the hallway. A spot where the hallway breaks off into a larger room from there. I can see the vague outline of a catwalk in the light coming from the doorway. None of the lights in here are working worth. The overheads probably don't even have bulbs anymore. Its clear that scavengers had their pick of this place. 

Further in. Hoofstep by hoofstep. The revolver in my forelegs is nice and heavy. The weight is comfortable. Something that feels like it's been by my side for a while. The way my hooves fit to its grip. The way it feels worn down in the same way it feels natural for me to hold it. That tells me it has to be mine. Has to be a genuine part of my past. I listen for a brief half minute at each of the doors along the path. None of them bear any fruit. Nobody behind them. That leaves where I expected the deal to be going down. The factory floor. I come to the edge of the catwalk. I can see the floor is stripped of machines. All across are shadows. Almost like blast shadows, where the outline of their bulk used to be. Some beltless conveyor systems are still in place. Probably too hard to strip out for the amount you could get for them. There's a card table set up down there. I spot the stallion I followed in. Electric aquamarine streak in his otherwise black mane. Grayish, almost stone colored coat. Weedwhacker sits across from him. Zoned out look spread across his features. Duffel bag next to him. Mane dye sets a small case down. Whacker pops it. I get comfortable at my spot on the catwalk. Half paying attention to the deal going on below. Half watching the edges of this place for any sign of other participants in the deal. Maybe someone watching over it. Maybe someone hired to interrupt it. Not likely, but it pays to keep an open mind. Someone's always running a scheme. There's always an angle. 

Weedwhacker nods at what's in the case. I can make out his voice from my position. Low, relaxed. 

"All there bud. Heh. Bud. Thanks for doing the pickup for me. Fuzzy buddies have been a little hot on my ass lately."

Whacker slides the case over to himself. He sets it down next to him. He picks up the duffel bag. Whacker tosses it onto the table. 

"Give her a check. You know this stuff better than I do. Make sure."

Nobody else here. I check the cam I'm wearing. Recording. Just like it has been since I stuck it on this morning. Supervisor said they're an import from Bittain. Something to do with the mayor working on bringing the APQPD into twenty first century policing. At least, that's the line I was fed. 

Mane dye opens the duffel. I'm in a position to see inside. It looks like some fat box. The corners rounded off. All in white plastic and brushed steel. The interesting thing, is that I recognize the stamp on the side. A starry night sky, said to be a replica of Luna's cutie mark, with the red words EASA spread over it. Equestrian Aeronautics and Space Administration. 

Mane dye's eyes go a little wide when he sees it. As if he wasn't really expecting it to be there. This is a little bigger than I was expecting it to be. Whacker must have an in with someone at the administration's base. I take a deep breath. I push myself up from where I got comfortable leaning against the catwalk. I make my way down the metal stairs. Neither of the stallions at the table notice me. Their eyes are on each other. Well, Whacker's eyes are on Mane Dye. Mane Dye is eyeing up the product. Must be some kind of techie. 

I approach from behind Mane Dye. My gun is steady in my hoof. Whacker notices me when I'm about fifteen feet away from the table. His face blanches. His eyes widen. The pupils track the movement of the gun in my hooves. Mane Dye notices a few seconds after that. I pick that time to start the spiel. 

"APQPD. On the ground. Eyes to the floor. Move and it's a bullet in the leg."

Weedwhacker considers bolting. I can see it from the way his eyes flick to some spot behind him. Must be another way out. 

I send a bullet over his left shoulder. His chest starts heaving up and down. Doesn't bolt though. He gets down. Mane Dye follows shortly after. Streak chooses that time to show up. He slips in through the doorway behind me. Glides down next to me. 

"Cuffs. I'll haul them back to the auto. Goods are a case and a duffel. You got that?"

Streak nods. 

"Got it. We need to do a sweep of the building after?"

"Couldn't hurt, but I doubt we'll find anything else."

"Mmm."

Streak gets the cuffs on Weedwhacker. I keep my gun on him. Mane Dye doesn't look too interested in moving. His eyes are screwed shut. Breathing heavier than the drug pusher across from him. Streak cuffs Mane Dye. I holster my sidearm. Both of us get to work clearing the scene. One pair of cuffs to link Whacker and Mane Dye together. Another pair to link both of them to my right hind leg. Might let them pull me to the ground, but they can't mess with either of the limbs I'd use to shoot them for that. I take the perps back up the stairs, out, and around to the cruiser. The back pops open after I jiggle the key in the hole for a bit. Whacker goes in first. Then Mane Dye. It's while he's going in that Mane Dye actually works up the courage to open his eyes again. He looks at me for a moment. I can see confusion on his face. Odd. It doesn't stop me from slamming the door and locking it again. I wait for Streak to get back with the duffel and the suitcase. We load those in the boot. 

Streak gets in the driver's seat. I get in the passenger. 

"Station?" He asks.

"Station." I reply. 

It's about fifteen minutes back. Both of us head inside to the check in and processing desk. The secretary is waiting for us. She's an older mare. Cat's eye glasses. Cigarette holder, black. Semi-upmarket dress. Mane pulled back into a tight bun. 

"You two are back early. I take it you found something for us?"

"Weedwhacker, and some face neither of us recognize."

I catch the sound of a confused noise behind me. A shuffle of hooves. 

"Can we get an interrogation room? I figure Streak can handle Whackjob."

"Not my name officer, that joke hasn't been funny since you were in high school."

"And I'll take the newbie, once you get his picture and hoofprints for the file."

I reach back and pat the shy perp on the back. He seems to be afraid of me. Moreso than I usually get. Could just be his first time having a gun go off around him. Might be throwing him off. 

"I'll get some coffee ready for the both of us. I'm sure he has a long explanation for all this and I'm real interested to hear it."

Streak and I pass our two perps off to the officers handling incoming. Weedwhacker doesn't require much work. Most of his stuff is already on file from a few misdemeanors he came in on before. The new boy though. They're still working on him as I pass on and head towards the station's kitchen. I grab the pot and pour myself a mug of coffee. Streak comes by. I pour him one too. Then a third for the stallion I'm about to be grilling for the next few hours. Well, I assume it'll be hours. Maybe he'll break easy. 

"Well, paperwork time Posy."

Streak takes a sip of his coffee. I heave the theatrical sigh that's expected of me after a comment like that. 

"Yeah."

I take a sip of my coffee. 

"Paperwork time."

He nods to me. Streak grabs a bear claw and heads out the door of the kitchen. I hear his hoofsteps going down the hall. I take my time with grabbing the coffee and a doughnut for myself. Bullvarian cream. Then I'm out the door of the kitchen. Down the hallway. I find the interrogation room with the card for my perp in a minute. I grab the file, skim over it, and head inside. 

"So, Mister Vega, there anything you want to tell me?"

The door shuts behind me with a gentle pressure from my hind hoof. The stallion leans over the table that he's cuffed to. 

"What the hell is going on? Why are you acting like you don't know me and why are you...here?"

I let my tongue run over my lips. 

Jackpot.

# Chapter 6

The first thing I do is check the door. I try not to let anything show on my face. I'm sure something does come across. I doubt that the kid sitting at the table can piece together anything that'll be useful to him. Probably not even anything that comes close to the truth of the matter. He'll likely assume it's all a trick to get a confession. Maybe I can play that angle.

The door is secure. Should be nobody listening at it. It's heavy, and there's no way that anything can drift under the jamb as far as sound. The lock clicks shut. I move back towards the chair. My eyes briefly go to the cams on the wall. They won't be watching this, I imagine. It'll be viewed later. I can make an excuse to head into the security room and conveniently misplace the recording somewhere. 

So, that leaves me with the kid, Vega. 

"Why don't you tell me what's going on, Mister Vega?"

I takes a deep breath. It swells my chest under the uniform. More than enough to catch his eye. I reach for the cup of coffee. It comes to my lips for a brief kiss of heat and good, bitter, black coffee. 

"There's a lot that seems to be going on. That module, I think that's what it's called right? A module? From some EAPA project?"

I wait for him to volunteer something. He's conflicted. Thinking about what he could say. What angle I could be working this stuff from. 

"Look. I needed it, alright? I got left high and dry after the job. The payout wasn't as good as we all wanted it to be. Guessing that *most* of the agreed upon amount ended up going to you. The best that the rest of us got was..."

He makes a short, low noise of frustration deep in his throat. The chains of his cuffs jangle on the table. 

"We got told to take what we got, shut up, get out, and stay gone. It was barely enough to make a difference. Not worth the trouble."

Time to make an educated guess. 

I raise my hoof and tap at the side of my face. The side that makes a metal tink when my hooftip touches it. 

"I think one of us sacrificed a little more than the other."

He blanches a little at that. I can imagine the kind of image that just popped into his head. It's not pretty. From the stories they told me about what all went into the reconstruction of my head, I'm thinking he saw a lot of pink and red and twitching. 

"Y-yeah, but I was still in the line of fire. We still risked our lives for that shit."

He spits the word shit out. Like he expects it to give him some standing. Some footing in the back and forth. Can't have that. 

"You left me for dead, and the shit job you *did* leading up to that is what ended up getting me laid out on a slab. Considering the work you did? What you got caught doing today? I'm not surprised. Only thing that boggles my mind is how you ended up doing this crap in the first place. You *reek* of programming socks and doeritos. Since when did you get out of your DOS den and throw yourself at bad guys that aren't made of ones and zeros?"

Vega goes quiet. He doesn't reply for a good bit. Long enough that I decide to look away. Focus my eyes on the wall clock. Give him some time to piece his thoughts together. Give him time to get angry, or to break. Either way comes with a lot of opportunity for me to goad him into giving more details.

"It was supposed to be simple. That's what they sold it to us as. We'd get in, back some folks up, delay for the fuzz, and get paid. It wasn't supposed to go like that. Not from what they told us."

"Why don't you tell me exactly who this *they* is and who this *we* group is? If you cooperate and play nice, these charges could be dropped. Weedwhacker seems to be the mastermind behind your recent fiasco. I'd be more than happy to put him away, and let you off easy. If you work with me on this."

"Sure..."

He looks up at me. Still that strange glint in his eyes. The one that lets me know he has more on his mind than he's letting on with his words. Thank Luna that no one taught this idiot to have a poker face. 

"Okay, sure, I'll work with you. What do I...what do you want me to do?"

"First, you're going to tell me everything about our prior association, for the record. Then, you're going to let me know about this new deal that you were working on with Weedwhacker, and how he forced you into it against your will."

"He didn't force..."

The look I give him stops him in his tracks. I gesture with one hooftip for him to roll back that idea. He closes his mouth. He re-thinks his current situation. 

"Yeah, he knew some folks I care about and was going to hurt them if I didn't do what he wanted. He needed me to look into this thing for him. Yeah."

"Now, for the record, so our previous association is documented."

"...yeah. Gotcha. It all started going wrong when we were in the back of the van."
