## Frequently Asked Questions

## Q - What can I do to protect my Equus Soft system from unwanted intrusion?

Unwanted intrusion can come in many forms. Hackers exploit various vulnerabilities in the hardware, software, and often the equine (that's you) component of the system. To prevent this from happening, we recommend using some of the robust safety options afforded by our partners at Midnight Cyber-security. They have a fantastic suite of products guaranteed to protect you from any virus, spyware, or malware that you may come into contact with. 


## Q - What can I do to make sure I have the latest Equus Soft releases so that my system is up to date?

Keeping up with the radical pace of Equus Soft would be difficult for any user on their own. That's why we offer automatic updates on every Equus Soft system currently deployed. While it is possible to opt out of this automatic update, we do not recommend you do so. These updates are often integral for continued system function as technology progresses, both for the system's ability to function, and its ability to ward off dangerous attempts to subvert it. 

## Q - What is Equus Soft?

Equus Soft is a company focused largely on its operating system offerings. We are the most used OS across the world, and many programs are developed to function with our operating system in mind. We're dedicated to providing a way for every creature to engage with the modern world. No matter who they are or where they are.

## Q - What is Equus Soft's Attitude Toward Competition?

We're perfectly happy to have competition! It fosters a healthy environment and gives consumers a choice. However, we believe that Equus Soft is the best choice out there, so we earnestly hope that anyone developing cutting edge software uses Equus Soft's developer tools. It's easy to knock together the skeleton of an app using them, and build everything out from there. There's a fine selection of services that were produced using our development kit. Stable Manager, Burger Princess' Monarch system, and the Ladybug drone's AI, just to name a few. So we like to think of competition in the business as more friendly cooperation!
