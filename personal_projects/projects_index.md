# Personal Projects

This is where all my personal projects are. Mostly these are things that I've just worked on for fun, to help out friends, or so that I have something custom to help me. If you find anything here that you like or you want to use, please reach out. I'd love to work with you. 

I've organized this so that from here, you'll just be taken to the main writeup in the README files for each project. If you want to look at the full project files for each of these, there's a link right under the one for the readme that will take you to the public github page.

### poker_stats

Streamlit App for helping to understand Texas Hold 'Em odds. Does not take into account counterlogical intuition of modern Poker AI (tracking the behavior of users between hands) This streamlit app just handles advisement on a purely logical basis by modeling all the possible outcomes of the game and the likelihood of facing stronger vs. weaker hands.
