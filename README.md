# Description of files

## pax

This directory contains various files for TTRPG games, mostly Pax Equus.

### armitageJournal

This is the directory for armitage's Journal. It's a place meant to be a fun display for the journal of one of my main characters in Pax. She's been my main character throughout the majority of the game, so I thought she deserved a nice little spot for her thoughts to be made manifest.

### Pax sheet maker

This is a tool for users to create their own character sheet for Pax Equus, it should cover all the needs and wants of a typical player character in the game and may even prove useful for throwing together some highly detailed NPCs for the DM

### macros_and_instruc

This one is for all the macros and instructions I've found useful when playing roll20 games and some help in making your own.

This is a repository for various writing projects that are worthy enough to see the light of day.







# TODO

- [ ] Fix JSON import not keeping character portrait, not re-selecting the race, not re-selecting traits, not remembering how many trait points were used. Attempted some fixes, they have not worked, check to see what can and can't be done with the JSON
- [ ] Attempted to fix the CSS margin styling for skills and proficiencies a couple times to no effect, keep playing with it and label anything that hasn't worked with a commment
- [ ] Work on the text parser that's helping me convert Wonderful Cowboy Land's chat log into an easily readable book style narrative. Consider training an AI on OOC conversations and IC conversations that can then parse through it for me and make all the minor edits necessary.
