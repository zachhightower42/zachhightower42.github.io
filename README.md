# Description of files

## pax

This directory contains various files for TTRPG games, mostly Pax Equus.

### armitageJournal

This is the directory for armitage's Journal. It's a place meant to be a fun display for the journal of one of my main characters in Pax. She's been my main character throughout the majority of the game, so I thought she deserved a nice little spot for her thoughts to be made manifest.

This is a repository for various writing projects that are worthy enough to see the light of day.







# TODO
- [ ] Consider adding shopping functionality, maybe in a seperate page
- [ ] Add inventory whenever I add the shopping functionality
- [ ] Add level up function +2 Skill points, +2 PP, and +1 Trait per level up.
- [ ] Add the ability to export as a .json file that can be loaded back in to make edits and do other fun stuff
- [ ] Work on giving Armitage's journal another background element that makes it appear you're reading it from a book.
