# Description of files

## pax

This directory contains various files for TTRPG games, mostly Pax Equus.

### armitageJournal

This is the directory for armitage's Journal. It's a place meant to be a fun display for the journal of one of my main characters in Pax. She's been my main character throughout the majority of the game, so I thought she deserved a nice little spot for her thoughts to be made manifest.

### Pax sheet maker

This is a tool for users to create their own character sheet for Pax Equus, it should cover all the needs and wants of a typical player character in the game and may even prove useful for throwing together some highly detailed NPCs for the DM

### macros_and_instruc

This one is for all the macros and instructions I've found useful when playing roll20 games and some help in making your own.

# TODO

- [ ] Improve the styling of the skills and proficiencies section
- [ ] Fix JSON not keeping character portrait, not re-selecting the race, not re-selecting traits, put the import and export buttons into their own specific section at the bottom of the page
- [ ] Fix the styling for the character bio input area so that it is a little bit smaller on the right side
- [ ] Give all prompts given to the user the same styling as that of the prompt for how many items they want to remove from their inventory, as this is the best looking so far
