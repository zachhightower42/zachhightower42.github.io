# Description of files

## pax

This directory contains various files for TTRPG games, mostly Pax Equus.

### armitageJournal

This is the directory for armitage's Journal. It's a place meant to be a fun display for the journal of one of my main characters in Pax. She's been my main character throughout the majority of the game, so I thought she deserved a nice little spot for her thoughts to be made manifest.

### Pax sheet maker

This is a tool for users to create their own character sheet for Pax Equus, it should cover all the needs and wants of a typical player character in the game and may even prove useful for throwing together some highly detailed NPCs for the DM

### macros_and_instruc

This one is for all the macros and instructions I've found useful when playing roll20 games and some help in making your own. 


## zacharyHightowerCollectedWorks

This is a repository for various writing projects that are worthy enough to see the light of day.

### narrative_work

This index is going to just be a bunch of youtube embeds of my audiobooks/other VA work.


## poker_stats

Project folder for a python app that tracks how good a given poker hand in is in  Texas Hold 'Em. It need some improvements with regard to hand calculation and user experience. 




# TODO

- [ ] Remove any character portrait saving from the JSON portions of the pax sheet maker. Add in a small popup that tells the user  that the character portrait won't be saved when exporting as a JSON and to have it somewhere seperate on their local machine. 
- [ ] Attempted to fix the CSS margin styling for skills and proficiencies a couple times to no effect, keep playing with it and label anything that hasn't worked with a commment
- [ ] Restructure the idea of how the text parser and rewriter will work with the chat logs from Wonderful Cowboy Adventure Time. I need a workable basis that is sure to get me the results I want in the end. Currently, I think the main issue is to get it organized, and get a few scenes rewritten so that they flow correctly. 
- [ ] Look back through poker stats to make notes and add documentation, maybe find areas that could use improvement like hand input ease of access. Giving the ability to put in something like 'as' to get ace of spades so on, so forth.
