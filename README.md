# Description of files

## pax

This directory contains various files for TTRPG games, mostly Pax Equus.

### armitageJournal

This is the directory for armitage's Journal. It's a place meant to be a fun display for the journal of one of my main characters in Pax. She's been my main character throughout the majority of the game, so I thought she deserved a nice little spot for her thoughts to be made manifest.

# TODO

- [ ] Add the ability to export as a .json file that can be loaded back in to make edits and do other fun stuff
- [ ] Make it so that the user gets prompted about how many of an item he wants to remove when there are multiple. Box for them to type in the amount or a button next to it that says all. Plus one for cancel, just in case
- [ ] Improve the styling of the skills and proficiencies section
